\par\par \uc2 LETTER FROM WASHINGTON\par \uc2 Politics; SECT\par \b \uc2 Contests in New Hampshire May Alter Political Map\b0\par\par\uc2 By ALBERT R. HUNT | BLOOMBERG VIEW \par \uc2 720 \uc2 words\par \uc2 19 September 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 The New York Times on the Web\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 New Hampshire is in the bottom quarter of states in terms of its electoral and popular votes in the United States presidential race. But no other place has more competitive races with national implications.\par \par \uc2 The presidential contest, a Senate race, both House seats and the \uc2 election\uc2  for governor are all up for grabs. The outcomes could shape the 2017 political map.\par \par \uc2 It is worth remembering the state's crucial role in 2000. Despite all the attention to Florida, if Al Gore had taken New Hampshire -- he lost by 7,000 votes -- he would have won the electoral as well as the popular vote.\par \par \uc2 This year, the Republican nominee, \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , has advantages in the state. He won a huge victory in the February primary, while on the Democratic side, \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  was soundly defeated by Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont. Only 4 percent of New Hampshire's voters are minorities, a Democratic base, and almost 57 percent of the likely electorate is made up of noncollege-educated whites, the seventh-highest rate in the country for a group that tends to favor Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Yet in the last six presidential races, the once reliably Republican state has voted Democratic five times; \uc2 Barack Obama\uc2  twice won decisively. The Democratic campaign in the state is much better organized.\par \par \uc2 As in most of America, the focus is on the evils of the other candidate. Last week, Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's running mate, Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia, drew a boisterous cheer from a crowd in Exeter when he referred to Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's infatuation with President \uc2 Vladimir V. Putin\uc2  of Russia: ''If you can't tell the difference between dictatorship and leadership, then you have no business being president,'' he said.\par \par \uc2 Five hours later, enthusiastic supporters packed a gymnasium in Laconia to hear Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 . In his fourth visit to the state since the primaries in February, he accused Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  of corruption and blamed her for every major failure in the Middle East, including a ''central role in unleashing ISIS.'' Along with forcing Mexico to pay for a border wall, he vowed to make the Middle East Gulf states pay for a refugee haven, claiming that these states would not exist ''for very long'' without United States support. For good measure, he asserted that New Hampshire lost one in three manufacturing jobs in President Obama's economy. (The state's unemployment rate is 2.9 percent, the second lowest in the country.)\par \par \uc2 The state's largest newspaper, The New Hampshire Union Leader, last week endorsed the Libertarian candidate, \uc2 Gary Johnson\uc2 . The outcome may hinge on how much independents -- who account for about 40 percent of the state's electorate -- support Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  or the third-party candidates. The \uc2 election\uc2  forecaster Nate Silver still rates Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's chance of winning at 64 percent.\par \par \uc2 New Hampshire also features this cycle's most heavyweight Senate race: the Republican incumbent Kelly Ayotte against Gov. Maggie Hassan, a Democrat. They are both smart, popular and well known -- to voters, they are just Kelly and Maggie. Both national parties think that they will win the seat, and outside groups are pouring in millions of dollars, making WMUR, the TV station in Manchester, the only sure winner.\par \par \uc2 The Republican ticket causes Ms. Ayotte some discomfort. She says she supports Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , though she will not endorse him. Earlier, she called on the Republican representative Frank Guinta to resign after he was sanctioned for campaign finance violations; he won his primary last week.\par \par \uc2 Ms. Hassan ties Ms. Ayotte to Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  at every opportunity. In a brief interview, Ms. Hassan said Ms. Ayotte ''stands with \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2 , even though prominent members of her own party say he presents a clear and present danger to the country.''\par \par \uc2 Republicans say Ms. Ayotte's willingness to criticize both the Republican presidential nominee and Mr. Guinta appeals to independent voters.\par \par \uc2 Naturally, much of the national focus is on big battlegrounds like Florida and Ohio. But the Granite State may provide important indicators early on \uc2 election\uc2  night. If Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  loses the state, any path to victory will be elusive. Likewise, Democratic hopes of taking control of the Senate may be dashed if Ms. Hassan loses.\par \par \uc2 Document NYTF000020160919ec9j00045\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 MEDIATOR\par \uc2 Business/Financial Desk; SECTB\par \b \uc2 Old Hands Help Russia Navigate U.S. Media\b0\par\par\uc2 By JIM RUTENBERG; Oleg Matsnev and Zachary Wichter contributed research. \par \uc2 1,524 \uc2 words\par \uc2 19 September 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 1\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Last week, I caught Larry King on his post-CNN media perch, the RT America television network. His guest, the actress and activist Kamala Lopez, was powerfully emotional as she called for the ratification of the Equal Rights Amendment.\par \par \uc2 Just as intriguing was the RT host and former MSNBC personality Ed Schultz. His program on Wednesday, for instance, featured a fairly typical discussion about Colin Powell's leaked emails. One unique feature of the conversation, however, was what it did not include: any mention of Russia's suspected connection to the leak.\par \par \uc2 But what do you expect? RT America is the United States version of Russia Today, the global satellite network financed by the Russian government. You can watch it on \uc2 Dish Network\uc2 ; on cable in select cities like New York, Los Angeles and Philadelphia; or online anywhere.\par \par \uc2 If we lived in normal times -- with perspective and some minimal grounding in history -- a reader would now ask: ''WHAT? Larry King and Ed Schultz are on a Russian state-financed television outlet? Part of the network President \uc2 Vladimir Putin\uc2  formed a few years ago to 'break the Anglo-Saxon monopoly on the global information streams?'''\par \par \uc2 But, of course, we don't live in normal times.\par \par \uc2 These are, after all, the times of \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , who sat for an interview himself this month on Mr. King's show, ''Politicking.'' Democrats and uneasy Republicans seized upon Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's RT appearance, in which he said he was skeptical of United States intelligence officials' high confidence that Russia was involved in hacking \uc2 Democratic National Committee\uc2  email.\par \par \uc2 But what of Mr. King, one of the most famous and recognizable interviewers in American television history? And how about Mr. Schultz?\par \par \uc2 They are the most visible examples of Russia's aggressive attempt to use our free press to make mischief in our political process -- lending legitimacy to a network that has at times trafficked in Sept. 11 conspiracy theories, posted one-sided news from Ukraine and presented particularly grim views of the United States and its efforts around the world.\par \par \uc2 That two well-known American cable news hosts would so blithely sign up with a network Russia has financed with the explicit purpose of forwarding its view of the world says something about the extreme -- and extremely cynical -- media relativism that has fallen upon the land.\par \par \uc2 With the increase in partisan media and partisan media criticism, suspicions run high that every news organization is working some sort of political angle. These days, the accepted truth of a journalistic statement of fact can depend on the politics of the audience it's presented to. In this environment, you can see why RT can seem like just another entrant with an agenda.\par \par \uc2 John Dickey, the chief executive of \uc2 Ora Media\uc2  -- the production company that owns Mr. King's Russia Today programming, which is also streamed on \uc2 Hulu\uc2  and Ora's site -- told me, ''We're a content provider; we're doing business with people who want and value our content.''\par \par \uc2 As for RT's political bent, he said, ''What media outlet isn't taking sides in this \uc2 election\uc2 ?''\par \par \uc2 But, wittingly or not, Mr. Schultz and Mr. King are playing the equestrians to Russia's Trojan horse (or, as The Daily Beast called them in an article last week, ''Manchurian anchors'').\par \par \uc2 ''Their strategy is very clear: to create the appearance of being a legitimate source of news,'' Michael McFaul, a senior fellow at the \uc2 Hoover Institution\uc2  and a former United States ambassador to Russia, said of RT. ''Having people like Larry King work for them helps them achieve their objective.''\par \par \uc2 Both Mr. King and Mr. Schultz say RT's management has never told them what to say or not say.\par \par \uc2 ''I have never -- never -- been edited or had a show of mine not run,'' Mr. King, 82, told me.\par \par \uc2 Mr. King is not an employee of RT. The network licenses ''Politicking'' and ''Larry King Now'' -- which was nominated for a Daytime Emmy this year -- from Ora, which Mr. King co-owns with the Mexican billionaire \uc2 Carlos Slim\uc2  (who is also a major shareholder of The \uc2 New York Times\uc2 ).\par \par \uc2 Mr. King said that he was not all that familiar with the rest of RT's programming because he did not get the network at home, and that he might decide against his announced plans to help host its United States \uc2 election\uc2 -night coverage.\par \par \uc2 Why the affiliation? ''They pay us a lot of money, and we need money to pay our producers and directors,'' Mr. King said.\par \par \uc2 Mr. King differentiated himself from Mr. Schultz, who works directly for RT and, Mr. King said, has recently seemed supportive of Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  -- ''a completely different Ed Schultz to me, which was a shock to me.''\par \par \uc2 Mr. Schultz generally supported Democrats during his time on MSNBC, which let him go in 2015, and said he did not support Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , the presumed Putin favorite. The difference now, he told me on Friday, is that he is the anchor of a straight news program, which makes him seem kinder to Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  than he would be as an opinion host.\par \par \uc2 He said he did not mention Russia's suspected ties to the hacking of Mr. Powell's emails in the segment I watched last week because ''no one can credibly state they have evidence that it's Russia, and as soon as they do, I'll report it.'' (Security experts in the United States have linked the breach to a notorious Russian military hacking group known as Fancy Bear.)\par \par \uc2 A passionate defender of RT America, Mr. Schultz likened RT to the \uc2 BBC\uc2 , which receives some government funding, in an interview with The \uc2 Washington Post\uc2  last week.\par \par \uc2 Yet the \uc2 BBC\uc2 , operating in the wildly free press environment of Britain, has regularly angered prime ministers and members of the government.\par \par \uc2 Several former RT journalists have complained they weren't given such a free hand. That was what Liz Wahl said when she resigned from the network in dramatic fashion after Russia seized Crimea from Ukraine in 2014. RT covered the action as a rightful reunification move, echoing Mr. Putin.\par \par \uc2 ''I cannot be part of a network funded by the Russian government that whitewashes the actions of Putin,'' Ms. Wahl told the RT America audience.\par \par \uc2 Another RT America host, Abby Martin, had previously denounced the annexation in an on-air diatribe, which RT pointed to as an example of its openness to opposing viewpoints.\par \par \uc2 Still, The \uc2 New York Times\uc2  reported at the time that the RT editor in chief, Margarita Simonyan, conveyed to Ms. Martin that her statement was ''not in line with our editorial policy.'' The network said it would send Ms. Martin to Crimea for a better understanding. She declined that assignment and has since left the network.\par \par \uc2 Then there is the way that Russia has exerted increasing control over news coverage within its own borders, in ways that help Mr. Putin maintain the image of the strong leader that Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  so admires.\par \par \uc2 Newspapers, websites and broadcasts that break with the party line are pressured to reverse course, and, in the worst cases, forced out of business. Journalists who stray can wind up beaten or dead.\par \par \uc2 Russia has put in place restrictions on foreign media ownership and operations that temporarily forced \uc2 CNN\uc2  to cease transmitting in the country and caused several Western media companies to leave.\par \par \uc2 Moves against the United States government-financed \uc2 Voice of America\uc2  and \uc2 Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty\uc2  led to their removal from all but one of the roughly 100 Russian stations on which they were operating as of 2005, said Jeffrey N. Trimble, a senior official with the \uc2 Broadcasting Board of Governors\uc2  that oversees them.\par \par \uc2 ''The lack of reciprocity is deplorable,'' said Elez Biberaj, the director of the VOA Eurasian division.\par \par \uc2 RT and its defenders say that the network is no more biased than any other news organization and that its critics are trying to silence an alternative that provides a non-Western viewpoint. As Ms. Simonyan put it in a statement to my colleague Michael M. Grynbaum in July, RT is ''providing a perspective you won't get from the mainstream press.''\par \par \uc2 It's a great mark of our democracy that RT is free to do so here. Having a rough-and-tumble oppositional media system may make it harder for our leaders to put on a show of being ''strong'' like Mr. Putin, but there's no question we're all stronger for it in the end.\par \par \uc2 You can call RT America whatever you want -- a news network, a propaganda arm, something in between. Regardless, it's Mr. Putin's. Despite their protests, it sure looks like Larry King and Ed Schultz are, too.\par \par \uc2 Below left, Larry King with Ed Schultz, right, on the set of the show ''Politicking.'' Left, in 2010, Vladimir Putin, as Russia's prime minister, was interviewed by Mr. King for CNN.

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Does it make sense to vote for \uc2 Gary Johnson\uc2 , the Libertarian candidate for president? Sure, as long as you believe two things. First, you have to believe that it makes no difference at all whether \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  or \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  moves into the White House -- because one of them will. Second, you have to believe that America will be better off in the long run if we eliminate environmental regulation, abolish the income tax, do away with public schools, and dismantle Social Security and Medicare -- which is what the Libertarian platform calls for.\par \par \uc2 But do 29 percent of Americans between 18 and 34 believe these things? I doubt it. Yet that, according to a recent \uc2 Quinnipiac\uc2  poll, is the share of millennial voters who say that they would vote for Mr. Johnson if the \uc2 election\uc2  took place now. And the preponderance of young Americans who say they'll back Mr. Johnson or Jill Stein, the Green Party nominee, appear to be citizens who would support Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  in a two-way race; including the minor party candidates cuts her margin among young voters from 21 points to just 5.\par \par \uc2 So I'd like to make a plea to young Americans: your vote matters, so please take it seriously.\par \par \uc2 Why are minor candidates seemingly drawing so much support this year? Very little of it, I suspect, reflects support for their policy positions. How many people have actually read the Libertarian platform? But if you're thinking of voting Johnson, you really should. It's a remarkable document.\par \par \uc2 As I said, it calls for abolition of the income tax and the privatization of almost everything the government does, including education. ''We would restore authority to parents to determine the education of their children, without interference from government.'' And if parents don't want their children educated, or want them indoctrinated in a cult, or put them to work in a sweatshop instead of learning to read? Not our problem.\par \par \uc2 What really struck me, however, was what the platform says about the environment. It opposes any kind of regulation; instead, it argues that we can rely on the courts. Is a giant corporation poisoning the air you breathe or the water you drink? Just sue: ''Where damages can be proven and quantified in a court of law, restitution to the injured parties must be required.'' Ordinary citizens against teams of high-priced corporate lawyers -- what could go wrong?\par \par \uc2 It's really hard to believe that young voters who supported Bernie Sanders in the Democratic primary think any of this is a good idea. But Mr. Johnson and Ms. Stein have received essentially no media scrutiny, so that voters have no idea what they stand for. And their parties' names sound nice: who among us is against liberty? The truth, that the Libertarian Party essentially stands for a return to all the worst abuses of the Gilded Age, is not out there.\par \par \uc2 Meanwhile, of course, it does make a huge difference which of the two realistic prospects for the presidency wins, and not just because of the difference in their temperaments and the degree to which they respect or have contempt for democratic norms. Their policy positions are drastically different, too.\par \par \uc2 True, much of what Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  says is incoherent: in his policy proposals, trillion dollar tax breaks are here today, gone tomorrow, back the day after. But anyone who calls him a ''populist'' isn't looking at the general thrust of his ideas, or at whom he has chosen as economic advisers. Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's brain trust, such as it is, is composed of hard-line, right-wing supply-siders -- whom even Republican economists have called ''charlatans and cranks'' -- for whom low taxes on the rich are the overwhelming priority.\par \par \uc2 Meanwhile, Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  has staked out the most progressive policy positions ever advocated by a presidential candidate. There's no reason to believe that these positions are insincere, that she would revert to 1990s policies in office: What some are now calling the ''new liberal economics'' has sunk deep roots in the Democratic Party, and dominates the ranks of Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's advisers.\par \par \uc2 Now, maybe you don't care. Maybe you consider center-left policies just as bad as hard-right policies. And maybe you have somehow managed to reconcile that disdain with tolerance for libertarian free-market mania. If so, by all means vote for Mr. Johnson.\par \par \uc2 But don't vote for a minor-party candidate to make a statement. Nobody cares.\par \par \uc2 Remember, George W. Bush lost the popular vote in 2000, but somehow ended up in the White House anyway in part thanks to the Nader vote -- and nonetheless proceeded to govern as if he had won a landslide. Can you really imagine a triumphant Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  showing restraint out of respect for all those libertarian votes?\par \par \uc2 Your vote matters, and you should act accordingly -- which means thinking seriously about what you want to see happen to America.\par \par \uc2 Read my blog, The Conscience of a Liberal, and follow me on Twitter, @PaulKrugman.\par \par \uc2 Follow The \uc2 New York Times\uc2  Opinion section on \uc2 Facebook\uc2  and Twitter (@NYTopinion), and sign up for the Opinion Today newsletter.\par \par \uc2 Document NYTF000020160919ec9j00044\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 Foreign Desk; SECTA\par \b \uc2 Obama\uc2 's Last U.N. Visit Mixes Domestic Politics With Diplomatic Tangles\b0\par\par\uc2 By MARK  LANDLER and PETER BAKER; Mark Landler reported from New York, and Peter Baker from Jerusalem. \par \uc2 913 \uc2 words\par \uc2 19 September 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 6\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 President \uc2 Obama\uc2  arrived in New York City on Sunday evening for three days that will mix \uc2 election\uc2 -year politics with a farewell to the world stage at the United Nations. But the visit comes against a suddenly tense backdrop, after a powerful explosion rocked a Manhattan street and a man claiming fealty to the Islamic State stabbed several people in a Minnesota shopping mall.\par \par \uc2 The president's diplomatic schedule also got more complicated. The White House announced Sunday that he would hold meetings at the United Nations with leaders from Israel and China. Both will be closely watched for signs of friction in relationships that have been marked by tension during Mr. Obama's tenure.\par \par \uc2 On Wednesday, he is scheduled to confer with Prime Minister \uc2 Benjamin Netanyahu\uc2  of Israel at a time when he is weighing whether to propose his own framework for a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians over Mr. Netanyahu's objections. The two leaders have clashed repeatedly over the Iran nuclear agreement and Mr. Obama's pursuit of Middle East peace.\par \par \uc2 The meeting could be their last face-to-face encounter before Mr. Obama's term ends in January. Last week, the United States and Israel sealed a $38 billion, 10-year American security aid package to Israel, the largest ever granted to an ally. Officials in both countries have characterized the deal as proof that the American-Israeli relationship is enduring, whatever the strains between the two men.\par \par \uc2 On Monday, Mr. Obama is scheduled to have a brief session with China's premier, \uc2 Li Keqiang\uc2 , a week after North Korea tested another nuclear device. The president is expected to press Mr. Li to use China's influence to discipline the North, something the Chinese have resisted for fear of destabilizing an impoverished neighbor.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Obama returned recently from a trip to Hangzhou, China, which was marred by a messy arrival at the airport that led to shouting matches between American and Chinese officials. Administration officials played down the significance of the episode, saying Mr. Obama's talks with President \uc2 Xi Jinping\uc2  were not affected.\par \par \uc2 This will be Mr. Obama's last appearance at the United Nations, and his aides said he would use it to recall his diplomatic achievements and argue that his multilateral approach is a model for dealing with future crises. But the still-unexplained bombing in New York and the stabbings in Minnesota, which the F.B.I. is treating as a ''potential act of terrorism,'' guarantee that security will be at the forefront.\par \par \uc2 So will presidential politics. Mr. Obama arrived in New York a day earlier than usual so he could attend a fund-raiser in Manhattan for his preferred candidate, \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 . Mr. Obama's motorcade crossed Manhattan on 23rd Street, the site of Saturday's explosion, though several blocks to the east, before arriving at Gramercy Park.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Obama spoke to 65 people at the apartment of the restaurateur Danny Meyer. The guests paid $25,000 each to attend, while the chairmen raised or contributed $250,000 to the Hillary Victory Fund, a joint organization of the \uc2 Clinton\uc2  campaign and the \uc2 Democratic National Committee\uc2  that raises money for Democrats up and down the ballot.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Obama said that despite the gulf in qualifications between Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  and the Republican nominee, \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , the \uc2 election\uc2  was likely to be close because of what he called the ''structural'' polarization of American society. And he spoke more starkly than he had before about the role gender is playing in the race.\par \par \uc2 ''There's a reason why we haven't had a woman president,'' Mr. Obama said. ''We as a society still grapple with what it means to see powerful women. And it still troubles us in a lot of ways, unfairly.''\par \par \uc2 Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  has her own schedule of meetings at the United Nations, including with the presidents of Egypt and Ukraine and the prime minister of Japan. It was not clear whether she planned to meet with Mr. Netanyahu, a leader with whom she had her own clashes while secretary of state.\par \par \uc2 On Sunday, Mr. Obama made clear that now that he had demonstrated a commitment to Israel's security, he planned to press Mr. Netanyahu to move toward reconciliation with the Palestinians.\par \par \uc2 ''The meeting also will be an opportunity to discuss the need for genuine advancement of a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict in the face of deeply troubling trends on the ground,'' \uc2 Josh Earnest\uc2 , the White House press secretary, said in a statement.\par \par \uc2 Left unclear was whether Mr. Obama would go beyond simply urging Mr. Netanyahu. The president is considering whether to publicly lay out his own parameters for a settlement of the long-running conflict, a prospect Mr. Netanyahu has strongly opposed.\par \par \uc2 The president's speech to the General Assembly would be a logical place for such a move, though his advisers say he might wait until after the November \uc2 election\uc2  to avoid its becoming part of campaign politics. If he proceeds, he could give a speech outlining his ideas or even encapsulate them in a resolution before the \uc2 United Nations Security Council\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Aides to Mr. Obama say he has played his cards very close to his chest, not discussing his plans outside a tiny circle.\par \par \uc2 Document NYTF000020160919ec9j0004l\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 The Arts/Cultural Desk; SECTC\par \b \uc2 Emmys Welcome Surprises Along With the Favorites\b0\par\par\uc2 By JOHN KOBLIN \par \uc2 1,750 \uc2 words\par \uc2 19 September 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 1\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 [ The list of Emmy winners | red carpet looks | our critic's review of the show ]\par \par \uc2 LOS ANGELES -- It was business as usual in the two major categories at the Emmys on Sunday night, as \uc2 HBO\uc2 's ''Game of Thrones'' and ''Veep'' repeated as winners for best drama and comedy.\par \par \uc2 But for a ceremony that can be numbingly predictable, the Emmys were energized by a slew of first-time winners in the acting categories and a tour de force in the limited series category by FX's ''The People v. O.J. Simpson: American Crime Story.''\par \par \uc2 The success of the O.J. series set the theme for the evening as Sarah Paulson, Courtney B. Vance and Sterling K. Brown all scored their first Emmy victories. Rami Malek won his first Emmy as well in a wide-open race for best actor in a drama, for his role as the tortured hacker in USA's ''Mr. Robot.'' And in a big upset, Tatiana Maslany won as best actress in a drama for her numerous performances in \uc2 BBC America\uc2 's ''Orphan Black,'' beating out the likes of Robin Wright, Claire Danes and last year's winner, Viola Davis.\par \par \uc2 Kate McKinnon of ''Saturday Night Live'' provided a change of pace, too, upsetting Allison Janney, a seven-time Emmy winner, as best supporting actress for comedy. Likewise, Louie Anderson won his first Emmy in the best supporting comedy category for his role as a suburban mother in FX's ''Baskets.''\par \par \uc2 There was a changing of the guard in the variety category, as \uc2 John Oliver\uc2 's show, ''Last Week Tonight,'' ended the 13-year run of \uc2 Comedy Central\uc2  victories.\par \par \uc2 There were familiar winners as well: In the comedy category, Julia Louis-Dreyfus won her fifth consecutive best actress award for her role on ''Veep,'' and Jeffrey Tambor, for the second year in a row, won for his role as a transgender woman in ''Transparent.''\par \par \uc2 This was the second consecutive year that ''Game of Thrones'' and ''Veep'' took top honors, which helped propel \uc2 HBO\uc2  to six Emmys on Sunday night and 22 Emmys over all (some categories were awarded previously), the biggest haul of any programmer. FX was right behind with 18 wins, including six on Sunday.\par \par \uc2 ''Thrones'' once again led all shows with 12 wins, including three on Sunday, but there is some good news for \uc2 HBO\uc2 's rivals in the drama category: Next year ''Game of Thrones,'' one of TV's most widely praised dramas, will not be eligible for the Emmys; the network elected to start the show's seventh season in the summer 2017, outside of the Emmy-eligibility window.\par \par \uc2 In a sign of the expected Emmys dominance for ''Game of Thrones'' and ''O.J,'' \uc2 Jimmy Kimmel\uc2 , the show's host, said in his opening monologue, ''If your show doesn't have a dragon or a white Bronco in it, go home.''\par \par \uc2 Here are some of the themes and highlights of the evening:\par \par \uc2 New King of Late Night\par \par \uc2 Comedy Central\uc2  had a chokehold on the variety talk show category for years, and a \uc2 Comedy Central\uc2  alumnus took the award on Sunday: Mr. Oliver, for his \uc2 HBO\uc2  show, ''Last Week Tonight.''\par \par \uc2 The show is now in its third season, and the win represents a breakthrough of sorts. The Emmy in this category has been handed out to daily talk shows for years and hasn't been given to a weekly show since Tracey Ullman won for her sketch series ''Tracey Takes On...'' nearly 20 years ago. (Starting last year, variety sketch series and variety talk series were separated into different categories.)\par \par \uc2 Mr. Oliver's triumph is a blow for \uc2 Comedy Central\uc2 , which had won this award for 13 consecutive years between ''The Daily Show'' and ''The Colbert Report.'' Not this year; Trevor Noah, Jon Stewart's replacement, was shut out of the race and not nominated in his first year as host of ''The Daily Show.''\par \par \uc2 But there was some solace in \uc2 Comedy Central\uc2 's night, when ''Key & Peele'' won the best variety sketch series award. The bad news? That is now off the air.\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 Election\uc2  Is an Emmys Hit\par \par \uc2 Not surprisingly, this year's divisive \uc2 election\uc2  played a significant role in this year's ceremony.\par \par \uc2 Lamenting the possibility of a Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2  presidency, Mr. Kimmel lit into the reality show producer Mark Burnett, who was one of the creators of \uc2 NBC\uc2 's ''The Apprentice,'' the show that made Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  a nationwide television star. With ABC's camera firmly squared on Mr. Burnett -- who laughed the entire time, despite the charged barbs -- Mr. Kimmel said that if Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  is elected president, Mr. Burnett is the man to blame.\par \par \uc2 ''If he's elected and he builds that wall, the first person we're throwing over it is Mark Burnett,'' Mr. Kimmel said.\par \par \uc2 Later in the night, after ''The Voice'' won the best reality show, Mr. Burnett, a producer for that show as well, shot back at Mr. Kimmel saying that the host gave ''another five minutes of free publicity'' for Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Mr. Kimmel took the stage afterward and had his own retort: ''That Emmy is going on the hood of \uc2 Trump\uc2 's limousine, isn't it?''\par \par \uc2 And Ms. Louis-Dreyfus, who plays the vice president turned president Selina Meyer, said this upon winning her Emmy for every year she's been nominated in the role: ''Our show started out as a political satire, but it now feels more like a sobering documentary.''\par \par \uc2 The Year of O.J. (and FX)\par \par \uc2 FX's ''The People v. O.J. Simpson: American Crime Story'' was a ratings hit and a darling of critics, and now a big-time Emmy winner.\par \par \uc2 In addition to winning the limited series Emmy, Ms. Paulson, Mr. Vance and Mr. Brown all won acting awards. Mr. Vance and Mr. Brown both beat co-stars to win. Nearly every feature player on the show was nominated for an award, a total of six in all.\par \par \uc2 After Ms. Paulson was named best actress, she got up from her seat and gave a big hug to Marcia Clark, the prosecutor she played in the 10-episode drama, and whom she brought as her guest to the ceremony.\par \par \uc2 Ms. Paulson's performance was a sympathetic one, and it's been a year of redemption for Ms. Clark.\par \par \uc2 ''I, along with the rest of the world, had been superficial and careless in my judgment,'' Ms. Paulson said, choking up as she directed her comments to Ms. Clark. ''And I am glad to be able to stand here today in front of everyone and tell you I'm sorry.''\par \par \uc2 For FX, ''The People v. O.J. Simpson'' was the leader for what was turning out to be its best year at the Emmys ever. ''Fargo'' was also nominated in the limited-series category and, after years of being shut out, FX's critically praised ''The Americans'' finally broke through with three major nominations -- best drama, best actor (Matthew Rhys) and best actress (Keri Russell) -- though it did not win.\par \par \uc2 Controversy (or Lack Thereof)\par \par \uc2 The Oscars have been the subject of withering outrage the last two years for a lack of racial diversity in the acting categories. The Emmys? There's been something closer to silence. No one would argue that TV has fully addressed the issue of race -- it has a problem when it comes to tapping minorities behind the scenes, as the \uc2 Directors Guild of America\uc2  reported last week, and \uc2 CBS\uc2  was criticized in August for a fall lineup featuring familiar white male actors. But nearly two dozen minority actors were nominated for Emmys this year, following Ms. Davis's acting victory a year ago.\par \par \uc2 There were three African-American winners in acting categories Sunday, a notable departure from this year's Academy Awards, in which no minorities were nominated in the acting categories. In addition to wins from Mr. Brown and Mr. Vance, Regina King won the supporting actress in a limited series Emmy for her role in ABC's ''American Crime.'' And ''Key & Peele'' prevailed in the variety sketch award.\par \par \uc2 Instead, attention has turned to the awards themselves, with campaigning having turned into something of a blood sport. In the last two years there has been a 40 percent increase in the number of submissions for the best drama Emmy, according to the Television Academy. And ''for your consideration'' mailers have reached comical proportions, with \uc2 Netflix\uc2  sending out a package to Emmy voters so hefty that it could crush a toe.\par \par \uc2 No Big Leap for Streaming Services\par \par \uc2 For each of the last three years, streaming services like \uc2 Netflix\uc2  and Amazon have become a larger presence at the Emmys. \uc2 Netflix\uc2  had 54 nominations this year, its highest ever, and for the first time, it did better than any of the broadcast networks.\par \par \uc2 But despite the upheaval \uc2 Netflix\uc2  has caused in the industry, the streaming service has yet to have a big Emmys night. Though it collected nine Emmys overall, including three on Sunday, \uc2 Netflix\uc2  continues to strike out in the best drama, best comedy and best actor and actress categories.\par \par \uc2 Ben Mendelsohn did win the Emmy for best supporting actor for his role in ''Bloodline.'' But even with the lavish attention on the presidential \uc2 election\uc2  this year, neither \uc2 Kevin Spacey\uc2  nor Robin Wright won for their roles in the political drama ''House of Cards.'' Neither actor has won a Primetime Emmy Award.\par \par \uc2 For Amazon, Mr. Tambor won again for ''Transparent.''\par \par \uc2 The broadcast networks continued to have a diminished presence at the Emmys. \uc2 NBC\uc2  won two awards Sunday night, and ABC and \uc2 Fox\uc2  won one. \uc2 CBS\uc2  was shut out altogether.\par \par \uc2 DRAMA: SHOW ''Game of Thrones'' ACTRESS Tatiana Maslany ACTOR Rami Malek; COMEDY: SHOW ''Veep'' ACTRESS Julia Louis-Dreyfus ACTOR Jeffrey Tambor; Sarah Paulson was congratulated after winning best actress in a mini-series or movie for ''The People v. O.J. Simpson: American Crime Story.'' More coverage and photos at nytimes.com/arts. (C1); Julia Louis-Dreyfus won her fifth consecutive best actress Emmy for her role on ''Veep.''

\par\par \uc2 National Desk; SECTA\par \b \uc2 Obama Makes a Personal Plea to Black Voters\b0\par\par\uc2 By AMY CHOZICK and JULIE HIRSCHFELD DAVIS \par \uc2 1,319 \uc2 words\par \uc2 19 September 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 1\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 With Democratic leaders increasingly worried about a lack of passion for \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  among young black voters, President Obama is rolling out a new and more personal campaign message: ''It's about me.''\par \par \uc2 The president told African-Americans this weekend he would consider it a ''personal insult'' if they did not vote for Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , implicitly putting his name on the line as his former secretary of state struggles to replicate the coalition that delivered him victories in 2008 and 2012.\par \par \uc2 ''My name may not be on the ballot, but our progress is on the ballot,'' Mr. Obama said on Saturday night at the \uc2 Congressional Black Caucus Foundation\uc2  gala dinner in Washington, where Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  also spoke. ''Tolerance is on the ballot. Democracy is on the ballot. Justice is on the ballot.''\par \par \uc2 Mr. Obama has previously made the case for Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  during campaign stops and in his speech at the Democratic National Convention. But his remarks on Saturday carried a more personal tone, and a tacit acknowledgment that he may be the only one who can bring out the coalition of young, black and Latino voters who Democrats are counting on on Nov. 8.\par \par \uc2 ''That speech went beyond the room. It went beyond the moment,'' said Donna Brazile, the interim chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee. ''That was the president essentially saying, 'Don't leave it on the field.'''\par \par \uc2 During the Democratic primary race, Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  enjoyed tremendous support from African-American voters, especially older black women, who helped her beat back a challenge from Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont.\par \par \uc2 And Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  now holds a gaping advantage of 83 percentage points over the Republican presidential nominee, \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , among black voters, according to a New York Times/CBS News poll released last week.\par \par \uc2 But many Democrats say Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's statistical advantage obscures concerns about turnout and voter apathy.\par \par \uc2 Younger black voters, in particular, have expressed misgivings about Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  because of some of the policies of her husband's administration.\par \par \uc2 These voters specifically point to the 1994 crime bill, which put more police officers on the streets, but also led to tougher sentences for nonviolent drug offenders and the overhaul of welfare, which reduced federal assistance for the poor by nearly $55 billion over six years.\par \par \uc2 In addition, it is hard for Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  to replicate the deep personal affection and pride that many African-Americans feel for Mr. Obama.\par \par \uc2 ''People say, 'It doesn't matter because \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  will get 90 percent of the African-American vote,''' said \uc2 Charlie King\uc2 , a prominent New York Democrat. ''The question is, 'Ninety percent of what?' Turnout makes a difference.''\par \par \uc2 With 50 days until the \uc2 election\uc2 , Minyon Moore, a senior adviser to the \uc2 Clinton\uc2  campaign, called Mr. Obama's remarks on Saturday ''a true wake-up call'' to his coalition of supporters.\par \par \uc2 In part, the speech reflected the president's eagerness to use the outsize sway he has with black voters, especially younger people who had not been engaged in politics before his bids for the White House.\par \par \uc2 But in recent days, advisers to Mr. Obama say, the president has grown exasperated with the tenor of the campaign -- including the re-emergence of questions about his birthplace, an issue that he and many of his supporters have long regarded as racist. While his advisers have suggested his most powerful role in the \uc2 Clinton\uc2  campaign is as a convert who has come to respect his onetime rival, Mr. Obama is also determined to warn his supporters about the dangers of failing to turn out and essentially ceding the presidency to Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Mr. Obama's speech coincided this weekend with massive get-out-the-vote efforts by the \uc2 Clinton\uc2  campaign, including the dispatching of 55,000 volunteers to lead more than 2,000 voter-registration events in Pennsylvania, North Carolina and Ohio.\par \par \uc2 ''Are we where we need to be? Probably not,'' Ms. Moore said. ''Are we going to get to where we need to be? Absolutely.''\par \par \uc2 The blunt and personal language from Mr. Obama seemed to reverberate. By 9 a.m. Sunday, the Rev. Al Sharpton began taking calls from black listeners to his ''Keepin' It Real'' radio program who said they had misgivings about Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , but could not bear to insult Mr. Obama. ''Making not voting synonymous with an insult to the president is a shot in the arm,'' Mr. Sharpton said in an interview.\par \par \uc2 After devoting much of the summer trying to woo white suburban voters turned off by Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , the \uc2 Clinton\uc2  campaign has refocused its efforts to a big turnout push directed at black and young voters.\par \par \uc2 In the weeks since Labor Day, Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  has held rallies before largely black crowds in Cleveland, at a historically black college in Charlotte, N.C., and at a college in Greensboro, N.C.\par \par \uc2 She spoke about her deep ties to black churches while at the \uc2 National Baptist Convention\uc2  in Kansas City, Mo.; she called into \uc2 Tom Joyner\uc2 's radio program when she was home sick with pneumonia; and, this past week, she addressed the Black Women's Agenda Symposium.\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 Clinton\uc2  campaign plans to employ Mr. Obama and the first lady, \uc2 Michelle Obama\uc2 , as much as possible in the coming weeks, making particular use of the couple in Florida, Ohio and North Carolina -- in areas of those states that Mr. Obama won handily in 2008 and 2012.\par \par \uc2 After campaign aides insisted in June that Mr. Obama would not be pigeonholed to reach African-American voters, whose support appeared steady for Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , the campaign has appeared to acknowledge his help is needed, sending him to cities like Philadelphia and Charlotte, which are home to many black voters.\par \par \uc2 ''There's some thought that without him on the ticket, the same enthusiasm might not be there for \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 ,'' said Representative Charles B. Rangel of New York. ''I think it's very smart for the president to say it's not just \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  in the future, it's the wiping out of all the progress we made not just over Obama years, but over the many, many years.''\par \par \uc2 If schedules permit, the campaign would like to organize another rally featuring Mr. Obama and Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  side by side. ''It's a little bit of magic when they're on stage together,'' Ms. Moore said.\par \par \uc2 In a panel discussion this weekend in Washington, Marc H. Morial, the chief executive of the \uc2 National Urban League\uc2 , forcefully told a young woman who suggested that some people may not vote because of frustration that ''this is not the first generation to be frustrated and not voting is not a viable nor intelligent strategy.''\par \par \uc2 Mr. King and Mr. Morial are also participating in ''\uc2 Barack Obama\uc2 Election\uc2  Day,'' a designated day on Nov. 1 during which civil rights leaders will seek to engage African-Americans in battleground states around issues, such as an overhaul of the criminal justice system, which Mr. Obama championed. ''It's all about creating some enthusiasm around this race, if not necessarily around a candidate,'' Mr. King added.\par \par \uc2 Not everyone finds that pitch or Mr. Obama's remarks compelling, especially given that African-Americans have been such a loyal voting bloc for the Democrats and the Clintons over the years.\par \par \uc2 ''Absolutely hate this framing of the necessity of voting (for Democrats) that places all the blame on marginalized and young folks,'' Vann R. Newkirk II, a writer for The Atlantic, said on \uc2 Twitter\uc2 . ''Black folks have done above and beyond their part already.''\par \par \uc2 Find out what you need to know about the 2016 presidential race today, and get politics news updates via \uc2 Facebook\uc2 , \uc2 Twitter\uc2  and the First Draft newsletter.\par \par \uc2 President Obama spoke on Saturday at the Congressional Black Caucus Foundation gala dinner.

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 For the first time in its 20-year history, Fox News is stumbling. Roger Ailes, its founder and guiding force, has been driven out by embarrassing revelations of repeated sexual harassment. The newsroom is sharply divided, some long-term contributors are leaving, and the channel's parent company has started the expensive process of settling with Mr. Ailes's accusers.\par \par \uc2 This might sound like bad news for the Republican Party, which has tied itself to the network for years. But Fox News has long been a double-edged sword for Republicans, and perhaps nothing illustrates that contradiction quite like the rise of \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Fox News can be a virtual kingmaker leading up to the primaries, providing candidates with a platform, firepower for their arguments -- including Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's long-held assertion, which he rejected only on Friday, that President Obama was not born in the United States -- and a large, receptive audience. But it also boxes in candidates with the narrow, cosseted views of its audience, making it almost impossible to reach out to more moderate Republicans during the general \uc2 election\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Now some conservative intellectuals, such as The Wall Street Journal's Bret Stephens and the Wisconsin radio talk show host Charlie Sykes and others, are asking whether Fox is a net plus or minus for their movement. They wonder what good it accomplishes when it leads to the nominations of Republicans like Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , who have a low chance of winning a general \uc2 election\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 A year ago, I tried to describe the Fox News effect in an academic paper. Fox had become so influential among conservatives that many refused to believe any news or opinion that wasn't vetted by the network (an effect I called ''self-brainwashing''). Those who inhabit this world live in a kind of bubble sometimes called ''epistemic closure,'' where they won't believe many things taken for granted by people who get news from other sources.\par \par \uc2 As a result, Fox News viewers score low on general news knowledge, lower even than people who consume no news, on questions like whether the stimulus caused job losses or whether President Obama was born in the United States. Fox News viewers are more likely than Republicans over all to believe that the United States found weapons of mass destruction in Iraq, or that discrimination against white people is as bad as discrimination against minorities.\par \par \uc2 When it began in 1996, Fox News did not advertise itself as conservative, but rather as being in the center. I, like many conservatives, thought the mainstream media was liberal, so being in the center meant Fox was relatively to the right of most media.\par \par \uc2 But after the terrorist attacks on Sept. 11, 2001, Fox began shifting to the right of center, creating, along with talk radio and conservative websites, an ideological cocoon for viewers. One result is that crazy ideas and conspiracy theories can circulate without any correction or resistance. Fox tends to normalize such notions, because guests espousing them are treated as part of the conservative mainstream and are almost never contradicted by a liberal voice or one of the Fox anchors.\par \par \uc2 The sealed universe of Fox News might be an excellent strategy for a niche television audience, but it's a disastrous one for presidential candidates who have to appeal to swing voters. Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  continues to double down on his most outrageous opinions and proposals, like the Mexican wall, cutting his campaign off from the support of moderate Republicans, undecided voters and disaffected Democrats.\par \par \uc2 Ten years ago I stopped watching Fox because I found that it distorted my worldview, causing me to pay attention to issues that Fox emphasized at the expense of those that were objectively more important.\par \par \uc2 Since at least 1969, when Vice President Spiro T. Agnew gave a speech criticizing the national media, conservatives have believed that the media is overwhelmingly liberal and hostile to their values. I thought so myself for a long time, but no longer. I think it hews pretty much to the objective center, with Fox well to the right.\par \par \uc2 Could Fox News be that outlet that a broader coalition of conservatives wants? The recent ouster of Mr. Ailes and the inevitable takeover of the company by the sons of 85-year-old \uc2 Rupert Murdoch\uc2  mean that some change will come. Opening Fox to broader political views could be a plus for both it and the conservative movement. If Fox News remains an entrenched part of the conservative extreme, the result will be more Republican candidates like Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  and more defeats at the polls.\par \par \uc2 Follow The \uc2 New York Times\uc2  Opinion section on \uc2 Facebook\uc2  and \uc2 Twitter\uc2  (@NYTopinion), and sign up for the Opinion Today newsletter.\par \par \uc2 Bruce Bartlett served in senior policy roles in the Ronald Reagan and George H.W.

There is no evidence \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  and her campaign either started or took part in the efforts to question the location of \uc2 Barack Obama\uc2 's birth.\par \par \uc2 He continued: ''I finished it.''\par \par \uc2 That was also a lie. Well after it had been established that the president was born in this country, \uc2 Trump\uc2  continued to traffic in speculation to the contrary, all the way up to and including this year.\par \par \uc2 Then \uc2 Trump\uc2  said, without elaboration or allowing questions: ''President \uc2 Barack Obama\uc2  was born in the United States. Period.''\par \par \uc2 Trump\uc2  has a long history of elevating the idiocy of conspiracy theories and normalizing the nonsensical.\par \par \uc2 Trump\uc2  has claimed that Bill Ayers wrote the President's acclaimed, best-selling memoir because surely this black man couldn't have the talent to write the book. As \uc2 Trump\uc2  put it:\par \par \uc2 ''I think somebody else had a lot to do with that book. I think he wrote the second book, which was certainly not a masterpiece. I'm very good at books, and it certainly wasn't a masterpiece.''\par \par \uc2 It should be noted that \uc2 Trump\uc2 's own best seller, ''The Art of the Deal,'' was ghostwritten by Tony Schwartz, who told \uc2 The New Yorker\uc2  in July, ''I seriously doubt that \uc2 Trump\uc2  has ever read a book straight through in his adult life.''\par \par \uc2 Trump\uc2  claimed in a 2011 interview with Sean Hannity that President Obama was ''born Barry Soetoro, somewhere along the line, he changed his name.'' Soetoro is the surname of Obama's mother's second husband, who she married when Obama was a young boy.\par \par \uc2 But \uc2 Trump\uc2  didn't stop there. He strung together more conspiracy theories, including coming back to his obvious envy of the success and quality of Obama's first book:\par \par \uc2 ''I heard he had terrible marks and he ends up in Harvard. He wrote a book that was better than Ernest Hemingway, but his second book was written by an average person. He shouldn't have written the second book.''\par \par \uc2 Speaking of college, \uc2 Trump\uc2  has insinuated that Obama never attended \uc2 Columbia University\uc2 . In 2011, \uc2 Trump\uc2  told the Conservative Political Action Conference that ''our current president came out of nowhere'' and ''In fact, I'll go a step further: The people that went to school with him, they never saw him, they don't know who he is. It's crazy.''\par \par \uc2 The fact-checking site PolitiFact rated this lie ''Pants on Fire.''\par \par \uc2 He once suggested to Fox News's Bill O'Reilly that maybe Obama hadn't produced a birth certificate because it could reveal that he's a secret Muslim. He said:\par \par \uc2 ''People have birth certificates. He doesn't have a birth certificate. He may have one but there's something on that, maybe religion, maybe it says he is a Muslim. I don't know. Maybe he doesn't want that.''\par \par \uc2 Indeed, the list of conspiracy theories \uc2 Trump\uc2  has floated about President Obama is long, but Obama has not been the only target. \uc2 Trump\uc2  has also entertained the suspicion that Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia was murdered, just as he suggests Vince Foster was. He has also intimated that Ted Cruz's father was involved in the assassination of President John F. Kennedy.\par \par \uc2 This is what \uc2 Trump\uc2  does: He exalts gossip and innuendo, which has the direct and opposite effect of degrading truth and honesty. He finds a lie in which the depraved have faith and he lifts it up as if it's a secret that their opponents fear.\par \par \uc2 This is an enormous distraction, because it means that time and attention that could be put into exposing that \uc2 Trump\uc2 's policies are either paper thin or laughably unworkable are instead diverted to disproving lies which usher forth from his mouth like water from a hose at full throttle.\par \par \uc2 And even when confronted with proof positive that his conspiracies are baseless, he often doesn't back down, or if he does, he does so without apology.\par \par \uc2 He is not only bending the truth, he is breaking the notion that truth should matter in the first place.\par \par \uc2 This is what is so baffling about the people supporting him: They know he's lying, but they so want to believe the lies that they have pushed themselves into a universe of irrationality that is devoid of logic.\par \par \uc2 So, his admission on Friday was too little, too late; too contrived, too strategic and too lacking in context. In fact, \uc2 Trump\uc2  has peddled so many lies about the president that this clearly \uc2 election\uc2 -driven, down-to-the-wire political ploy rang hollow and felt like as much of an insult as the original claim.\par \par \uc2 No one who so proudly wears the mark of dishonesty and defamation possesses the power to grant the stamps of legitimacy and absolution.\par \par \uc2 I invite you to join me on \uc2 Facebook\uc2  and follow me on Twitter (@CharlesMBlow), or email me at chblow@nytimes.com.\par \par \uc2 Follow The \uc2 New York Times\uc2  Opinion section on \uc2 Facebook\uc2  and Twitter (@NYTopinion), and sign up for the Opinion Today newsletter.\par \par \uc2 CHART: The Seeds of Doubt (Source: Huffington Post/YouGov poll conducted Jan 9-11, 2016.) \par \par \uc2 Document NYTF000020160919ec9j0003b\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw272\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4080\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 Defenders of Republican nominee \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2 , who took five years to concede President \uc2 Barack Obama\uc2  was born in the U.S., tried on Sunday to shift the focus to the campaign of Democratic nominee \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 On Friday, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  stood down from years of false accusations that made him a central figure in the discredited "birther" movement. But he blamed Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  for suggesting in the 2008 Democratic primary campaign that Mr. Obama, a Hawaii native, was born overseas -- an allegation the \uc2 Clinton\uc2  campaign said is false.\par \par \uc2 "Associates of the \uc2 Clinton\uc2  campaign started this birtherism question in 2007," said \uc2 Trump\uc2  campaign manager Kellyanne Conway on \uc2 NBC\uc2 . Added Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's running mate, \uc2 Mike Pence\uc2 , on ABC: "Other than many in the national media, and certainly in \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's campaign . . . the American people aren't focused on the debates of the past."\par \par \uc2 A former Washington bureau chief of McClatchy said Sidney Blumenthal, a confidant of Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , had shared the claims during Mr. Obama's first campaign for president, prompting McClatchy to assign a reporter to investigate. But Mr. Blumenthal told the \uc2 Boston Globe\uc2  Friday: "This is false. Period."\par \par \uc2 On Sunday, Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's running mate, Virginia Senator Tim Kaine, said on \uc2 CNN\uc2  he had no reason to believe the Blumenthal story was true. And on Fox News, he asked Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 : "Why were you trying to whip up the darkest emotions connected to the most painful chapter in American life?"\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=wjco20160919000097"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document J000000020160919ec9j0002e\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw272\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4080\pichgoal600

Lee   \par \uc2 763 \uc2 words\par \uc2 19 September 2016\par \uc2 The Wall Street Journal\par \uc2 J\par A4\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 WASHINGTON, Pa. -- \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  isn't banking on winning pockets of Pennsylvania and Ohio packed with the sort of white, working class voters flocking to Republican \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2 . She just wants to avoida wipeout.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's path to victory in these battleground states hinges on running up overwhelming margins in largely white counties, neutralizing Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's advantage among minority and college-educated voters clustered in the cities and suburbs.\par \par \uc2 With polls showing the race tightening in these states, Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  is deploying two allies to try to cut into Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's numbers: her husband and Vice President \uc2 Joe Biden\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 Clinton\uc2  campaign reckons that if anyone can make inroads with blue collar voters unhappy about their prospects and cool to Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , it is these two, who came from hardscrabble backgrounds that give them a natural cultural and economic affinity to this slice of the electorate.\par \par \uc2 One of their prime targets is Pennsylvania. The state is emerging as a firewall for her campaign in blocking Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  from reaching the 270 electoral votes needed to win the White House. If he loses Pennsylvania and its 20 electoral votes, he faces daunting odds in clearing the threshold, analysts say.\par \par \uc2 "Where's the tipping-point state -- the state that would put \uc2 Trump\uc2  over 270? I think you can make a stronger case for Pennsylvania than for any other state," said \uc2 Charlie Cook\uc2 , editor and publisher of the Cook Political Report.\par \par \uc2 Democrats haven't lost Pennsylvania since 1988, and polls show Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  leads here, but she has been losing ground.\par \par \uc2 A Real Clear Politics average of polling in the state shows she is ahead by nearly seven points, down from nine points for much of last month.\par \par \uc2 Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's campaign wouldn't say how well she would like to do among the state's white, working class voters, but one benchmark is the 2012 presidential race. That year, Mr. Obama won Pennsylvania by carrying 42% of this constituency, compared with 56% for Republican nominee \uc2 Mitt Romney\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Democrats say Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  didn't help herself when she made a comment in March that her energy policies were"going to put a lot of coal miners and coal companies out ofbusiness."She later said she was "mistaken in my remarks."\par \par \uc2 Jim Davis, chairman of the Democratic Party in Fayette County, near the West Virginia border, said Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's comments stung. "It resonates here and \uc2 Trump\uc2  has capitalized on it," he said. "She's hurt herself in Pennsylvania."\par \par \uc2 Mr. Davis was among the customers and Democratic officials who greeted Mr. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  when the former president recently stopped at an Italian restaurant. It was one of two stops Mr. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  made in a pair of southwestern Pennsylvania counties won by the Republicans in 2008 and 2012.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  offered folksy stories about using outhouses in rural Arkansas, trying to forge connections to voters who might be sympathetic to Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 "I know where I am," he told a group of his wife's supporters in a campaign office in Washington, Pa., part of a county that is virtually all white. "You know a lot of people who are voting for \uc2 Trump\uc2 , don't you?. . .I'm a white, Southern, Scotch-Irish Protestant, right? A poster child for Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's base."\par \par \uc2 He made the case that people unhappy about their lives shouldn't look to Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  for solutions.\par \par \uc2 "So I can understand why there's a lot of road rage out there," he said. "But Hillary's running a campaign on answers, not anger; on responsibility, not resentment; on empowerment, not rage."\par \par \uc2 Trump\uc2  aides, in reply, cast Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  as an advocate of free-trade deals they say have hurt everyday families.\par \par \uc2 "She is a globalist, and we look forward to fully exposing her disastrous agenda," said Stephen Miller, a senior policy adviser for the \uc2 Trump\uc2  campaign.\par \par \uc2 In his campaign stops, Mr. Biden often points to the financial strains his family faced when he was growing up in Scranton, Pa.\par \par \uc2 He describes the Republican nominee as someone who relishes handing out pink slips, invoking the signature phrase from Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's former TV show: "You're fired."\par \par \uc2 Mentioning Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's comments on coal, state \uc2 Rep. Tim Mahoney\uc2 , a Democrat, said he welcomed a visit from her husband. "But if she comes it probably would help a lot better," he said. "She's the one who said what she said."\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=wjco20160919000090"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document J000000020160919ec9j00027\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

Stay in and Watch TV\b0\par\par\uc2 By MIKE HALE \par \uc2 3,609 \uc2 words\par \uc2 18 September 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 116\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 The peak-TV bubble shows no signs of bursting: For this preview, we considered more than 125 scripted programs, new and old, that will have their premieres by the end of the year. Most of the new ones are listed here, along with a few of the more prominent returnees. The buzziest shows? They're on \uc2 Netflix\uc2  (''Black Mirror,'' ''Easy'') and Amazon (''Transparent,'' ''Crisis in Six Scenes''), as we've quickly come to expect.\par \par \uc2 Dates are subject to change.\par \par \uc2 September(CBS\par \par \uc2 THE BIG BANG THEORY (\uc2 CBS\uc2 , Sept. 19) TV's highest-rated sitcom begins its 10th season by adding Katey Sagal and Jack McBrayer as the mother and brother of Kaley Cuoco's Penny.\par \par \uc2 KEVIN CAN WAIT (\uc2 CBS\uc2 , Sept. 19) Kevin James (''The King of Queens'') couldn't wait to headline another sitcom in which he plays a New York public servant (a cop this time) with a counterintuitively attractive wife (Erinn James).\par \par \uc2 THE GOOD PLACE (\uc2 NBC\uc2 , Sept. 19) A woman (Kristen Bell) wakes up in heaven, which looks like a cross between a \uc2 Disney\uc2  theme park, a planned community and a politically correct college campus, and realizes she's not supposed to be there. Ted Danson stars as her bow-tied angel in this satire from Michael Schur, a producer on ''\uc2 Parks and Recreation\uc2 '' and ''Master of None.''\par \par \uc2 BULL (\uc2 CBS\uc2 , Sept. 20) Phil McGraw (a.k.a. Dr. Phil) should be flattered that he's being played in this new drama (based on his early days as a psychologist and legal consultant) by Michael Weatherly, who is coming off 13 seasons as the hunky Tony DiNozzo on ''NCIS.''\par \par \uc2 NCIS (\uc2 CBS\uc2 , Sept. 20) The perennially popular naval detectives have dropped more than four million viewers from their peak, but they return for their 14th season with a two-season renewal. The original cast member Michael Weatherly has left, while Jennifer Esposito and Wilmer Valderrama have signed on.\par \par \uc2 THIS IS US (\uc2 NBC\uc2 , Sept. 20) Dan Fogelman, whose record is spotty but interesting (''Galavant,'' the screenplay of ''Crazy, Stupid, Love''), created this connected-lives-of-complete-strangers series. The gimmick: They all have the same birthday, so the Hallmark vibe of the pilot kind of makes sense.\par \par \uc2 BLACK-ISH (ABC, Sept. 21) ABC's African-American family comedy could start its third season on quite a high note: three days before its premiere, it will compete for best comedy series and best actor in a comedy (Anthony Anderson) at the Emmys.\par \par \uc2 DESIGNATED SURVIVOR (ABC, Sept. 21) Kiefer Sutherland's new show moves even faster than ''24'': In the first episode, the entire White House administration is wiped out except for the secretary of Housing and Urban Development (Mr. Sutherland), who becomes president. With Maggie Q and Kal Penn.\par \par \uc2 EMPIRE (Fox, Sept. 21) Lee Daniels's lavishly melodramatic hip-hop soap opera, a ratings dynamo in its first season, was down significantly in its second but still near the top of the charts. Mariah Carey and the rappers French Montana and Birdman will make appearances in Season 3.\par \par \uc2 LETHAL WEAPON (Fox, Sept. 21) This remake of the 1987 buddy-cop film stars Clayne Crawford (''Rectify'') as a down-home version of Mel Gibson's possibly suicidal wack job and Damon Wayans as a more broadly comic version of Danny Glover's nervous family man.\par \par \uc2 SPEECHLESS (ABC, Sept. 21) Minnie Driver stars as the overbearing matriarch of a sitcom family that stands out for many reasons, not the least of which is the youngest child (Micah Fowler), who has cerebral palsy and doesn't speak. It's a little like a comic version of Ms. Driver's previous series, ''The Riches,'' but a little more like the British show ''Raised by Wolves.''\par \par \uc2 EASY (\uc2 Netflix\uc2 , Sept. 22) The indie director Joe Swanberg attracted an interesting cast for his loosely interwoven, eight-episode anthology about love and sex in contemporary Chicago, including Gugu Mbatha-Raw, Raul Castillo, Malin Akerman, Orlando Bloom, Hannibal Buress and Jane Adams.\par \par \uc2 NOTORIOUS (ABC, Sept. 22) Piper Perabo and Daniel Sunjata play a television news producer and a high-profile criminal lawyer with a mutually beneficial relationship, roles based on the ''Larry King Live'' producer Wendy Walker and the lawyer Mark Geragos, who benefited from the Scott Peterson case. (They're also benefiting as executive producers of the show.)\par \par \uc2 PITCH (Fox, Sept. 22) There is crying in baseball in this inspirational, sentimental drama about the first female player in the major leagues (Kylie Bunbury of ''Twisted'').\par \par \uc2 LONGMIRE (\uc2 Netflix\uc2 , Sept. 23) Give Netflix credit for keeping this old-fashioned modern western alive. It's not a revolutionary show, but it is among the few series that live up to the description ''character-driven.'' Fan service: In the Season 5 premiere, Vic (Katee Sackhoff) helps a wounded Walt (Robert Taylor) change his pants.\par \par \uc2 MacGYVER (\uc2 CBS\uc2 , Sept. 23) The handyman of action heroes returns in a reboot of the ABC series (1985-1992), this time played by Lucas Till (Havok in the ''X-Men'' movies). In the spirit of tinkering, \uc2 CBS\uc2  scrapped the first pilot and reshot it.\par \par \uc2 THE EXORCIST (Fox, Sept. 23) ''Demons aren't real,'' says the young priest (Alfonso Herrera). So why is that raven trying to fly through the window? And what about the hounds! Ben Daniels also stars, as the obsessive older priest, in a series based on the 1973 film.\par \par \uc2 TRANSPARENT (Amazon, Sept. 23) The long-running gender transition of Maura Pfefferman (Jeffrey Tambor) enters its third season, with Maura seriously contemplating surgery.\par \par \uc2 VAN HELSING (Syfy, Sept. 23) Van stands for Vanessa (Kelly Overton), a descendant of vampire hunters who carries on the family business in a world dominated by -- you guessed it.\par \par \uc2 BOB'S BURGERS (Fox, Sept. 25) Like the swallows to Capistrano, it's the annual return of Fox's mostly-animated Sunday comedy lineup, including this warmly anarchic favorite, in its seventh season, and Season 28 of ''The Simpsons.''\par \par \uc2 SIXTY MINUTES (\uc2 CBS\uc2 , Sept. 25) The hoary newsmagazine begins its 49th season. One more year, and it will be in the same advertising demographic as most of its viewers.\par \par \uc2 CHANNEL ZERO (Syfy, Sept. 27) An anthology series in the style of ''American Horror Story,'' this new show will base its season-long stories on the Internet-generated scary stories known as creepypasta.\par \par \uc2 THE CHOICE 2016 (\uc2 PBS\uc2 , Sept. 27) This two-hour ''Frontline'' report from the veteran producer Michael Kirk, profiling \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  and \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , will probably be the most serious reporting on the presidential \uc2 election\uc2  that you'll find on television this fall.\par \par \uc2 CRISIS IN SIX SCENES (Amazon, Sept. 30) Not a lot is known about Woody Allen's first series, a six-episode, stand-alone story. According to Amazon, it's set in the 1960s and is about a suburban family and its house guest. From the trailer, we know Mr. Allen plays a novelist, but we don't know if he's the guest.\par \par \uc2 MARVEL'S LUKE CAGE (\uc2 Netflix\uc2 , Sept. 30) Next up in the Marvel-Netflix universe: Mike Colter (''The Good Wife'') as the somewhat indestructible Luke Cage, a character first introduced last year in ''Marvel's Jessica Jones.'' Rosario Dawson's Claire Temple, the nurse from ''Daredevil,'' also crosses over into the new show.\par \par \uc2 October\par \par \uc2 VERSAILLES (Ovation, Oct. 1) Louis XIV builds Versailles in this European-Canadian production. Constructing the palace is a political ploy on the young king's part, but its many rooms also provide gilded backdrops for plenty of sex.\par \par \uc2 ASH VS. EVIL DEAD (Starz, Oct. 2) Bruce Campbell returns for a second season of comic mayhem and chainsaws.\par \par \uc2 ELEMENTARY (\uc2 CBS\uc2 , Oct. 2) The most consistently intelligent and well-acted of the broadcast network crime dramas, with Jonny Lee Miller as Sherlock Holmes and Lucy Liu as his Watson, returns for Season 5.\par \par \uc2 WESTWORLD (\uc2 HBO\uc2 , Oct. 2) A reboot of the 1973 sci-fi film about a very adult amusement park -- where androids are a supposedly safe means for getting kicks -- is \uc2 HBO\uc2 's latest attempt to get back on top in the prestige-drama field. But it will have to overcome the cloud of a long, troubled production and questions regarding depictions of sexual violence.\par \par \uc2 TIMELESS (\uc2 NBC\uc2 , Oct. 3) An archcriminal (Goran Visnjic) steals a time machine to change the course of history, and not in a good way. A team is sent back to find him, providing weekly adventures and pocket history lessons. From two showrunners with a good track record, Eric Kripke (''Supernatural'') and Shawn Ryan (''The Shield'').\par \par \uc2 CONVICTION (ABC, Oct. 3) Hayley Atwell (''Agent Carter'') is a wild-child former first daughter and star lawyer leading a team whose unenviable job is to ferret out wrongful convictions. The pilot breaks all speed records for putting legal-drama formulas in place, getting on with its first case within five minutes.\par \par \uc2 NO TOMORROW (CW, Oct. 4) More heartfelt, gently satirical fantasy-dramedy from CW (and, like ''Jane the Virgin,'' another adaptation of a Latin-American series). A woman with a boring job at an Amazonesque retailer meets her dream guy, but there's a catch -- he's expecting the world to end in less than a year.\par \par \uc2 FREQUENCY (CW, Oct. 5) Of the fall's rash of remakes of old films, this one looks back the shortest distance, to the 2000 fantasy police thriller about a son talking to his dead father via enchanted ham radio. This time it's a daughter, as Peyton List (Roger Sterling's second wife, Jane, in ''Mad Men'') takes the role originally played by Jim Caviezel.\par \par \uc2 DIVORCE (\uc2 HBO\uc2 , Oct. 9) Sarah Jessica Parker, who developed and stars in this melancholy half-hour comedy about a woman trying to start over, has been clear that it's not a follow-up to ''Sex and the City.'' Helping to ensure the difference is her recruitment of the acerbic Sharon Horgan (''Catastrophe,'' ''Pulling'') to create the show and write the pilot.\par \par \uc2 INSECURE (\uc2 HBO\uc2 , Oct. 9) Larry Wilmore, whose tenure as host of ''The Nightly Show'' abruptly ended last month, is a creator of this comedy series about two black women navigating life, love and friendship in Los Angeles. The real news, though, is the other creator (and the show's star): Issa Rae, the \uc2 YouTube\uc2  idol and author of ''The Misadventures of Awkward Black Girl.''\par \par \uc2 FREAKISH (\uc2 Hulu\uc2 , Oct. 10) From the teen-drama purveyors at \uc2 AwesomenessTV\uc2 , a small-town zombie-ish-apocalypse story: high school students emerge from a disaster drill to discover that their town's chemical plant has exploded and mutant freaks are at large.\par \par \uc2 SUPERGIRL (CW, Oct. 10) Moving from \uc2 CBS\uc2  to CW for its second season, the show adds Lynda Carter, one-time Wonder Woman, as the president of the United States and Tyler Hoechlin (''Teen Wolf'') as Supergirl's Kryptonian cousin, Superman.\par \par \uc2 VICE NEWS TONIGHT (\uc2 HBO\uc2 , Oct. 10) \uc2 Vice Media\uc2  continues its expansion into TV with this weeknight, 7:30 p.m. show that promises ''a flexible and diverse approach to reporting the nightly news,'' which means, at least, no desk and no anchors.\par \par \uc2 AMERICAN HOUSEWIFE (ABC, Oct. 11) Originally titled ''The Second Fattest Housewife in Westport,'' it's ''The Middle'' moved to Connecticut and a step up the economic ladder. There's a smart, funny mom (Katy Mixon) made insecure by the town's skinny stay-at-homes; a well-meaning dad; and an eccentric youngest child.\par \par \uc2 FRESH OFF THE BOAT (ABC, Oct. 11) Having weathered the public disenchantment of Eddie Huang, on whose memoir it's based, and the sometimes controversial comments about race, gender and casting of its breakout star, Constance Wu, this sitcom about a Taiwanese-American family embarks on its third season.\par \par \uc2 FALLING WATER (USA, Oct. 13) The legacy of the writer Henry Bromell (''I'll Fly Away,'' ''Homicide: Life on the Street,'' ''Homeland'') continues to grow three years after his death: he wrote (with Blake Masters) the pilot for this thriller about three people who realize they're having different parts of the same dream.\par \par \uc2 GOLIATH (Amazon, Oct. 14) Quick -- name the five shows David E. Kelley has had picked up since ''Boston Legal'' ended in 2008. Didn't think you could. (Only one, ''Harry's Law,'' lasted more than a season.) Now he's trying his luck online with an eight-episode drama about a trial matching an underdog lawyer (Billy Bob Thornton) and a partner from a white-shoe firm (William Hurt). The trailer has a noirish tone not typical of Mr. Kelley's TV work.\par \par \uc2 HATERS BACK OFF (\uc2 Netflix\uc2 , Oct. 14) Colleen Ballinger's \uc2 YouTube\uc2  alter ego, the untalented entertainer Miranda Sings -- whose views reach eight figures -- moves from the two-minute video world to the half-hour series world, adding scripts and other characters.\par \par \uc2 WOLF CREEK (Pop, Oct. 14) The lowest-profile of the season's movie-to-TV transfers, this adaptation of a series of Australian films is one of the more vivid and viscerally satisfying of the bunch. Lucy Fry (''Alien Surf Girls'') plays the American teenager determined to find the serial killer who murdered her family in the outback.\par \par \uc2 BERLIN STATION (Epix, Oct. 16) This 10-episode spy thriller -- Epix's first big bid to take on its better-known premium-cable rivals -- has a promising cast. The excellent Richard Jenkins plays the C.I.A. station chief in Berlin and is joined by Michelle Forbes, Richard Armitage, Rhys Ifans and Tamlyn Tomita.\par \par \uc2 EYEWITNESS (USA, Oct. 16) In the latest Nordic-noir adaptation (based on a Norwegian series), a murder investigation is followed through a 10-episode season from the perspective of two teenage witnesses. Julianne Nicholson plays a sheriff.\par \par \uc2 GRAVES (Epix, Oct. 16) Nick Nolte takes on television comedy for the first time, starring in this half-hour satire as a former United States president who decides he has to atone for the mistakes he made while in office. The timing of his guilt trip is inconvenient for his wife (Sela Ward), who's running for the Senate.\par \par \uc2 CHANCE (\uc2 Hulu\uc2 , Oct. 19) In his first headlining series role since ''House,'' Hugh Laurie plays another brilliant doctor, this time a San Francisco psychiatrist who gets embroiled in a noir-thriller scenario involving a femme-fatale patient and her husband, a detective.\par \par \uc2 THE ROCKY HORROR PICTURE SHOW: LET'S DO THE TIME WARP AGAIN (Fox, Oct. 20) A jump to the left, a jump to the right, a jump 41 years into the past. Fox's nostalgia binge (''Lethal Weapon,'' ''The Exorcist'') continues with this two-hour remake of the cult favorite ''The Rocky Horror Picture Show,'' starring Laverne Cox as Frank-N-Furter. (The original Frank, Tim Curry, narrates.)\par \par \uc2 BLACK MIRROR (\uc2 Netflix\uc2 , Oct. 21) The buzz around the British writer Charlie Brooker's ''Twilight Zone''-ish anthology has been in inverse proportion to its footprint: seven episodes across three years, none seen by more than two million viewers in initial broadcasts. That should change now that \uc2 Netflix\uc2  has commissioned a six-episode third season.\par \par \uc2 CRAZY EX-GIRLFRIEND (CW, Oct. 21) Rachel and Josh (Rachel Bloom and Vincent Rodriguez III) finally got together at the end of Season 1, but don't hold your breath -- this storybook series is all about finding ways to postpone the storybook ending.\par \par \uc2 DIRK GENTLY'S HOLISTIC DETECTIVE AGENCY (\uc2 BBC America\uc2 , Oct. 22) Max Landis, the screenwriter of ''Victor Frankenstein'' and ''American Ultra,'' created this latest adaptation of Douglas Adams's novels about a time-traveling detective (Samuel Barnett of ''The History Boys'').\par \par \uc2 THE WALKING DEAD (AMC, Oct. 23) Television's highest-rated drama (in the 18-to-49 demographic) returns for Season 7. This being ''The Walking Dead,'' we're waiting to see who was being beaten with a baseball bat at the end of Season 6.\par \par \uc2 MAN WITH A PLAN (\uc2 CBS\uc2 , Oct. 24) As ''Episodes'' approaches its final season, Matt LeBlanc returns to the broadcast-network, laugh-track sitcom fold, playing a contractor who has to take over parenting duties when his wife (Liza Snyder) gets a job.\par \par \uc2 RECTIFY (SundanceTV, Oct. 26) The setting shifts from rural Georgia to Nashville in the fourth and final season of this critically esteemed series about the life of a former death-row inmate.\par \par \uc2 THE GREAT INDOORS (\uc2 CBS\uc2 , Oct. 27) Joel McHale plays a lamestream journalist (a star writer for an outdoors magazine) adjusting to the digital future and the young podcasters and listicle-makers who embody it. It's either meta or melancholy that the show built around that premise is an entirely traditional sitcom.\par \par \uc2 PURE GENIUS (\uc2 CBS\uc2 , Oct. 27) In the genre of ''tech billionaire teams with maverick doctor'' -- hey, there was ''Proof'' -- this medical drama promises weekly miracles. Starring August Prew and Dermot Mulroney, it's the first hospital-set series for the executive producer Jason Katims (''Parenthood,'' ''Friday Night Lights'').\par \par \uc2 GOOD GIRLS REVOLT (Amazon, Oct. 28) James Poniewozik of The \uc2 New York Times\uc2 , reviewing the pilot last year, wrote that '''Mad Women' would have done nicely'' as a title for this eight-episode series, set in 1969 and based on \uc2 Lynn Povich\uc2 's book about a sex-discrimination suit brought by 46 female staff members against \uc2 Newsweek\uc2  magazine.\par \par \uc2 TRACEY ULLMAN'S SHOW (\uc2 HBO\uc2 , Oct. 28) A quarter-century after ''The Tracey Ullman Show'' on Fox, Ms. Ullman returns to her sketch-comedy roots in this similarly titled series, a \uc2 BBC\uc2  production whose staff includes several writers from \uc2 HBO\uc2 's ''Veep.''\par \par \uc2 PEOPLE OF EARTH (\uc2 TBS\uc2 , Oct. 31) Sci-fi comedy is an underrepresented category, and this series from the first-time writer-producer David Jenkins has a funny trailer. Wyatt Cenac plays a journalist investigating a support group for people who have been abducted by aliens.\par \par \uc2 STAN AGAINST EVIL (IFC, Oct. 31) It's sort of like ''Sleepy Hollow,'' except it's a comedy. John C. McGinley and Janet Varney play the former and current sheriffs of a New England town with a demon problem.\par \par \uc2 November\par \par \uc2 THE CROWN (\uc2 Netflix\uc2 , Nov. 4) Is it really Queen Elizabeth II if she isn't played by Helen Mirren? Claire Foy plays the 25-year-old, newly crowned queen, at least in the 10-episode first season of this biographical drama, written by Peter Morgan based on his play ''The Audience.'' Matt Smith (''Doctor Who'') is a dashing young Prince Philip, and John Lithgow is the aging Winston Churchill.\par \par \uc2 CLOSE TO THE ENEMY (AcornTV, Nov. 14) Cold War dramas are as plentiful these days as fake pieces of the Berlin Wall. This \uc2 BBC\uc2  mini-series centered on the development of the jet engine has the distinction of being written by the esteemed (in Britain) Stephen Poliakoff (''Gideon's Daughter,'' ''Perfect Strangers'').\par \par \uc2 GOOD BEHAVIOR (TNT, Nov. 15) Michelle Dockery's new role is a long way from Lady Mary on ''Downton Abbey'' -- or is it? She plays a con artist, just out of prison, who tries to prevent a hit man from carrying out his job. Still meddling! (The 10-episode series is based on novellas by Blake Crouch, who also wrote the ''Wayward Pines'' books.)\par \par \uc2 UNDERCOVER (\uc2 BBC America\uc2 , Nov. 17) Peter Moffat, who wrote ''Criminal Justice,'' on which \uc2 HBO\uc2 's ''The Night Of'' was based, is the author of this six-part drama about a British lawyer (Sophie Okonedo) defending a death-row inmate (Dennis Haysbert).\par \par \uc2 THE AFFAIR (Showtime, Nov. 20) Season 3 of this weirdly addictive soap opera/erotic thriller/murder mystery/legal drama picks up three years after Season 2's end, but it is sure to jump around in time willy-nilly. The French actress Ir\u232\'00\'E8ne Jacob joins the cast as yet another woman for Noah (Dominic West) to slobber over and will become the fifth character in the story's point-of-view rotation.\par \par \uc2 SEARCH PARTY (\uc2 TBS\uc2 , Nov. 21) \uc2 TBS\uc2  goes dark and postmodern (for \uc2 TBS\uc2 ) with this 10-episode comedy, shown on five consecutive nights, about the search for a missing woman. Alia Shawkat of ''Arrested Development'' stars.\par \par \uc2 GILMORE GIRLS: A YEAR IN THE LIFE (\uc2 Netflix\uc2 , Nov. 25) Apparently no one ever leaves Stars Hollow: practically the entire ''Gilmore Girls'' cast (except, sadly, Edward Herrmann) returned for these four feature-length episodes, which will cover a year in the life of the fictional Connecticut town.\par \par \uc2 December\par \par \uc2 THE LEVEL (AcornTV, Dec. 5) From \uc2 ITV\uc2 , the mega-provider of British crime dramas, comes a six-part series about a detective (Karla Crome) with a secret connection to a crook (Philip Glenister).\par \par \uc2 MOZART IN THE JUNGLE (Amazon, Dec. 9) The classical-music comedy that was a surprise Golden Globe winner this year returns for its third season.\par \par \uc2 MAN IN THE HIGH CASTLE (Amazon, Dec. 16) In its second season, the series departs even further from the Philip K. Dick novel on which it's based, with, among many radical changes, Joe Blake (Luke Kleintank) alive and on a rocket to Berlin.\par \par \uc2 This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.\par \par \uc2 Above, Daniel Sunjata and Piper Perabo in the drama ''Notorious.''

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Two weeks after Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  accepted the Democratic presidential nomination in Philadelphia, beaming through a hail of gigantic balloons, her campaign's ''Latinos con Hillary'' program began in five cities in Virginia. One of the kickoff parties took place at Todos Supermarket in Prince William County, in a modest white room where about 40 people gathered around three tables draped in cheap blue cloth to hear a speech by \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's national Latino-vote director, Lorella Praeli. When she was 2, Praeli, now 28, lost one of her legs in a car accident, but with her crutches, she commanded the room more adroitly than any of the speakers who preceded her, moving among the tables as she rallied her troops. Though the party was advertised on \uc2 Facebook\uc2 , most of the men and women in attendance were seasoned Democratic politicians, staff members and volunteers.\par \par \uc2 ''I'm not here to make it pretty,'' Praeli said. ''The work ahead of us, the task and challenge ahead of us for the next what -- 96 days -- is huge.'' She ticked through the efforts needed to register and turn out Latinos: knocking on doors, hosting phone-bank parties, convincing friends, haunting markets, teaching Spanish-speakers the how and the when and the where of voting. In her speech, the job sounded herculean. Near the end of her pitch, she asked everyone to stand and feel the energy in the room while they said, in Spanish, ''We will be the difference.''\par \par \uc2 ''I want you to say it and to believe it,'' Praeli instructed. ''I want you to say it and to commit yourself.'' She smiled, but these were marching orders. ''If we don't believe it, other people won't believe,'' Praeli said in Spanish. ''If we don't believe it in this room, we won't be the difference in November.''\par \par \uc2 Latinos have been hearing that they will be the difference for decades. In Spanish-language media this year, the rhetoric around the \uc2 election\uc2  has often gone so far as to imply that Latinos will decide the result on their own. \uc2 Telemundo\uc2 's \uc2 election\uc2  coverage runs under the slogan ''Yo Decido,'' ''I Decide.'' The Univision news anchor Jorge Ramos told The Times last year that ''the new rule in American politics is that no one can make it to the White House without the Hispanic vote.''\par \par \uc2 It's true enough that 800,000 Latinos turn 18 every year, and both parties burn millions of dollars trying to woo Hispanic voters. This year, 27 million will be eligible to vote. But the idea of a fearsome Latino political power remains more myth than reality. Journalists have been writing about the so-called ''sleeping giant'' of Hispanic voters since at least the 1970s, but the fact is that voter turnout among Latinos remains dismal. It can run almost 20 percentage points lower than that of African-Americans and non-Hispanic whites. Exactly the same percentage of eligible Latinos, 48 percent, showed up for Romney versus Obama in 2012 as turned out for Bush versus Dukakis in 1988. While the raw number of Latino ballots cast has tripled since 1998, so has the number of Latino citizens who don't vote. Only once in the past 28 years, during the 1992 match among George H.W. Bush, \uc2 Bill \uc2 Clinton\uc2  and \uc2 Ross Perot\uc2  that spurred a jump in overall turnout, has Latino turnout exceeded 50 percent. More often than not, ''Yo Decido'' to stay home.\par \par \uc2 This year, the new spin on the old dream is that \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  will finally shake the giant awake. He opened his campaign last summer by calling Mexican immigrants ''rapists,'' has repeatedly proclaimed that he will build a wall between Mexico and the United States and, until recently, has made the deportation of 11 million undocumented immigrants a cornerstone of his platform. As early as September 2015, Javier Palomarez, the president and chief executive of the U.S. Hispanic Chamber of Commerce, told \uc2 Politico\uc2 : ''I think the greatest thing to ever happen to the Hispanic electorate is a gentleman named \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2 . He has crystallized the angst and anger of the Hispanic community.'' He added, ''I think we can all rest assured that Hispanics can turn out in record numbers.''\par \par \uc2 Perhaps. But achieving record turnout for a demographic with a lackluster voting history isn't so simple as watching them take themselves to the polls. In June, Mi Familia Vota and the \uc2 National Council of La Raza\uc2 , two nonprofit groups devoted to organizing Latinos, warned that they needed more cash to match their voter registration numbers from 2012. In July, the \uc2 Pew Research Center\uc2  noted that ''Hispanic voters lag all registered voters on several measures of engagement'' -- they aren't paying attention to \uc2 election\uc2  news as closely as other citizens and they aren't thinking about the \uc2 election\uc2  as much. At a conference on the Hispanic vote held in New York City in January, the big unanswered question was ''Why have Latinos never really turned out in force?''\par \par \uc2 Looking for answers, I spent six months interviewing scores of Latinos in Virginia, a battleground state where the Latino share of the population has more than tripled since 1990. I met with Latino Catholics, Pentecostals and Mormons, with legal residents, citizens and undocumented immigrants. I frequented a church and a community center, soccer fields and a dance club. I lurked around Republican and Democratic events and a skateboard park. I interviewed custodians and construction workers, lawyers and real estate agents, restaurant owners and community organizers, college students and political staffers. In all, I spoke with more than 100 Virginians of various ethnic backgrounds.\par \par \uc2 For all the energy that activists, especially on the Democratic side, have put into turning out the Latino vote, I met strikingly few Latinos outside the upper-middle class who talked about voting as if it were something they did regularly. The exceptions tended to be people like Luc\u237\'00\'EDa Rodriguez, 61, who cleans houses and has voted regularly for more than a decade -- even in 2008 after she and her husband, a custodian, saw all their savings vanish in the mortgage crisis. For years afterward, they scrambled to keep their family afloat, working every available hour. Yet she kept on voting. Why? ''It's a civic duty,'' she said. Rodriguez explained that in Bolivia, where she had been an accountant, she learned the habit of voting because nonvoters could be penalized with fines. In her Mormon church in the United States, she was surrounded by friends who voted. To pass her citizenship test, she had to study American government and learn English. Her voting behavior entailed years of effort and experience. Through all my conversations, I began to fear that the real roots of political engagement, which lie not in quadrennial outreach programs but around dinner tables and in churches and classrooms, are far more absent from Latino life in America than most people understand.\par \par \uc2 ''A person on the fence needs to be activated to turn into a voter,'' Marvin Figueroa, 30, said one humid Friday in July as he stood before a crowd of white-collar professionals at a ''Happy Hour for Hillary.'' These borderline voters, he said, often need ''13 touches'' -- calls, door knocks, texts, etc. -- before they would turn out. Figueroa is \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's political director for Virginia. His spreadsheets contain not only Latinos but also African-Americans, millennials and Muslims: any constituent group that might be pulled into a pro-\uc2 Clinton\uc2  coali\u173\'00\'ADtion. This evening, inside the Arlington home of a defense contractor who turned Democrat after the Tea Party swept into Congress in 2010, the audience was mostly female, mostly Caucasian and only marginally Latino. The doors to the screened-in porch were open; the air-conditioning was off; the margarita machine was on. The Spanish speakers blended into the crowd.\par \par \uc2 Statistically, the Latinos most likely to cast ballots are almost identical to other reliable American voters. They are over 40. They've lived in the United States for at least 20 years. They are Puerto Ricans and Cuban-Americans with long cultural histories of citizenship. They are college graduates.\par \par \uc2 The Latinos least likely to vote represent a different demographic slice altogether. They are under 30, single and Mexican-American. Their families earn less than $50,000 a year. They may not have completed high school.\par \par \uc2 Data capsules like these suggest that the Latino vote is simply hamstrung by the same factors that impede the \uc2 Election\uc2  Day turnout of all Americans: poverty, youth, lack of schooling. Political scientists showed long ago that voting goes hand in glove with affluence and education. Generally speaking, the wealthier you are, the more degrees you earn, the more likely you are to turn out. But if these were the only relevant factors, Latino voting would most likely rise naturally over time as more Latinos enrolled in college and as the age of the average American-born Latino increased. (In 2012 their average age was 18.)\par \par \uc2 Causality unravels, however, when you start picking at the numbers. Take income, for example. While nearly a quarter of Latinos live in poverty, as a group they are slightly better off than African-Americans. Yet in 2012, African-Americans had the highest turnout rates in the nation. They, not Latinos, have arguably been the decisive bloc in our last two presidential contests and in this year's Democratic primary. So poverty alone can't explain the weak Hispanic vote.\par \par \uc2 Youth and education also prove to be red herrings. Hispanics are America's youngest and least-educated major racial or ethnic group. Nearly a third of foreign-born Latinos never reached ninth grade. Some have never had a day of schooling in their lives. But if age and learning were the decisive catalysts, we would expect to find the highest voter turnout among Asian-Americans, who are our second-oldest and best-educated group. More than half of Asian-Americans hold bachelors degrees. Yet Asian-Americans tend to vote at even lower rates than Latinos. In 2012, 53 percent of their eligible voters did not go to the polls.\par \par \uc2 So what do Asians and Hispanics, two vastly different groups in terms of age, education and culture, have in common? It's obvious once you look for it: For the past 30 years, most of America's immigrants have arrived from Asia and Latin America. Both groups struggle with English. Roughly a third of Hispanic adults and a 10th of Hispanic children say that they cannot speak English ''very well.'' Among Asians, the numbers are similar.\par \par \uc2 The American political system once efficiently trained immigrants in how to pull electoral levers. For all their flaws, urban political machines like Tammany Hall did an extraordinary job of recruiting poor, undereducated Irish and Italian immigrants, then shepherding their political incorporation into local and national affairs. But immigrants from Latin America and Asia were largely excluded from the old machines, both by laws limiting their naturalization and enfranchisement and by racism. The Voting Rights Act of 1965 was not extended to Hispanics and Asians until 1975. By then most of the urban machines had been dismantled, and the leading edge of our current wave of Asian and Hispanic immigrants began unpacking their bags in Los Angeles, San Francisco, New York, Atlanta and Washington.\par \par \uc2 The immigrants from Latin America immediately found themselves lumped together under the label ''Hispanic,'' even if they spoke Portuguese or an indigenous language, even if they had no ancestral link to Spain. It's tough to galvanize such a heterogeneous group. The panethnic, multilingual category of ''Hispanic'' is a uniquely American invention, created by congressional legislation in the 1970s. In her book ''Making Hispanics,'' G. Cristina Mora shows how bureaucrats, media executives and political activists built the notion to combine Mexican-Americans, Cuban-Americans, Puerto Ricans and others in census counts and federal programs. The term was always deliberately ambiguous, Mora notes, so that it could accommodate varied origin stories. There are Hispanics who swam the Rio Grande hoping for a living wage, Hispanics who flew business class to enroll in Ivy League schools, Hispanics who disembarked as Cold Warriors in Florida. There are even Hispanics whose families owned land in the Southwest before it was ever part of the United States. (These ''Hispanics'' like to joke that they didn't cross the border; the border crossed them.) Unlike African-Americans, most of whom can trace a connection to slavery, Latinos have no single common history. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , Figueroa once told me, ''makes us more Latino'': His threats and insults provoke a unifying sense of indignation.\par \par \uc2 Sifting thorough the numbers and this complicated history makes the 52 percent of nonvoting Latinos look rather different. The problem isn't their youth, poverty or lack of education. The problem is that when you're poor, young or undereducated, it takes more effort to overcome your immigrant family's low levels of political socialization. For first-generation Americans, politics is often just one more cultural expression that they must decipher on their own. It's rarely a priority. The immigrant parents that I spoke with swam rivers and boarded airplanes to escape violence, to earn money, to educate their children. Learning to play American politics was never on the agenda.\par \par \uc2 In Virginia, I found that serious political talk was so rare among the American-born children of Spanish-speaking immigrants that they would often ask me questions like ''What is the Tea Party?'' and ''Who is my mayor?'' Alicio Casta\u241\'00\'F1eda, a student at \uc2 George Mason University\uc2  whose parents are from Mexico, told me that after we had lunch in April, he began reading more news articles and researching deeper into the presidential candidates. He voted on Super Tuesday. His love for the soccer team Manchester United had led him to \uc2 The Guardian\uc2  newspaper, which reminded him that it was a big day in America. ''I've always been personally interested in politics,'' he told me, ''but I haven't had anyone to talk to about it.''\par \par \uc2 Until the 1960s, high schools often taught courses on democracy, civics and government. At the turn of the 21st century, most teenagers received one such class, or none. This drought in civics hurts all Americans, but for Latinos it's devastating. Several studies have found that merely hearing parents chat about politics or watching them cast a ballot improves the odds that a child will later vote as an adult. Yet a national survey directed by \uc2 Mark Hugo Lopez\uc2  in 2002 found that young Latinos were the least likely to have discussed politics with their parents. They were also the most likely to believe that voting is ''difficult.''\par \par \uc2 On Super Tuesday, I glimpsed what was missing among so many of the Latino families I spoke with when I met Kat Heller, a non-Hispanic mother, exiting a polling station with two children. Growing up in Minnesota, Heller had always tagged along with her parents when they voted. Once, when she was about 12, her father took her to watch the ballots being counted. ''I just remember feeling it was really exciting,'' she told me. ''It was seeing history happening. Everyone was waiting breathlessly.'' Inside the voting booth on Super Tuesday, Heller put her 3-year-old son on her hip and asked him: ''Which do you think we should vote for?'' His 13 touches had already begun.\par \par \uc2 Absent Tammany Hall and civics in schools, the work of turning ''new Americans'' into voters often falls to volunteers like Keisy Chavez. Several weekends this summer, Chavez, 45, has stood outside of Todos Supermarket and other locations in Northern Virginia, clipboard in hand, fishing for Latinos who haven't registered to vote. On the Saturday morning that I joined her, she looked surprisingly stylish for the occasion: gold-toned sandals, brilliant white capri pants, fiery nails and a bright orange T-shirt blazoned with the words ''New Virginia Majority.'' You could not engineer a better volunteer than Chavez to help turn out the Latino vote. Political appeals, social scientists have found, work best when delivered by co-ethnics. Chavez meets other requirements as well: She's bilingual, outgoing and frank.\par \par \uc2 A good rate for voter registration is two new registrations an hour. Chavez and her colleague hit the mark with four new registrations between them (the colleague waited for Chavez every time someone's dominant language was Spanish). Still, most passers-by ignored them. One 20-something with jet black hair who did stop told Chavez, in Spanish, that he was a citizen but not registered. She tried to reel him in.\par \par \uc2 ''O.K.,'' she responded with a smile, ''what is the problem?''\par \par \uc2 He said that he would come back to register next week, that she should give him her phone number.\par \par \uc2 ''What happens if you don't come next week?'' she asked him.\par \par \uc2 ''I promise you.''\par \par \uc2 ''You know what happens,'' she said. ''If you don't do it now, four more years will go by, and you won't vote.''\par \par \uc2 Back and forth they went for several minutes. Finally, seeing that Chavez wouldn't give him her number, the man walked away without registering. Winning votes, Lola Quintela of the \uc2 Fairfax County Democratic Committee\uc2  told me, is ''trabajo de hormiga'' -- ants' work, performed grain by grain.\par \par \uc2 The political scientist Lisa Garc\u237\'00\'EDa Bedolla proposed a different method in a 2005 paper for The Harvard Journal of Hispanic Policy. Because political engagement is strongly influenced by social ties, she argues, Latinos should improve their participation by politicizing their existing social networks. (She also pushes for civics in schools.) Several of the Latinos I met seemed to vote only because they were connected to a political junkie. Manuel Fernandez, 25, a Mexican-American born in New York State, prefers rebuilding and drifting cars to reading politics, but he has voted in local and presidential elections since he turned 18 because his father, Guadencio, a businessman, persuaded him to register to vote and tells him when and how to cast his ballots. ''Dad is really into it,'' he said. ''Whenever my dad says it's voting time, we go vote.''\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 Clinton\uc2  campaign is splitting its strategy between the tactics. After analyzing which programs worked best during the primaries, Praeli began pushing an expansion of Nevada's bilingual Mujeres in Politics program in battleground and ''expansion'' states across the country. Mujeres in Politics marshals Latinas for the ant work of canvassing and phone banking, but it also relies on social ties to deepen the campaign's reach into Latino communities. Each Latina who participates is tasked with the responsibility of drawing in five more Latina volunteers.\par \par \uc2 ''The theory for us was if you target Latinas and then you have Latinas talk to other Latinas, they're the best communicators to do that,'' Praeli told me. ''We see them as the C.E.O.s of their family and their communities. Part of my program description is you need to know that bodega with the highest foot traffic or the church secretary that can give you access to a faith community or who are the comadres in the neighborhood that have the largest influence. All you have to do is talk to a Latina to really understand that.'' Of course, it doesn't hurt that Latinas have voted in higher numbers than Latinos or that they were a key base for \uc2 Clinton\uc2  in the primaries.\par \par \uc2 Chavez herself was lured into politics by a Latina friend. For years after she settled in Virginia from Peru, she earned money washing dishes, waitressing, cleaning bathrooms, cleaning offices, ''cleaning anything,'' she says. At one point she held three jobs: a full-time job, a part-time job and a weekend job cleaning the airport at night. In 1996, she earned her real estate license. Then in 2009, after a friend asked her to walk with \uc2 Terry McAuliffe\uc2  in a parade, she was so smitten by his concern for Latinos that she decided to volunteer for his campaign for governor. For Chavez, the experience was intoxicating: ''I was like, 'Whoa, I did not know any of this existed.' '' She has volunteered for Virginia Democrats every year since then. \uc2 Election\uc2  season feels like a party to her. ''I have the best time,'' she told me. When Praeli spoke at the ''Latinos con Hillary'' event at Todos, Chavez was there, dressed head to toenails in blue.\par \par \uc2 The widespread assumption has been that rising numbers of Hispanic citizens will turn Virginia and other states in the South permanently Democratic. Certainly, with each \uc2 election\uc2  since 2001, Virginia Democrats have expanded their network of experienced Latino staff members and volunteers. Praeli and Figueroa's work depends on these veterans, a fact that \uc2 Clinton\uc2  tacitly acknowledged before Figueroa was even hired. On June 11, five days after The Associated Press called the Democratic primary for Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , the former president \uc2 Bill \uc2 Clinton\uc2  held a closed-door round table in Arlington with about 20 key Latino leaders from all over the state. He, like Praeli after him, was rallying troops.\par \par \uc2 But Latinos aren't natural Democrats, any more than they are natural Republicans. In 1984, Ronald Reagan won the presidency with nearly half their vote in California. In 2004, George W. Bush won a second term with 40 percent of the national Latino vote, setting off panic in Democratic circles. And even in 2012, 33 percent of the Latino vote in Virginia went to \uc2 Mitt Romney\uc2 . He also took 39 percent of the Latino vote in Florida and 42 percent in Ohio.\par \par \uc2 From the beginning, Latino voters have been up for grabs. The national electoral bloc that we now call the Hispanic vote was created by middle- and upper-class Mexican-American Democrats who wanted more clout in government and politics. According to the historian Ignacio M. Garc\u237\'00\'EDa's book on the subject, they organized ''Viva Kennedy'' clubs in Texas, California, New Mexico, Indiana, Illinois and elsewhere. Working together under an absurd logo of \uc2 John Kennedy\uc2  riding a grinning burro, these grass-roots clubs turned out thousands of Spanish speakers in delegate-rich states, helping Kennedy squeak into the White House by a margin of less than 1 percent of the popular vote. But Republicans pushed the strategy further: In ''Making Hispanics,'' Mora shows how members of Richard Nixon's 1972 re-\uc2 election\uc2  campaign, who nicknamed themselves the ''Brown Mafia,'' ran Spanish-language ads on radio and television. They crafted three distinct campaigns to bring in not just Mexican-Americans but also Puerto Ricans and Cuban-Americans. With their help, Nixon was re-elected by a landslide, taking about 35 percent of what was then known as the ''Spanish speaking'' vote. The real loss for Republicans since President George W. Bush left office is that their candidates have frittered away the affections that he and Reagan earned among Latinos.\par \par \uc2 Many conservative Hispanics I spoke with in Virginia told me that they don't fit neatly into either party. They would prefer a candidate who legalizes undocumented immigrants, outlaws abortion, makes college education free, wipes out drugs and gangs, rolls back the legal right to gay marriage, supports small-business credits and raises the minimum wage. Immigration reform might be a distinguishing concern for Latinos, but a recent report from Pew found that, as in previous presidential contests, it is not the top issue for Latino voters. More Latino voters say that the economy, health care and terrorism are very important.\par \par \uc2 Several of the Catholic Latinos I met said that abortion laws were their top priority. ''If we can close that one clinic,'' Iris Chavez told me with a sparkle in her eye, referring to a Planned Parenthood-like women's clinic that was once located in Manassas, ''we can set fire to the nation.'' Chavez, 26, was brought into the United States illegally from El Salvador when she was 11 and was protected by Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, which Obama created in 2012 for undocumented millennials who came to the United States as children. She works part-time as a secretary at All Saints Catholic Church, where so many Latinos attend the Sunday afternoon, Spanish-language Mass that they spill from the pews to stand three to four deep against the walls. She doesn't much like \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2 , she told me, but if she could vote, she would vote for him based on her belief that abortion is murder.\par \par \uc2 Chavez is the kind of Latino that Nixon's ''Brown Mafia'' was after -- the same kind that Reagan tried to embrace with his 1986 amnesty, which legalized 2.7 million Hispanics who had no criminal history, and the kind that Reince Priebus had hoped the \uc2 Republican National Committee\uc2 's 2012 \uc2 election\uc2  autopsy would provoke Republicans to seek again. If the party had followed George W. Bush's lead, Todos Supermarket might have become a site for G.O.P. events. Carlos Castro, its owner, considered himself ''almost 100 percent Republican'' until 2007, when the Republicans of Prince William County championed an anti-Hispanic ''Immigration Resolution,'' and he began to reconsider. He's now an independent. Other conservatives in the county told me that they would keep their votes out of everybody's reach until a candidate arrives whom they can fully support.\par \par \uc2 The specter of \uc2 Trump\uc2  has roused many Latinos to change their minds about registering; spikes have been documented in North Carolina and Georgia. In California, the rise in registrations early this year was almost double what it was during the same period in 2012. Jairo Castillo, a Nicaraguan-American construction worker in Virginia, complained to me in April that the vote ''doesn't count,'' but after \uc2 Trump\uc2  secured the Republican nomination in June, he registered to vote for the first time.\par \par \uc2 Even if a ''\uc2 Trump\uc2  effect'' among Latinos this year does help put \uc2 Clinton\uc2  in the White House, will those new voters stay engaged? History suggests they might not. According to the political scientists Matt Barreto and Gary M. Segura, more than a million Latinos in California registered to vote for the first time in the years after the state passed Proposition 187, a 1994 ballot initiative. Prop. 187 prohibited undocumented immigrants from state-funded institutions, like schools, and required police officers to report their arrests to federal immigration authorities. In a statewide \uc2 election\uc2 , the initiative passed with 59 percent of the vote. \uc2 Pete Wilson\uc2 , the Republican governor who had championed the measure, won re-\uc2 election\uc2  that same fall. Prop. 187 was soon tied up in federal court, which ruled many of its elements unconstitutional, but California's electorate soon went on to pass a ban on affirmative action (Prop. 209) and a reduction in bilingual education (Prop. 227). Both measures were widely regarded as anti-Hispanic.\par \par \uc2 Prop. 187 and its cousins had notoriously partisan effects in California. In a paper published in The American Journal of Political Science in 2006, the political scientists \uc2 Shaun Bowler\uc2 , Stephen P. Nicholson and Segura found that before 1994 Latinos split their votes almost equally between the two parties. By contrast, after the passage of these propositions, the probability that a Latino would identify as Republican fell by more than two-thirds, erasing all the gains that Republicans made since Ronald Reagan's 1980 campaign. Data also revealed that the propositions moved many non-Hispanic whites in California into the Democratic column. Attacking undocumented immigrants and Latinos had provoked a white backlash against Republicans that mirrors the disaffection that \uc2 Trump\uc2 's nomination has stirred among many party moderates this season.\par \par \uc2 But as time went on, Prop. 187's effect on Latino turnout revealed itself to be not a turning point but a blip. Last September, The \uc2 Los Angeles Times\uc2  noted that only 17 percent of eligible California Latinos voted in 2014. Turnout was similar among Asian-Americans, while all other racial and ethnic groups combined voted more than twice as much. ''By all accounts, the Central Valley is a place where Latino candidates should win elections,'' the reporter Kate Linthicum noted. ''Yet Latino candidates' \uc2 election\uc2  losses have piled up here in recent years -- in large part because Latinos aren't turning out to vote.''\par \par \uc2 Among those defeated in 2014 was Amanda Renteria, now the national political director for Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's presidential campaign. Renteria ran for Congress in a Central Valley district that was 74 percent Hispanic. She grew up in the Central Valley and taught math at her old high school in Woodlake before attending \uc2 Harvard Business School\uc2  and becoming the first Latina chief of staff in the history of the Senate. She lost her 2014 bid for Congress by 17 points. If Latinos had turned out for her at the levels that African-Americans turned out for Obama, it's possible that today she would sit in Congress.\par \par \uc2 This March, the \uc2 Public Policy Institute of California\uc2  released a report that detailed the gulf that has opened up in California politics since the Prop. 187 surge. ''Voters in California,'' it noted, ''tend to be older, white, college educated, affluent and homeowners. They also tend to identify themselves as 'haves' -- rather than 'have-nots' -- when asked to choose between these two economic categories. Nonvoters tend to be younger, Latino, renters, less affluent and less likely to be college educated than likely voters -- and they generally identify themselves as have-nots.''\par \par \uc2 California may be a majority-minority state in terms of its population, the report observed, but its electorate is not: 60 percent of its likely voters are white, while only 18 percent are Latino. It would be na\u239\'00\'EFve, however, to expect Democrats to throw themselves wholeheartedly into the project of turning out the state's Hispanics given that they already control solid majorities in California's State Assembly and State Senate.\par \par \uc2 ''We have to be honest,'' Mar\u237\'00\'EDa Teresa Kumar, the president and co-founder of Voto Latino, a nonpartisan organization, told me last fall. ''When it comes to voter registration, each party is looking to the Latino community and the African-American community for enough votes. They don't need us all.'' From her office in Washington, she directs efforts to engage young Latinos who are often navigating the political system for their families. ''Our job,'' Kumar said, ''is to do true political empowerment: It's mass mobilization and mass participation. And for parties, it's about how little do they need to spend to get over the top.''\par \par \uc2 If Virginia's battleground status suggests a triumph of the Latino vote, it also provides a cautionary tale about its limitations. In early August, Senator Tim Kaine, Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's running mate, appeared in the green-and-yellow gymnasium of Huguenot High School in Richmond. ''Yes, we Kaine!'' the crowd shouted under the floodlights. His homecoming rally doubled as a history lesson. Kaine pointed out that Virginia had gone 170 years without a president or vice-president. When he moved to Virginia in 1984, he said, neither Republicans nor Democrats bothered to campaign in the state, a situation that he attributed to a conservative lock on power that depended upon marginalizing women and minorities. ''We pushed you away from the table,'' he said. But since \uc2 Barack Obama\uc2  turned Virginia into a battleground, it has become a campaign stop for every would-be president. ''It's much better to live in state where no one can take you for granted,'' Kaine said.\par \par \uc2 The shift that brought volunteers like Keisy Chavez to the Democratic table actually began long before Obama. When Mark Warner was elected governor in 2001, his campaign strategy relied on winning rural, Nascar-loving Republicans, not on including minorities. But Kaine's own gubernatorial victory in 2005 used an urban-suburban strategy that relied upon the participation of Northern Virginia's fast-growing, multiethnic communities. Given Kaine's experiences arguing civil rights cases and his work as a missionary in Honduras, the shift may have reflected personal affinities. It was also a canny response to Virginia's changing demographics. According to the \uc2 University of Virginia\uc2 's Demographics Research Group, in 1970 only one in 100 Virginians were born outside of the United States. By 2012, that ratio had increased to one in nine. Such demographic transformations are hardly unique to the state. Between 1990 and 2008, the number of Latinos living in Arkansas, Alabama, Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina and Tennessee grew by 602 percent, prompting political scientists to dub the region the ''Nuevo South.'' ''If you put your faith in the Virginia voter,'' Kaine recalled telling the candidate Obama in 2008, ''You're going to win Virginia.''\par \par \uc2 Yet the majority of Virginia's General Assembly is still Republican, and only two of its state-level representatives, the delegates Alfonso Lopez and Jason Miyares, are Latino. Harry Wiggins, the chairman of Prince William County's Democratic Committee, described the problem like this: ''We win the presidential. We won for Mark Warner. We won for Tim Kaine. We won for \uc2 Terry McAuliffe\uc2 . Yet the county board we lose, because they have off-year elections, and we have very light turnout.''\par \par \uc2 Figueroa is already preparing for the inevitable drop. ''The numbers are going to plummet next year in places that count, like Prince William,'' he told me. In 2015, the Census Bureau weighed Prince William County at 22.3 percent Latino, 21.8 percent African-American and 8.7 percent Asian. The chairman of its board of supervisors, however, is Corey Stewart, a Republican, who is also chairman of \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2 's campaign in the state. ''When he is president and I am governor, you're going to see one helluva tag team in Virginia, and we're finally going to remove illegal immigrants,'' Stewart told The Richmond Times-Dispatch in June. The gubernatorial race will occur next year, when no other state in the country except New Jersey will be holding elections.\par \par \uc2 While Kaine spoke, Figueroa stood near the press box, tapping at his phone and taking in the scene. In the days leading up to the rally, he mentioned several times that he was working to make the event ''blacker and browner.'' His handiwork was evident in the V.I.P. bleachers directly in front of the television cameras, where a group of people sat, many of them wearing the unmistakable bright blue-and-white jerseys of El Salvador's national soccer team. They were students, parents and teachers associated with the English-as-a-second-language program at Huguenot High School and its International Club. Their V.I.P. seating had come from Figueroa. Their homemade red, white and blue sign ''Juntos Se Puede!'' (''Together we can!'') gave Kaine a camera-ready opportunity that he seized, pointing to them and leading a round of ''S\u237\'00\'ED se puede!'' -- a chant that will always have special resonance for those who know that it originated not in 2008 with Obama but with Cesar Chavez and Dolores Huerta in 1972.\par \par \uc2 After Kaine finished his speech, as ''Shake It Off'' blasted through the gym, several of these students joined the throng vying for an opportunity to snap a selfie with him. I asked two of them what they knew about Kaine. ''He was mayor of Virginia,'' one said. The other added that he had lived in Honduras and was a friend of Latinos. That was all that they seemed to know. Two parents I spoke with told me, in Spanish, that they understood only pieces of Kaine's speech, which was in English. This explained why one father appeared so poker-faced through much of the rally. Unless his son translated the speeches for him, he couldn't form an opinion. He didn't understand what was being said.\par \par \uc2 Sign up for our newsletter to get the best of The \uc2 New York Times Magazine\uc2  delivered to your inbox every week.\par \par \uc2 Marcela Valdes is a writer based in Maryland.

\par\par \uc2 NEWS ANALYSIS\par \uc2 Sunday Review Desk; SECTSR\par \b \uc2 An Al Qaeda Martyr's Enduring Pitch\b0\par\par\uc2 By SCOTT SHANE \par \uc2 1,336 \uc2 words\par \uc2 18 September 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 5\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Hiding out from American drones in Yemen's badlands in March 2010, Al Qaeda's most persuasive English-language recruiter donned a camo jacket and addressed American and European Muslims.\par \par \uc2 ''Today, with the war between Muslims and the West escalating,'' Anwar al-Awlaki said in the video, ''you cannot count on the message of solidarity you may get from a civic group or a political party, or the word of support you hear from a kind neighbor or a nice co-worker. The West will eventually turn against its Muslim citizens.''\par \par \uc2 It was an audacious pitch. No matter what you may think, the American-born Mr. Awlaki told Western Muslims, sooner or later your governments and fellow citizens will come after you. So you must join our violent cause.\par \par \uc2 On Sept. 30, it will be five years since the C.I.A. drone strike in Yemen that killed Mr. Awlaki, the first United States citizen executed without trial on orders of a president since the Civil War. But the Hellfire missile that ended his life promoted him to martyrdom in the eyes of his fans, and his influence has turned up in terrorism case after terrorism case. His videos, forecasting a West in which Muslims would increasingly be denigrated, marginalized and threatened with expulsion or worse, have been viewed by hundreds of thousands.\par \par \uc2 For years those prognostications fell flat. But had he lived to see it, the last year might have given Mr. Awlaki a belated sense of vindication. In the United States, a major party presidential candidate proposed a ''total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States,'' drawing raucous applause. Outspoken anti-Muslim politicians in Europe have won unprecedented support. In a tragicomic spectacle in France, armed police officers surrounded a Muslim woman in a bathing outfit designed for religious modesty, as if her garb posed some dire threat.\par \par \uc2 At rallies and on social media in many countries, anxious people cry that Muslims are the enemy, and the number of hate crimes aimed at them has ballooned. ''This presidential \uc2 election\uc2  has redefined social norms in America,'' Hazem Bata, the secretary general of the Islamic Society of North America, said at the group's convention this month. ''Things that were only said behind closed doors one year ago are now said out in the open, on TV, on radio, without any sense of embarrassment.''\par \par \uc2 The anti-Muslim language, of course, has grown in part from real tragedies. In San Bernardino, Calif., and Orlando, Fla., and in Paris, Brussels and Nice, France, a few people chose to obey Mr. Awlaki's twisted command, later echoed by the Islamic State, that any Muslim in Europe or America has a duty to carry out attacks at home.\par \par \uc2 In the United States, jihadist killings in the 15 years since the Sept. 11 attacks remain a rounding error -- fewer than 100 killed out of more than 220,000 homicides. But terrorism, a word with roots in the Latin for ''to cause to tremble,'' gets that name for a reason. By shooting up a nightclub or mowing down people with a truck, ostensibly in the name of Islam, attackers send the message that no one is safe -- and that any Muslim may be a threat.\par \par \uc2 The resulting Islamophobia does the work of Al Qaeda and the Islamic State for them. Rather than draw the circle of opprobrium around a tiny number of violent fanatics, some worried Westerners draw it around the world's 1.6 billion Muslims. Yet if all Muslims are smeared as potential enemies, some become more susceptible to the siren call of Mr. Awlaki and his fellow recruiters.\par \par \uc2 ''Terrorism is a strategy of provocation,'' said Bruce Hoffman, director of security studies at \uc2 Georgetown University\uc2 . ''Al Qaeda and ISIS hope to provoke violence that will deepen the cleavages in our society and encourage the demonization of Muslims. When political leaders denigrate Muslims, terrorist groups can grab hold of that and make use of it.''\par \par \uc2 In his early career as an American imam, Mr. Awlaki rejected terrorist violence. As a preacher in a big mosque outside Washington, he condemned the Sept. 11 attacks. ''We came here to build, not to destroy,'' he told his congregation. ''We are the bridge between America and one billion Muslims worldwide.''\par \par \uc2 Later, in the English-language Al Qaeda magazine he oversaw, Inspire, he blamed American policy for his disillusionment. ''With the American invasion of Iraq and continued U.S. aggression against Muslims I could not reconcile between living in the U.S. and being a Muslim, and I eventually came to the conclusion that jihad against America is binding upon myself just as it is binding on every other able Muslim,'' he wrote.\par \par \uc2 As I found while researching a book on Mr. Awlaki, that was not the whole story. In 2002, Mr. Awlaki, a married father of three, learned that the F.B.I. knew his biggest secret: that he regularly visited prostitutes in Washington hotels. Fearing ruin, he fled the United States and started down the path that ended with \uc2 Al Qaeda in Yemen\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 He soon stopped speaking of bridge building. By 2003, lecturing to young Muslim fans in London, he told them they should ''never, ever trust the kuffar'' -- non-Muslims. In 2006, in 22 lectures on ''The Hereafter,'' he cited prophecies about a future apocalyptic battle between Muslims and all others. ''Islam will rule the world,'' he declared. ''Kuffar will be stamped out.'' For nonbelievers, he added, the choice will be ''either Islam or death.''\par \par \uc2 Those lectures became favorites of both Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, the younger of the two brothers who bombed the Boston Marathon in 2013, and Syed Farook, who along with his wife fatally shot 14 people in San Bernardino last year.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Awlaki's jihadist cause requires a clash of civilizations -- Western Muslims rejecting their neighbors to rally around a bloody, bigoted and backward version of Islam. So he hoped for Islamophobia run amok, driving fearful Muslims to support a global jihad. Yet despite eruptions of anti-Muslim passions here and there, Mr. Awlaki's dire predictions seemed delusional.\par \par \uc2 When Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2  called for a ban on Muslims entering the United States, jihadists were gleeful. The Somali affiliate of Al Qaeda, Al Shabab, created a propaganda video combining Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's statement with Mr. Awlaki's warnings about the West turning on Muslims. For a group trying to lure Somali-Americans to its ranks, any sign of hostility to Muslims in the United States was a boon.\par \par \uc2 But the harsh language heard at \uc2 Trump\uc2  rallies and on talk radio masks an unexpected trend, said Shibley Telhami, a political scientist at the University of Maryland.\par \par \uc2 From November to June, a period of terrorist attacks and denunciations of Islam, American views of Islam and Muslims actually improved slightly on average in polling overseen by Mr. Telhami -- a mark, he said, of opposition to Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 . ''\uc2 Trump\uc2 's opponents have an interest in offering a counterargument, that Islam and Muslims are not the problem,'' he said.\par \par \uc2 At the same time, Mr. Telhami said, ''there's a noisy minority that has become far more hostile to Islam and Muslims.'' That has shaken American Muslims. ''It's a frightening and unpredictable thing for Muslims who have a child in school or worry that they'll be embarrassed or even harmed on the street,'' he said.\par \par \uc2 Back in 2010, Mr. Awlaki told Western Muslims that ''ominous clouds'' were gathering and predicted that the United States would become ''a land of religious discrimination and concentration camps.'' It was hyperbole. But it is worth remembering that for jihadists, it was also a fervent hope.\par \par \uc2 Scott Shane is a reporter for The New York Times and the author of ''Objective Troy: A Terrorist, a President, and the Rise of the Drone.''\par \par \uc2 Anwar al-Awlaki speaking in a video message posted on radical websites in 2010.

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 WASHINGTON -- When \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2  descended on the capital Friday, he was expected to finally concede that the racially tinged falsehood he had gleefully propagated, that President Obama was born outside of the United States, had in fact been a lie.\par \par \uc2 But before Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  got around to what was a grudging and terse admission, which itself included a falsehood about the provenance of so-called birtherism, he had some business to tend to.\par \par \uc2 ''Nice hotel,'' said Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , the Republican nominee for president, delighting in his newest property and the opportunity to plug it free on live television. He was holding his news conference at his new hotel in the Old Post Office building on Pennsylvania Avenue, which, he promised, is ''going to be something very special.''\par \par \uc2 He seemed untroubled in using an ostensible campaign event just a few blocks from the White House to openly promote his personal commercial interests 52 days before the \uc2 election\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 In fact, this past week offered a vivid illustration of how little regard Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  has for the long-held expectations of America's leaders. He is not only breaking the country's political norms, he and his campaign aides are now all but mocking them.\par \par \uc2 Besides using his campaign as a platform to make money on a new hotel, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  leveled an untrue assertion that \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  had been the first to claim Mr. Obama was born abroad. He also boasted about his health on the show of a daytime television celebrity while releasing just his testosterone levels and a few other details about his well-being.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  also continued to flout 40 years of tradition by refusing to release his tax returns, a decision that his eldest son admitted this week was not based on an audit, as Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  has repeatedly claimed, but on a desire not to ''distract'' from the campaign's ''main message.''\par \par \uc2 Beyond his handling of personal information, he also casually accused the chairwoman of the Federal Reserve of corruption, claimed that the bipartisan national debate commission was rigged against him, and stated that Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  had not proposed a child care plan. (She has, and did so a year before he did.)\par \par \uc2 He also mocked an African-American pastor who had just welcomed him to her church, and again referred to Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, who once said she had Native American roots, as ''Pocahontas.''\par \par \uc2 And that was all before Friday night, when Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  hinted at violence against Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  by inviting her Secret Service detail to disarm ''and see what happens to her.''\par \par \uc2 Routine falsehoods, unfounded claims and inflammatory language have long been staples of Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's anything-goes campaign. But as the polls tighten and November nears, his behavior, and the implications for the country should he become president, are alarming veteran political observers -- and leaving them deeply worried about the precedent being set, regardless of who wins the White House.\par \par \uc2 ''It's frightening,'' said \uc2 Vin Weber\uc2 , a former Republican congressman from Minnesota. ''Our politics, because of him, is descending to the level of a third-world country. There's just nothing beneath him. And I don't know why we would think he would change if he became president. That's what's really scary.''\par \par \uc2 Stephen Hess\uc2 , who served in the Eisenhower and Nixon administrations, could not even contemplate the prospect of Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  as commander in chief.\par \par \uc2 ''It's incredibly depressing,'' Mr. Hess said of Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 . ''He's the most profoundly ignorant man I've ever seen at this level in terms of understanding the American presidency, and, even more troubling, he makes no effort to learn anything.''\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's advocates insist that the critics are missing the larger impact of his candidacy, and how his campaign and presidency could be a force for good. As a New York Times-CBS poll released last week indicated, voters see him as more likely to aggressively confront what they see as a rotten political system, even if they recognize Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  as a risky choice.\par \par \uc2 ''On the things that are really big, he will in some clumsy way force real change,'' said \uc2 Newt Gingrich\uc2 , the former House speaker, who is an adviser to Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 . ''Washington won't be the same when he's done.''\par \par \uc2 But that is what is so worrisome to many observers of Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's rise. His critics fear that his norm-breaking campaign portends a political future in which candidates pay no penalty for unabashedly telling untruths, disregarding the public's right to know, and lobbing racially charged accusations.\par \par \uc2 ''I worry that if those of us in politics and the media don't do a lot of soul-searching after this \uc2 election\uc2 , a slightly smarter \uc2 Trump\uc2  will succeed in the future,'' said Jon Favreau, Mr. Obama's former chief speechwriter. ''For some politicians and consultants, the takeaway from this \uc2 election\uc2  will be that they can get away with almost anything.''\par \par \uc2 As Martin Nolan, a former editor and reporter at The Boston Globe who has chronicled politics for over 50 years put it: ''Truth has a low priority in the misnomer known as reality TV.''\par \par \uc2 ''Rules,'' Mr. Nolan added, ''are for losers.''\par \par \uc2 The only salvation this year, argue Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's detractors, is that he is a singular figure in American life, and his would-be successors will not be able to skirt accountability in the fashion of the celebrity provocateur.\par \par \uc2 ''He has inflicted Stockholm syndrome on America,'' said \uc2 Stacey Abrams\uc2 , a Democrat and the minority leader of the Georgia House. ''It's not even that we're numb to it, it's just that we've always enjoyed the show. It's entertaining to hate him, to like him and to imagine being him.''\par \par \uc2 But while there may not be another Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , he does seem to have thrust the country into a new era. With American culture increasingly coarse and ever more obsessed with celebrity, the country's politics were bound to eventually catch up.\par \par \uc2 Less than 25 years after \uc2 Bill \uc2 Clinton\uc2  shocked some by unabashedly answering a question about his underwear preference on television, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  purposefully brought up the size of his penis at a televised debate.\par \par \uc2 It is not difficult to find Republicans who recoil at how their own nominee has, to borrow the phrase made famous by Daniel Patrick Moynihan, the former New York senator and sociologist, defined deviancy down.\par \par \uc2 ''\uc2 Trump\uc2  is reflecting a culture that is more crass, more accepting of vulgarity and more attuned to pop culture,'' said Matt Lewis, a conservative writer. ''The bar has been lowered where going on Dr. Oz is perfectly acceptable and maybe even cutting edge.''\par \par \uc2 Where Republicans differ is over whether the acceptance of Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's transgressions is just as ominous for the country.\par \par \uc2 ''You can't have a republic without virtue and I don't think there's great virtue in either of them,'' said Tom Coburn, the former Oklahoma senator, of Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  and Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Still, Mr. Weber, who arrived in Washington as a congressional staff member shortly after the post-Watergate \uc2 election\uc2  of 1974, said Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's approach would inflict the most damage on his own party.\par \par \uc2 ''You don't want to say this is the equivalent of Watergate,'' Mr. Weber said. ''But at least that was a discrete crime. In a way, \uc2 Trump\uc2  is harder to deal with. And Republicans didn't feel compelled to defend Watergate: they drove Richard Nixon out of office.''\par \par \uc2 Find out what you need to know about the 2016 presidential race today, and get politics news updates via \uc2 Facebook\uc2 , \uc2 Twitter\uc2  and the First Draft newsletter.\par \par \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2  at the new \uc2 Trump\uc2  International Hotel in Washington on Friday. ''Nice hotel,'' he said at a news conference there.

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 A decade ago, lawmakers in Washington tried to address a trifecta of thorny challenges with one simple fix that has turned out to be anything but easy to assess.\par \par \uc2 The problems: an overreliance on foreign oil, rising greenhouse gas emissions and tepid economic growth.\par \par \uc2 The solution: the Renewable Fuel Standard, commonly known as the ethanol mandate. Enacted in 2005 and expanded two years later, the legislation required that refiners blend an increasing amount of biofuel into the gasoline that powers most American cars.\par \par \uc2 The logic was straightforward. More ethanol production would in theory reduce America's dependence on oil from the Middle East. Because biofuel generally releases less in greenhouse gases than fossil fuel when burned, all that ethanol would be good for the environment, too. And by stimulating demand for domestically produced ethanol, made largely from corn, the mandate would prop up farmers and refiners.\par \par \uc2 In the intervening years, the ethanol industry has ballooned into an economic juggernaut. Last year, the industry contributed an estimated $44 billion to the economy.\par \par \uc2 Those numbers are set to become bigger. The \uc2 Environmental Protection Agency\uc2 , which administers the mandate, effectively increased the amount of ethanol required to be added to gasoline to 17.4 billion gallons this year, an annual increase of about 9 percent over 2015. The mandate calls for production to nearly double to 36 billion gallons by 2022, and in theory, much of that will be cellulosic ethanol, made from crops other than corn, like sugar cane and switch grass.\par \par \uc2 Yet even as the Renewable Fuel Standard exerts its powerful sway, there is hardly consensus about whether it has delivered on the lofty promises lawmakers made a decade ago.\par \par \uc2 Indeed, depending on whom you ask, the Renewable Fuel Standard is either one of the best policy decisions to come out of Washington in decades or a special-interest boondoggle that costs taxpayers billions of dollars and harms the environment.\par \par \uc2 Supporters of the mandate claim it has reduced America's dependence on foreign oil, helped the environment and spurred economic growth, all while saving consumers money.\par \par \uc2 ''Ethanol is the great American success story,'' said Emily Skor, chief executive of Growth Energy, a group that represents ethanol suppliers and producers, including \uc2 Dow Chemical\uc2  and \uc2 DuPont\uc2 , two big agricultural companies working on a complex merger. ''The R.F.S. is the policy that has allowed Americans to access cleaner, cheaper fuel at the pump.''\par \par \uc2 To back up these claims, Ms. Skor and her allies proffer reams of data that portray ethanol as a solution for many of the country's problems. They say ethanol has made America less reliant on Middle Eastern oil, saved consumers up to $1 a gallon at the pump and spared the air from vast clouds of harmful carbon emissions.\par \par \uc2 Of course, Ms. Skor has a vested interest in advancing this narrative. Were the Renewable Fuel Standard to be repealed, many of the companies that support Growth Energy would lose millions of dollars.\par \par \uc2 Critics of the ethanol mandate are just as adamant that it has been a colossal failure. They point out that domestic oil and natural gas production has surged in recent years as a result of hydraulic fracturing. They argue that because ethanol refineries are consuming so much corn, the cost of food is going up. And many say that when ethanol production and carbon dioxide absorption by crops like corn are factored in, ethanol is no better for the environment than gasoline.\par \par \uc2 As with supporters of the ethanol mandate, many ardent critics are beholden to their own special interests. Among the most vocal antagonists of the law is the \uc2 American Petroleum Institute\uc2 , with members including \uc2 Exxon Mobil\uc2  and \uc2 Royal Dutch Shell\uc2 . Big Oil has been opposed to the Renewable Fuel Standard from the beginning -- after all, as more ethanol is blended into gasoline, the less oil it sells.\par \par \uc2 The debate has become binary. Depending on which army of lobbyists you believe, the Renewable Fuel Standard is either an unqualified success or an unmitigated disaster. But of course, the truth is rarely quite so simple.\par \par \uc2 There's no doubt that thanks largely to the enormous increase in domestic oil and gas production, America's energy security is not the concern it was a decade ago. Yet it is also true that the strong rise in ethanol production has helped.\par \par \uc2 ''Did it give us energy independence? No,'' said James H. Stock, an economics professor at Harvard. ''Has it been helpful? Sure.''\par \par \uc2 When it comes to the hope that the Renewable Fuel Standard would support domestic economies, the results have also been mixed. Ethanol is a big business, but it was always going to be highly localized in top corn-producing regions. That's why in Iowa, the Renewable Fuel Standard is sacrosanct.\par \par \uc2 As for the promise that more ethanol would mean less harmful emissions, the data is decidedly mixed. Several independent analyses, including authoritative studies from the Department of Energy's Argonne National Laboratory in Illinois, suggest that ethanol releases significantly less greenhouse gas emissions than gasoline.\par \par \uc2 But a recent paper in the journal Climatic Change by John M. DeCicco, a research professor at the University of Michigan who previously worked for the \uc2 Environmental Defense Fund\uc2 , made a compelling case that the carbon dioxide being released by ethanol was not being absorbed at nearly the rate expected.\par \par \uc2 ''There's an assumption that anything that's not oil has got to be good,'' Mr. DeCicco said. ''It's not that simple.''\par \par \uc2 Almost as soon as Mr. DeCicco's paper came out, Steffen Mueller, an economist at the Energy Resources Center at the University of Illinois at Chicago, issued a rebuttal. And then there was the note at the end of Mr. DeCicco's paper: ''The work reported here was supported by the \uc2 American Petroleum Institute\uc2 .''\par \par \uc2 With so many dueling claims and special interests at play, it's hard to know what to think. In this overheated debate, any assertion about ethanol's worthiness or lack thereof is immediately shot down by the other side.\par \par \uc2 During this \uc2 election\uc2  season, the Renewable Fuel Standard has emerged as a minor issue. Senator Ted Cruz drew fire from Iowa caucusgoers for coming out against the ethanol mandate, while both major party presidential nominees, Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2  and \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , have voiced their support for the law.\par \par \uc2 Congress is well aware that the Renewable Fuel Standard is mired in controversy. House and Senate subcommittees held hearings on the mandate this year in the hope that some consensus might emerge. That didn't happen, though.\par \par \uc2 Instead, emissaries from both camps descended on Capitol Hill armed with studies that made their case in the most striking terms, pitting the interests of agricultural behemoths against those of oil giants.\par \par \uc2 The truth is probably somewhere in between. The Renewable Fuel Standard probably hasn't been the most effective environmental policy. America was going to become less reliant on foreign oil with or without it, the direct beneficiaries were too few and too localized, and the climate science was frustratingly inconclusive.\par \par \uc2 But the perfect should not be the enemy of the good, and the ethanol mandate has not been a catastrophe. What it has become is a political battleground, another reminder that when competing interest groups try to dictate energy policy, the truth becomes cloudy.\par \par \uc2 DRAWING (DRAWING BY MINH UONG/THE NEW YORK TIMES) \par \par \uc2 Document NYTF000020160918ec9i0009a\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 FEATURE\par \uc2 Magazine Desk; SECTMM\par \b \uc2 The Gang That Failed\b0\par\par\uc2 By ALEC MacGILLIS \par \uc2 7,416 \uc2 words\par \uc2 18 September 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 53\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 CORRECTION APPENDEDIn June, not long after \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  attacked an Indiana-born judge because he was ''Mexican,'' I went to go see Representative Ra\u250\'00\'FAl Labrador in the Longworth Office Building on Capitol Hill. Labrador, an Idaho Republican, cuts an unusual profile in Washington. Born in Puerto Rico, he was raised Mormon by a single mother in Las Vegas and now, as he told me, represents ''one of the most conservative districts in the United States, one of the whitest districts in the United States.'' Labrador came to Congress as part of the Tea Party wave of 2010 and later helped found the Freedom Caucus, the House's conservative vanguard. He was also a pivotal member of a bipartisan group of eight House members who, in early 2013, came together in hopes of producing comprehensive legislation to fix the nation's immigration system.\par \par \uc2 Today, nearly every word of that last sentence feels as if it were ripped from a political fiction of ''West Wing''-level implausibility. Immigration is the conflict that has eaten the 2016 elections -- relegating other pressing issues to the margins, embodying Washington's political dysfunction, further polarizing a divided country and, above all, fueling the presidential campaign of a man who began his candidacy by vowing to build a wall to keep Mexico from sending ''rapists'' to America. In recent weeks, even \uc2 Trump\uc2 's own campaign seems to have grown alarmed by the political toxicity of what it has unleashed, embarking on a series of incoherent revisions before settling back on hard talk about creating a ''special deportation task force.''\par \par \uc2 But just four years ago, Republican leaders, coming off a presidential \uc2 election\uc2  in which their candidate received barely a quarter of the Hispanic vote, made a concerted push to reach a compromise on immigration reform. President \uc2 Obama\uc2 , too, elevated it as one of the top issues of his second term. Two days after the \uc2 election\uc2 , Speaker \uc2 John Boehner\uc2  told ABC News that reform was ''long overdue,'' saying that ''I'm confident that the president, myself, others can find the common ground to take care of this issue once and for all.'' At a time when Congress, because of the strategic calculus of its Republican leadership, was struggling to pass such once-rudimentary measures as budgets and highway bills, and bipartisan legislative efforts had become a snow-leopard-like rarity in Washington, it was a remarkable moment: The parties' imperatives had converged on what everyone involved envisioned as a historic piece of legislation to resolve one of the nation's most conspicuous problems, a broken immigration system that had left 11 million people undocumented.\par \par \uc2 The immigration bill was supposed to be a relatively straightforward en\u173\'00\'ADdeavor -- not politically painless, by any means, but a clear win for all the parties involved, enough so that it came much closer to happening than most people think. ''I've never been involved in an issue where there's no organized opposition to it,'' Representative John Yarmuth of Louisville, Ky., one of Labrador's Democratic colleagues in the Group of 8, told me. ''It's so bizarre when you have the business community, organized labor, the faith community, law enforcement, you name it, everybody's for it. Come on -- how can you have something everybody's for and not get it passed?''\par \par \uc2 But the bill did not pass. And its failure revealed how fully the Republican Party had boxed itself in in Congress -- the degree to which it had been paralyzed by its own extremity and tactical logic, and the degree to which this intransigence had produced a cynicism among Demo\u173\'00\'ADcrats that amounted to a self-fulfilling prophecy. In retrospect, Congress left itself open to the rise of someone like \uc2 Trump\uc2 , who, with his blend of nativism and anti-Washingtonism, was able to draw on resentment of undocumented immigrants themselves and resentment of Washington's inability to come up with a solution for the problem.\par \par \uc2 I didn't bring up \uc2 Trump\uc2  in my conversation with Labrador, but Labrador did. In the midst of talking about the collapse of the immigration-reform effort he had been part of, he broke off and said, matter-of-factly: ''The reason we have \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  as a nominee today is because we as Republicans have failed on this issue.''\par \par \uc2 It's easy to forget how recently the Hispanic vote was viewed as up for grabs. In 2004, George W. Bush won 44 percent of Latino voters. As late as 2006, Demo\u173\'00\'ADcrats and Republicans responded similarly to a \uc2 Pew Research Center\uc2  question about whether immigrants ''strengthen our country because of their hard work and talents,'' with about 40 percent in each party saying yes.\par \par \uc2 Seeking to secure lasting Hispanic support for Republicans, Bush in 2007 threw his support behind a bipartisan push for comprehensive immigration reform on the Hill. But the legislation failed amid a talk-radio-fueled backlash over ''amnesty'' -- granting legal status to many immigrants who arrived in the country illegally -- as well as a lack of political capital on Bush's part and ambivalence among many Democrats and organized labor about the bill's provisions.\par \par \uc2 In late 2007, after that effort foundered, Representative Xavier Becerra, a Los Angeles Demo\u173\'00\'ADcrat, approached Representative Sam Johnson, a Republican from the northern suburbs of Dallas. Becerra, the American-born son of Mexican immigrants, had grown up hearing his father talk about seeing ''No dogs or Mexicans'' signs in windows. By his estimate, his district held more noncitizens than any other in the country, and it seemed to him that his entire career in Congress had been defined by the fight to bring clarity for those people and their families.\par \par \uc2 Johnson, a retired Air Force colonel who spent nearly seven years in a North Vietnamese prison after being shot down during the Vietnam War, was staunchly conservative but not doctrinaire; Becerra was easygoing and well-liked by many of his Republican colleagues. The two congressmen had worked together in the past. ''I said, 'Sam, I betcha you and I, we're about as opposite as you can get, but if you and I sat down, we could figure this out,' '' Becerra says. ''He said, 'You know what, partner, you're probably right.' ''\par \par \uc2 Becerra and Johnson invited colleagues to expand the conversation, and by the 2008 \uc2 election\uc2 , the group had grown to 16. They met often, for hours at a time, and always behind closed doors, to protect the Republicans participating -- memories of the 2007 backlash lingered. By 2010, they had the bones of a bill. ''It became clear that there were a whole bunch of R's that wanted to get this done,'' Becerra told me.\par \par \uc2 The essential elements of any comprehensive reform package had been clear for some time: improving enforcement for those overstaying their visas; tightening border security; easing the route for legal entry to reduce future illegal immigration and supply the work force; and coming to a disposition for the millions already in the United States. In early 2010, the group worked through the usual tension points -- how many guest workers to allow for agriculture and other seasonal employment, what kind of compliance to demand from employers, how many visas to grant for high-tech workers from abroad, how long the path to citizenship for those granted legal status should be and so on.\par \par \uc2 They made real progress that year, but outside the room, the climate was deteriorating. House Republicans had mounted party-line opposition to \uc2 Obama\uc2 's economic-stimulus package, climate legislation and Obamacare. There also simply wasn't the necessary time or attention available, the secretary of homeland security at the time, Janet Napolitano, told me. ''The energies of the administration were focused on the economy, and we were still in Iraq and Afghanistan,'' she says.\par \par \uc2 That fall, Republicans swept the House, deposing many of the Democrats involved in the immigration effort, and the talks came to an abrupt end. The lesson was plain: Bipartisan huddles were well and good, but they meant little in the absence of will on the part of party leaders.\par \par \uc2 That will suddenly materialized after \uc2 Mitt Romney\uc2 's decisive loss in the 2012 presidential \uc2 election\uc2 . Romney won just 27 percent of the Hispanic vote, devastating his chances in swing states like Florida, Nevada and Colorado. Republican leaders and conservative pundits took a hard look at his 44-point deficit with Hispanics and saw in it both threat and opportunity. On one hand, a Republican Party that could not attract Hispanic voters risked demographic obsolescence. On the other, a party that could attract those voters might not need to change much else in its policy platform.\par \par \uc2 It seemed a seductively easy fix. ''There's no need for radical change,'' the conservative Washington Post columnist Charles Krauthammer, who had previously opposed reform, wrote two days after the \uc2 election\uc2 . ''The other party thinks it owns the demographic future -- counter that in one stroke by fixing the Latino problem.'' Also announcing his conversion that day was Sean Hannity of Fox News. ''It's simple to me to fix it,'' he said. ''If people are here, law-abiding, participating for years, their kids are born here, you know, first secure the border, pathway to citizenship, done.''\par \par \uc2 Eight days after the \uc2 election\uc2 , Bill O'Reilly aired a segment on immigration reform on his Fox News show and invited on Luis Guti\u233\'00\'E9rrez, a Democrat born to Puerto Rican parents who represents part of Chicago and for a time participated in Becerra and Johnson's bipartisan talks. ''I have many Republican colleagues, good men and women,'' Guti\u233\'00\'E9rrez told O'Reilly. ''And you know what they've been telling me? They said: 'Luis, let's take this off the table. Let's take it off the table once and for all, or you're going to run the tables on us.' ''\par \par \uc2 The following day, Guti\u233\'00\'E9rrez was at the House of Representatives' gymnasium when he spied the Republican Party's most famous gym rat: Representative \uc2 Paul Ryan\uc2 , who was readjusting to normal life in the Capitol after the Romney campaign. ''Hey man, I did everything I could to be sure you couldn't be vice president,'' Guti\u233\'00\'E9rrez told him. ''Just joking.''\par \par \uc2 Ryan took the gibe in stride, then got down to business. He told Guti\u233\'00\'E9rrez that he'd seen him the night before on O'Reilly's show. ''He said to me, 'I don't want to do it to take it off the table, Luis,' '' Guti\u233\'00\'E9rrez told me. '' 'I don't want to do it because it's politically expedient. I want to do it because it's the right thing to do, because I'm Catholic, and my Christian values say we cannot have millions of people in second-tier status.' I was like, Brother, you and I are going to get along just fine.''\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 Republican National Committee\uc2 , for its part, had convened the Growth and Opportu\u173\'00\'ADnity Project, a wide-ranging overhaul -- the commentariat called it the party's ''autopsy'' -- that, among other things, aimed to determine how the party could fare better with Hispanic voters. In December, Ryan was at the Capitol Hill Club, the Republican social organization a block from the Capitol, when he spotted Ali Noorani, executive director of the nonpartisan National Immigration Forum. Ryan ''talked my ear off'' about immigration reform, Noorani recalls. ''He said, 'We're going to do a conservative, five-bill package, with a different coalition of members for each bill.' ''\par \par \uc2 The White House and congressional Democrats were eager to take the Republicans up on their new resolve. \uc2 Obama\uc2  had incurred the wrath of immigrant advocates by presiding over hundreds of thousands of deportations -- making an ex\u173\'00\'ADplicit exception only for immigrants brought to the country as children -- precisely in order to build up credibility with Republicans for this moment. And Congress wouldn't be starting from zero; they still had the groundwork laid by Becerra and Johnson's aborted post-2007 effort. In December 2012, Becerra approached Johnson again. ''We've got \uc2 Barack Obama\uc2  for another four years,'' he told him. ''Think we can start talking again?''\par \par \uc2 Among the members of the reconstituted House immigration group was Mario Diaz-Balart, a Republican from Miami. In Florida, the Diaz-Balarts are a political dynasty. Mario's grandfather and father were legislators and held other offices in Cuba during the Batista years; his aunt was Fidel Castro's first wife; his older brother Lincoln was a recently retired congressman who had also been in Becerra's group of 16. (A younger brother, Jos\u233\'00\'E9, is a news anchor on \uc2 Telemundo\uc2 .) Mario, who has the bluff, jocular bearing of the classic urban politician, saw himself as a dealmaker who could skirt partisan ruts to achieve a historic breakthrough.\par \par \uc2 After the 2012 \uc2 election\uc2 , Diaz-Balart instructed his chief of staff, Cesar Gonzalez, to open a back channel to the Obama administration. Gonzalez tried to reach the White House domestic-policy adviser \uc2 Cecilia Mu\u241\'00\'F1oz\uc2 , the daughter of Bolivian immigrants and a longtime immigrant advocate who was the administration's point person on the issue, to set up a meeting at an exurban \uc2 Starbucks\uc2  where no one would recognize them. After some prodding, Mu\u241\'00\'F1oz agreed instead to call Diaz-Balart one day in January. Gonzalez told her that any time would work, except for one 20-minute window in which his boss was meeting with a foreign minister. Mu\u241\'00\'F1oz called during that window.\par \par \uc2 After that, Gonzalez pleaded with Mu\u241\'00\'F1oz to coordinate better and asked if the administration had any big moves planned on immigration. Mu\u241\'00\'F1oz said it did not. Shortly after Gonzalez hung up the phone, news broke that \uc2 Obama\uc2  planned to give a speech in Las Vegas demanding that Congress pass immigration reform. Gonzalez got the message: He and Diaz-Balart were on their own.\par \par \uc2 As that episode suggested, the Obama administration and Democratic congressional leadership did not see eye to eye with the House immigration group. In the administration's view, the path to immigration reform ran not through the House but through the Senate, where an\u173\'00\'ADother bipartisan group was at work on the issue. The Senate was still under Democratic control and could be counted on to produce legislation closer to the administration's ideal.\par \par \uc2 The Democrats' ambitions for a more liberal bill also reflected how much, and how quickly, the politics of immigration had shifted -- a shift that occurred mostly within the Democratic Party. In Pew's regular polling on the issue, the share of Republicans saying that immigrants strengthened the country had dipped slightly since 2006. But the percentage of Democrats saying so had soared to around 70 percent. Reform would eventually need the approval of the House, of course, where Republicans held a 33-seat edge. But the administration was proceeding on the assumption that legislation based on the Senate bill, when it was passed, would be able to clear the lower chamber with the backing of most Democrats and some Republicans. \uc2 Obama\uc2 's staff had counted the votes and felt sure they were there.\par \par \uc2 This plan, however, hinged on one assumption: that Boehner would be willing to hold a vote on the legislation. \uc2 Dennis Hastert\uc2 , the previous Republican speaker, had formalized a Republican custom -- now known as the Hastert rule -- by which the speaker would not bring up a bill for a vote if it did not command support from a majority of the party's caucus. Boehner had held to the Hastert rule in all but a few cases.\par \par \uc2 But in early 2013, Boehner was speaking often with \uc2 Obama\uc2  about immigration and giving every indication of being very serious about doing whatever it took to pass legislation. So the White House focused its efforts on shaping the Senate bill, while limiting its House considerations mainly to building the outside coalition -- supporters from law enforcement, the evangelical community, small businesses and corporations -- that would provide cover for an eventual vote.\par \par \uc2 The administration's focus on the Senate did not dissuade the House group from forging ahead. The lawmakers began holding marathon meetings again, switching locations among House offices to throw the press off the scent, with members taking turns picking up the dinner-catering tabs. The four Republicans were Johnson, Diaz-Balart, Labrador and Representative John Carter, a former judge from central Texas. The Democrats were Becerra, Guti\u233\'00\'E9rrez, Yarmuth and Representative Zoe Lofgren of San Jose, Calif.\par \par \uc2 As had been the case in past efforts, the basic approach to reform was no mystery: Everyone agreed it would involve improving border security and internal visa enforcement, rationalizing the system for legal entry and allowing most of those already here to stay. (Polls in early 2013 showed strong public support, around 70 percent, for such a package.) ''The ground rules were that we wanted to come up with something that fixes the problem and can pass,'' Yarmuth says. ''Those were the only two criteria.''\par \par \uc2 The group was under no illusions that it would be easy to get the bill through the House. Diaz-Balart says that Boehner was all along telling him that whatever bill they came up with should ideally command a majority of Republican support, thus conforming to the Hastert rule. Getting a majority did not seem out of the question to Diaz-Balart. A small core of Republicans would be viscerally opposed to any immigration bill. But this group, by Diaz-Balart's reckoning, was not much larger than the group firmly in favor of reform, and the great mass of House Republicans, he thought, was not out of reach.\par \par \uc2 This last group was wary of immigration -- uncertain on the policy details, uncomfortable talking about it and oversensitive to the calls they got from constituents and activists opposed to it, despite the fact that very few members had ever actually been threatened over the issue by a primary challenger. But this mass operated with a herd instinct. With safety in numbers, it could potentially be moved. ''Most people realize the system we have is broken,'' Diaz-Balart told me.\par \par \uc2 Luis Guti\u233\'00\'E9rrez was, by his own admission, not exactly a Democratic Party foot soldier when it came to immigration reform. Getting relief from the threat of deportation for families trumped all else, even party loyalty. He had been a holdout on Obamacare over the question of undocu\u173\'00\'ADmented immigrants not receiving benefits and over the administration's deferral of immigration reform -- to the point of being upbraided at a meeting by Valerie Jarrett, \uc2 Obama\uc2 's consigliere, who asked him why he wasn't falling in line. ''It was an intervention, and I was the drug addict,'' he jokes.\par \par \uc2 In April 2013, as the Senate and House groups were plugging along with their bills, \uc2 Paul Ryan\uc2  joined Guti\u233\'00\'E9rrez at a Chicago City Club luncheon to push immigration reform. Guti\u233\'00\'E9rrez was also seeing what seemed like encouraging signs from Boehner. But he was starting to get worrisome signals from the Democratic leadership in the House, the Senate and the White House -- a sense that they weren't taking the House group's effort seriously. They, along with reform advocates, were focusing all their attention on the Senate bill to a degree that he found nonsensical.\par \par \uc2 The R.N.C.'s Growth and Opportunity report, ordered up after Romney's loss and released on March 18, did not mince words. ''We must embrace and champion comprehensive immigration reform,'' it argued. ''If we do not, our party's appeal will continue to shrink to its core constituencies only.'' Democratic leaders essentially took that language at face value, assuming House Republicans were under orders to deal with the issue. They were wagering that they could get a better bill by ignoring the House group's work; if that project failed, then the Democrats could simply press the more liberal Senate bill upon the House. ''It was clear to me that no matter what I negotiated, they didn't want me to really reach an agreement, because they wanted to go with the Senate version,'' Guti\u233\'00\'E9rrez says.\par \par \uc2 To Guti\u233\'00\'E9rrez, this was borderline delusional; it ignored both the House's longstanding resentment of being seen as subordinate to the Senate and the weak position of Republican leaders, whose edicts about demographic imperatives carried only so much weight with members in safe districts with few Hispanic voters. Guti\u233\'00\'E9rrez told me that when he pointed out to Senate Democrats and immigrant advocates all the House Republicans who had sworn they wouldn't accept the Senate bill, they waved off his concerns: '' 'Don't worry, Luis. Whatever you do, we're going to overwhelm them with such a huge vote in the Senate' '' -- with lots of Republicans -- '' 'that they will take the Senate bill.' It was not a plan for success.''\par \par \uc2 The Republican contingent had its own icono\u173\'00\'ADclast in the form of Ra\u250\'00\'FAl Labrador. The Idahoan had worked for 15 years as an immigration lawyer, which made him a natural addition to the House group -- a perfect liaison to the new Tea Party-aligned wing of the caucus who also had a professional understanding of the issue.\par \par \uc2 To his Democratic colleagues, Labrador's assertive good cheer belied his doctrinaire conservatism. ''Labrador,'' Guti\u233\'00\'E9rrez told me, ''is the kind of guy, if your car broke down, he'd come by and help you fix your tire and get you back on the road -- and if it was too late, you'd stay at his house. But don't expect him the next day, you know?'' Labrador's mantra was that any legislation had to avoid repeating the failures of the 1986 immigration law signed by Ronald Reagan, which Labrador argued provided inadequate enforcement alongside its amnesty provisions. ''The principle is you cannot make the mistake of Reagan,'' Labrador told me.\par \par \uc2 Labrador arrived with a list of conservative criticisms of what the group was drafting. As the group worked through issues he raised, there was something that bothered him: the way the Democrats kept having to seek approval of agreements the group had reached with the office of the top House Democrat, \uc2 Nancy Pelosi\uc2 . ''The four Republicans,'' he told me, ''were told by the speaker and the people in charge, 'You come up with a deal.' The Democrats did not have that independence. They had to run everything by their leadership.''\par \par \uc2 Labrador soon discovered that there was one point on which the Democrats in the group were particularly sensitive. The group that met in 2010 agreed that immigrants seeking legal status would need to pay for the cost of their own health care. The Affordable Care Act had complicated this requirement by eliminating the cheap catastrophic health care plans that low-income immigrants could most easily afford.\par \par \uc2 In negotiations, Labrador insisted that undocumented immigrants would need to be made explicitly ineligible for any health care subsidies whatsoever -- that, as he put it to me, ''taxpayers are not going to be stuck with a dime.'' He even questioned the status quo of hospitals' paying for emergency treatment for undocumented immigrants with federal funds for indigent care, demanding that the immigrants be required to pay off their bills over time.\par \par \uc2 House Democratic leaders, including Pelosi, argued that this could have the effect of sending people into bankruptcy, forcing them to leave the country. If the Democrats were so worried about immigrants' ability to meet the requirement, Labrador countered, they could carve out an exception to Obamacare, allowing catastrophic plans.\par \par \uc2 Labrador's demands created a bind for the Democrats -- especially Xavier Becerra, who helped found the group back in 2007. Among the Democrats, Becerra was now often the most wary of tentative agreements within the group, saying they needed to be run past Pelosi. (Becerra says he was simply concerned about the language being ''unworkable.'') ''His attitude changed dramatically,'' Diaz-Balart says. ''Guti\u233\'00\'E9rrez had been a straight shooter -- 'I can't go any further than this.' You know where he stands.'' Becerra, he said, ''had been fine, and then it was like a switch, wham. ... It was like, whoa.''\par \par \uc2 Guti\u233\'00\'E9rrez had some idea what had happened. Becerra had risen to the No. 4 slot among House Democrats and was close with Pelosi, who in turn was in constant communication with the White House. Guti\u233\'00\'E9rrez himself was under great pressure from Pelosi not to give up too much to the Republicans -- especially nothing that would undermine Obamacare. Guti\u233\'00\'E9rrez shrugged off her admonitions. ''I just found it extraordinary that every time we reached an agreement on something, then we had to go back to House Democratic leadership to explain it all over again,'' he says. Lofgren was more diplomatic. ''Becerra is a very cautious man,'' she told me.\par \par \uc2 The mind-set that Guti\u233\'00\'E9rrez was contending with among Democratic leaders was hardly incomprehensible. They had for years faced total Republican intransigence on any bill that might be of political value to \uc2 Obama\uc2 . The notion that the House could now muster legislation on so thorny an issue was hard to credit; in my conversations with White House and Senate Democratic staff members, their estimation of the House's efforts on immigration oozed condescension verging on scorn. House Republicans had become trapped in a cage of their own making: On the one side they were hemmed in by a constituency and far-right contingent opposed to compromise on principle. On the other side were Democrats who, even when many Republicans did want to pass a law -- one the Democrats wanted, too -- responded with a collective eye roll.\par \par \uc2 Soon enough, Guti\u233\'00\'E9rrez's warnings to Democratic leaders proved prescient. In mid-April, the Senate group introduced its bill, whose generally liberal provisions -- a path to eventual citizenship for most of those in the United States illegally, generous levels of visas for family reunification and fewer guest-worker permits than many businesses wanted -- and association with Sena\u173\'00\'ADtor Chuck Schumer of New York, the dominant Democrat in the group, predictably riled House Republicans. Labrador and the two Texans, John Carter and Sam Johnson, started coming under pressure for their involvement. On May 15, Carter delivered an ultimatum: If there wasn't resolution at the group's next meeting, the next day, he was out. For the first time, the meeting's location in one of the House office buildings was leaked to the press. A couple dozen reporters massed outside the room, ready to pounce if Carter or anyone else walked out.\par \par \uc2 Inside, Lofgren proposed new language on health care. Her colleagues gathered to read it over her shoulder on her new iPad Mini. It was very vague, essentially stating that immigrants would need to pay for their own health care and that if any government entity provided them with services, they would be ineligible for permanent residence. Everyone seemed provisionally in favor of it -- except for Becerra. The Republicans were exasperated. ''F Becerra,'' Gonzalez, Diaz-Balart's chief of staff, emailed a colleague. ''Ugh. Now I'm looking for window.''\par \par \uc2 The group broke into separate rooms, Demo\u173\'00\'ADcrats in one and Republicans in another. When the group reassembled, the Republicans said they were fine with the language. Then Becerra said he would have to run it by Pelosi.\par \par \uc2 Carter exploded. ''I don't have to check it with John [Boehner], why do you have to check with Nancy?'' he said, according to Gonzalez and others in the room. ''I'm making a decision here -- why can't you?''\par \par \uc2 The group left the meeting saying they had a tentative agreement, but in the days that followed, the Democrats backed away. At a meeting with the group's Democrats, Pelosi loudly scolded Guti\u233\'00\'E9rrez for having strayed too far from his brief on immigration. Guti\u233\'00\'E9rrez himself was furious that health care had assumed such importance. At the next meeting of the group, Guti\u233\'00\'E9rrez asked the staff members to leave, which was unusual, and berated Becerra for having made things so hard.\par \par \uc2 It was the Republicans, however, who finally broke first. On June 5, 2013, Labrador announced he was leaving the group, saying the health care issue had become insurmountable and that he would focus on crafting Republican-only legislation instead. It was a grievous blow to the group, coming after it had gone to great lengths -- falling behind the Senate in drafting its bill -- to address Labrador's complaints on multiple fronts. Democrats I spoke to viewed his protestations as fundamentally cynical, an excuse to kill a bill he was ambivalent about by placing it in conflict with the other party's most treasured recent legislative accomplishment. ''If people want to get to an outcome, they can get to an outcome,'' Mu\u241\'00\'F1oz said, and sighed. ''Look, there's a reason why no bill ever got introduced. Had a bill been introduced, the pressure to bring it through the process would have been very, very high, which was why they never introduced it.''\par \par \uc2 Labrador's exit provided some relief at first. ''He's a very emotional guy, and everybody was like, whew,'' Lofgren says. ''It was easier to have discussions that were productive with Labrador out, because people could focus and not go off on tangents.'' The group also kept getting encouragement from Boehner. He surprised Lofgren by inviting her to a private meeting. ''He said: 'Keep this going. This is really important. This is the best chance we have.' ''\par \par \uc2 The subtext of Boehner's pep talk was that the political context around the issue was changing, in unhelpful ways. He was coming under increasing pressure from his conservative flank to vow not to break the Hastert rule on immigration. The increase in drug trafficking from Mexico was giving opponents more fodder. Representative Steve King of Iowa warned that summer of immigrants with ''calves the size of cantaloupes because they're hauling 75 pounds of mari\u173\'00\'ADjuana across the desert.'' And the Senate, by having released its bill first, had given opponents something to push back against.\par \par \uc2 Support for the bill from Republican-allied outside groups like the \uc2 U.S. Chamber of Commerce\uc2  was registering less in the House than hoped. And the memory of the 2012 loss was fading. Members were talking up a series of posts by Sean Trende, a RealClearPolitics.com analyst, that presented an alternate explanation for the defeat. Contrary to conventional wisdom, Trende argued, Republicans did not need more Hispanic support to win the presidency. They just needed to draw out the ''missing white voters'' Romney had failed to excite.\par \par \uc2 On June 18, Boehner stated more definitively than before in a meeting with fellow House Republicans that he would not allow an immigration reform bill to come to the floor without a majority of Republicans behind it. The following week, the Senate passed its bill by a vote of 68-32, with 14 Republicans in favor -- the sort of decisive victory that Democratic leaders had banked on. But in a meeting of House Republicans in the Capitol basement, Boehner said the House would not take up the Senate bill and would instead continue to produce its own legislation.\par \par \uc2 What legislation, immigration reformers wondered, was Boehner talking about? The Group of 8 had not yet produced a draft. The support that \uc2 Paul Ryan\uc2  had communicated so enthusiastically to Guti\u233\'00\'E9rrez in late 2012 was also proving elusive. On Sept. 10, Diaz-Balart hosted an evening meeting at his apartment to discuss a path forward on immigration, with Ryan, Labrador and a handful of staff members. But the evening wore on with barely any mention of the issue. It was the night of \uc2 Obama\uc2 's speech announcing that he had asked Congress to postpone its vote on authorizing airstrikes on Syria. The group watched the speech, hung around for a while and then dispersed.\par \par \uc2 Ten days later, Sam Johnson and John Carter announced that they, too, were officially leaving the bipartisan group, rendering it defunct. They were under increasing pressure for participating, and since Labrador had left and taken with him the group's line to the House's Tea Party contingent, the project's efficacy was in doubt. After all the years spent haggling together in small rooms, the news of the Texans' departure reached the other remaining members via news release.\par \par \uc2 After the Group of 8 disintegrated, Boehner seemed adrift on immigration. In January 2014, he announced a set of ''standards'' for the legislation at a party retreat, but they went over poorly, and even supporters of reform were puzzled by their purpose. ''That kind of fell like a lead balloon,'' Diaz-Balart told me. After members heading into primary season for the 2014 midterms complained that it wasn't a good time for the issue, Boehner announced that he would not proceed after all.\par \par \uc2 Boehner's No. 2 and likely successor, \uc2 Eric Cantor\uc2 , was even more wary. ''He was one of the most hard-ass guys we dealt with,'' Diaz-Balart says. ''He was always fair but very tough on us.'' On May 12, Boehner was in Laredo, Tex., on the Mexican border, during a fund-raising tour, when he ran into Ali Noorani, the immigration-reform advocate. Noorani asked Boehner where things stood. ''In all my years in public service, I've seen weird issues, but this is the weirdest,'' Boehner said, according to Noorani. ''My own guys'' -- his fellow party leaders -- ''aren't even with me on this.''\par \par \uc2 Diaz-Balart and Gonzalez, meanwhile, were making a last-ditch effort to salvage the group's work. For months, they had quietly pitched to House Republicans an idea for a bill that would combine heightened border security and visa enforcement with legalization for many of the 11 million but, unlike the Senate's bill, would offer no dedicated path to citizenship. They were getting moral support from Ryan, who saw their proposal as in keeping with what he had outlined to Noorani in late 2012, the central plank in a series of bills. They got clearance from Boehner, if no direct aid from his leadership staff, on one condition: ''You get the majority of the majority.''\par \par \uc2 They assembled their own team of a dozen or so representatives, including several ardent conservatives, to assist in approaching members. They brought together small groups of members to review results from two different pollsters showing surprisingly strong support from Republican voters and to watch a focus group where voters backed the language they were settling on. They tracked members' likelihood of support, on a 1-to-5 scale, on an Excel spreadsheet.\par \par \uc2 Guti\u233\'00\'E9rrez assured them that they could get sufficient Democratic support even without a special path to citizenship, on the assumption that millions could eventually attain citizenship even without such a path; he had briefed Pelosi on the proposal and she had not waved him off it. Diaz-Balart even finally got a call from \uc2 Obama\uc2 . It felt perfunctory, but at least it was something. Gonzalez had become so desperate to reach Mu\u241\'00\'F1oz by early 2014 that he emailed her during a visit to the White House Easter Egg Roll asking if he could come in and see her.\par \par \uc2 On June 10, as primary season was nearing its end, Diaz-Balart told House leaders that his count of Republicans supporting his immigration-bill language was up to 140 -- well above a majority of the caucus. Boehner scheduled a meeting for later in the week to decide how to proceed. Reform-advocacy groups, including the one formed by Mark Zuckerberg, readied a blast of ads in support of imminent legislation. Diaz-Balart was ebullient. He took a couple of bottles of wine back to his apartment to celebrate with Gonzalez and others.\par \par \uc2 They were gathering when, around 7 p.m., Diaz-Balart got an email from another member. The colleague had seen some worrying numbers coming out of Virginia, where polls had just closed in the Republican primary. \uc2 Eric Cantor\uc2  was defending his seat against David Brat, a conservative economics professor who had mounted a challenge inveighing against Cantor's Wall Street ties, his inattention to his district and his support -- grudging as it was -- for immigration reform. Diaz-Balart dismissed it as early noise. ''We were going to toast,'' he said. ''And then all of a sudden. ... ''\par \par \uc2 It wasn't even close. Cantor lost by 11 points. When one top Democratic Senate immigration aide found out, she burst into tears, knowing that reform opponents would seize on Cantor's loss as a referendum on the issue, regardless of Cantor's ambivalence on it. Guti\u233\'00\'E9rrez called Diaz-Balart. ''Luis,'' Diaz-Balart told him. ''We lost the whole thing. It's over.''\par \par \uc2 Reform advocates scrambled together an emergency effort to counter the spin, promoted by opponents like the talk-show host Laura Ingraham, that Cantor had lost because of immigration, but it was to no avail. ''People got concerned, and we didn't have the ability anymore to keep the numbers,'' Diaz-Balart says. ''They came to me on the floor the next day and said, 'Hey, man, I know I whipped, but this is not the time.' ''\par \par \uc2 The administration read the writing on the wall, too. Two weeks later, with a surge of unaccompanied minors from Central America giving more fuel to reform opponents, \uc2 Obama\uc2  said his staff would start drafting executive action on immigration in lieu of legislation.\par \par \uc2 When Diaz-Balart held a news conference shortly afterward, he was so upset that he had trouble speaking. He singled out Guti\u233\'00\'E9rrez for his help and his ''willingness, when necessary, to take on Republicans, Democrats and the president.''\par \par \uc2 ''It is highly irresponsible not to deal with the issue,'' he said. ''We were sent here by the American people precisely to tackle difficult issues and not to take the easy way out.''\par \par \uc2 One evening in April of this year, \uc2 John Boehner\uc2  settled into an armchair on an auditorium stage at \uc2 Stanford University\uc2  for one of his first public appearances since his resignation the previous September. Sitting opposite the Stanford historian David M. Kennedy, Boehner giddily unburdened himself of his feelings about his fellow Republicans. ''It got to the point where I had to sneak into the White House,'' he said, according to a recording provided by The Stanford Daily. ''I'd walk to the White House, and the right-wing press would say, 'Ooh, what deal is he going to cut?' '' He railed at the ''anything but yes group'' in his caucus -- ''the knuckleheads.''\par \par \uc2 He said that he had been the one who first encouraged bipartisan talks on immigration reform years earlier, and that the House group ''essentially had an agreement.'' Yet, he said, the compromise was undone by his party. ''There was no way the votes were there in the House to do it,'' he said. ''Believe me, I tried a dozen times to bring immigration reform to the floor. I got slapped down by my colleagues, slapped down by other leaders.'' The failure to pass immigration reform, he said, was ''one of my greatest disappointments.''\par \par \uc2 The event made headlines for Boehner's frankness -- at one point he called Ted Cruz ''Lucifer in the flesh'' -- but his account of the immigration battle was notably incomplete. He failed to mention that he could, all along, have pushed harder to bring immigration reform to the floor had he merely been willing to skirt the Hastert rule.\par \par \uc2 By early 2014, Boehner was already planning to retire; if there had ever been an opportunity for statesmanship at little personal cost, this was it. And yet he could not bring himself to press forward with a legislative effort that he believed was in the best interest of his party and the country. ''Our problem was not a substantive problem -- it was a political problem,'' says Mu\u241\'00\'F1oz, at the White House. ''In the end, the coalition on the Hill which could pass a bill was going to consist of a lot of Democrats and probably not a majority of the Republicans. And the speaker never got to a place where that felt comfortable.'' She added, ''It takes a little bit of courage to overcome the political obstacles on the Republican side, and that courage did not manifest itself.''\par \par \uc2 But the administration and Democratic leaders made their own miscalculations. They had underestimated both the likelihood and the value of having a bipartisan bill emerge from the House. Their strategy had been informed by the ace they had waiting in their pocket: the executive action that \uc2 Obama\uc2  could, and did, authorize in the event of a stalemate on Capitol Hill. But this was a rickety scaffolding on which to build an immigration policy. In February 2015, a federal judge in Texas ruled in favor of that state's challenge of the executive order. After the eight sitting Supreme Court justices split on the case in June, the judge's injunction stands, and millions of families remain in limbo.\par \par \uc2 Not long before Boehner's Stanford talk, I attended a Republican Party dinner at a \uc2 Holiday Inn\uc2  in Butler County, Ohio, Boehner's home base in the Cincinnati exurbs, where the former speaker was making his postcongressional debut. As Boehner strode through a back hallway to the ballroom, I asked if he would care to take a few questions on immigration reform. ''Oh, God, no,'' he said. After the speech, he escaped through the kitchen to avoid any more encounters.\par \par \uc2 The top candidates to take Boehner's seat were at the dinner. One had come out against birthright citizenship. Another had secured the endorsement of Butler County's sheriff, Rick Jones, who is virulently opposed to illegal immigration; he posted a sign reading ''Illegal Aliens Here'' outside his jail and sent Mexico a $900,000 bill for immigrants he was holding there.\par \par \uc2 Sheriff Jones was at the event himself, with his brown dress uniform and walrus mustache. He had threatened to run against Boehner in the past. But Boehner was gone now, replaced as speaker by \uc2 Paul Ryan\uc2 , who was forced to swear off pursuing immigration reform as a condition for winning support from conservative members for his ascension.\par \par \uc2 The party had not merely failed to address the existential crisis laid bare by the 2012 \uc2 election\uc2 ; it had lurched in the opposite direction, embracing \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2 , a nominee whose idea of Hispanic outreach was tweeting a picture of himself with a taco bowl on Cinco de Mayo. Speaking with \uc2 Trump\uc2  supporters in Ohio, I was struck by how thoroughly he had managed to fuse anxieties about border security and terrorism -- my questions about immigration were often answered with references to ISIS and Syrian refugees rather than Mexicans. But what also struck me was the extent to which their frustration was aimed at Washington's inability to get anything done, rather than at Republicans' having conceded too much. Unwilling to risk a backlash against a controversial step forward, the party had ended up with a backlash against its own fecklessness.\par \par \uc2 At the \uc2 Holiday Inn\uc2 , Jones was excited to tell me about his role the next day as the introductory speaker at a rally just a mile away, for \uc2 Trump\uc2 . There, Jones would tell the crowd about his three trips to inspect the Mexican border. ''Law enforcement, chiefs of police, we're fed up, we get no help,'' he would say. ''Drugs are pouring in from the border.''\par \par \uc2 Jones had his own ideas for how to fix the problem, he said, but those weren't needed just yet. ''My job,'' he told me, ''is to get the crowd fired up.''\par \par \uc2 Sign up for our newsletter to get the best of The \uc2 New York Times Magazine\uc2  delivered to your inbox every week.\par \par \uc2 Correction: September 18, 2016, Sunday\par \par \uc2 This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article on Page 52 this weekend about efforts in the House of Representatives to reach a compromise on immigration reform misidentifies the birthplace of Representative Luis Guti\u233\'00\'E9rrez, Democrat of Illinois, who helped draft legislation.

\par\par \uc2 National Desk; SECTA\par \b \uc2 Clinton\uc2  Struggles in Florida, Despite Supposed Advantages\b0\par\par\uc2 By TRIP GABRIEL \par \uc2 1,462 \uc2 words\par \uc2 18 September 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 1\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 TAMPA, Fla. -- \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  has vastly outspent \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2  on TV ads in Florida. Her 57 campaign offices dwarf Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's afterthought of a ground game. And Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  is deeply unpopular among Hispanics, who account for nearly one in five Florida voters.\par \par \uc2 Despite these advantages, Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  is struggling in the Sunshine State, unable to assemble the coalition that gave \uc2 Barack Obama\uc2  two victories here, and offering Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  a broad opening in a road to the White House that not long ago seemed closed to him. Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  is pressing down hard to win the state, campaigning in Miami on Friday and in Fort Myers on Monday, after a rally in Pensacola recently.\par \par \uc2 Recent polls show Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  is not earning the same support among Hispanics, young people or white voters that Mr. Obama captured when he eked out a Florida victory four years ago in the country's most hard-fought swing state.\par \par \uc2 Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  could afford to lose here and still find other routes to victory. Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's electoral map is narrower; he must have Florida in his column. But as the most populous and one of the most racially diverse battleground states, Florida is also a bellwether for the nation: a candidate's struggles here often are mirrored elsewhere.\par \par \uc2 Polling in swing states that Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  once led, prompting predictions a month ago of an \uc2 Election\uc2  Day romp, now show Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  closing the gap or slightly ahead, including in Florida, Ohio, North Carolina, Iowa and Nevada.\par \par \uc2 ''If she underperforms what Obama did in '12, she's not going to carry Florida,'' said Fernand Amandi, a Democratic strategist in Miami. A poll his firm conducted for \uc2 Univision\uc2 , released last week, showed Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  winning 53 percent of Florida Hispanics, compared with the 60 percent who voted for Mr. Obama four years ago.\par \par \uc2 After several weeks in which Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  attempted to sand off some of his rough edges and attacked Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  for portraying half his supporters as ''deplorables,'' the share of Florida voters who view the candidates unfavorably is now the same for Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  as for Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , according to a CNN/ORC poll.\par \par \uc2 In Miami on Friday, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  said Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's bodyguards should disarm and ''see what happens to her,'' a comment that could renew voters' doubts about his fitness for the presidency.\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 Clinton\uc2  campaign maintains it always expected the Florida race to be tight. ''Two months before the \uc2 election\uc2 , \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  is within a couple of points of where President Obama ended on \uc2 Election\uc2  Day with Hispanic voters, while \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  has been drastically underperforming Romney by 10 points or more,'' \uc2 John Anzalone\uc2 , Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's pollster for Florida, said in a statement.\par \par \uc2 With 20 million people and 10 major media markets, Florida is a place of vast diversity and contrasts that is a challenging puzzle for any statewide campaign.\par \par \uc2 The traditional playbook has been for Democrats to run up the score in South Florida, with its large nonwhite population, and for Republicans to rack up votes in the conservative panhandle.\par \par \uc2 That leaves Central Florida, and especially Tampa on the Gulf Coast, as one of the state's most contested swing areas. The booming region has the largest share of registered voters statewide, with one in four voters in Hillsborough County, which includes Tampa, registered as independents.\par \par \uc2 ''The old saying is: 'As goes Hillsborough County, so goes Florida,' '' said Susan MacManus, a political scientist at the University of South Florida in Tampa.\par \par \uc2 Within this swing region, an epicenter of swing voters is the explosively growing New Tampa. It is a community of affordable subdivisions reached by grandiose landscaped entrances off a 12-lane highway, attracting young professionals with families. In interviews, undecided voters there seemed uncertain if they would cast ballots at all.\par \par \uc2 Kish Nathan, 45, a computer professional born in India, voted for Mr. Obama four years ago. He has ruled out Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , but is unenthusiastic about Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 . ''I might not even vote,'' he said.\par \par \uc2 Leo Lewis, 51, was reading political news on a laptop outside a \uc2 Starbucks\uc2 . Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  scares him, Mr. Lewis said. Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , he believes, is dissembling about her health. He, too, is considering sitting out the \uc2 election\uc2 . ''The world has gotten so bad no matter what you do, no one's going to fix it,'' he said.\par \par \uc2 Some strategists believe the pool of persuadable voters this year is shallower than in the past, which may explain why the tens of millions in TV ads run by Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  and her allies in the state have failed to give her a noticeable advantage. (Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  and outside supporters have spent about $8 million.)\par \par \uc2 Representative Alcee L. Hastings, Democrat of Florida, said recently that the \uc2 Clinton\uc2  advertising push was a failure.\par \par \uc2 ''You give us $22 million, and I'll produce more votes for you than a damn television ad,'' Mr. Hastings told a meeting of Democrats, arguing that television does not reach young voters.\par \par \uc2 Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's bulwark is her vast organizing effort, currently focused on registering new voters and signing up volunteers. But Republicans have not been idle: Field teams working for the \uc2 Republican National Committee\uc2  and state party have cut the Democrats' advantage with registered voters in half since 2012. It is now just 258,000 active voters.\par \par \uc2 The Florida Democratic Party pointed out that of the 146,000 newly registered Hispanic voters this year, only 15 percent are Republicans.\par \par \uc2 ''I want to make sure I give my vote to Hillary,'' said Valesca Barilles, who registered for the first time with a \uc2 Clinton\uc2  volunteer outside a \uc2 Dollar Tree\uc2  store in Tampa last week. Born in Honduras, Ms. Barilles, an assistant bank branch manager, said of Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , ''I love the U.S.A., and I don't think we need someone to come and ruin it.''\par \par \uc2 After poor grass-roots efforts during the primaries, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  seems to be belatedly getting a ground game together. When he spoke in Pensacola, where the crowd was asked to text ''\uc2 Trump\uc2 '' to a number, some 3,500 followed up on a reply message about how to check their voter registration, according to the campaign, and 1,400 signed up to volunteer.\par \par \uc2 ''There is an army of R.N.C. volunteers and \uc2 Trump\uc2  volunteers crawling every part of this state every day,'' said Susan Wiles, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's state director.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  must find a way to turn out a wave of white supporters who are infrequent voters. The campaign concedes that \uc2 Mitt Romney\uc2 's field staff members four years ago drove conventional white turnout in Florida about as high as possible.\par \par \uc2 In this state of razor-tight contests, every small demographic shift is closely watched. Mr. Obama won 37 percent of the state's white vote in 2012. Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  is falling short of that number in head-to-head polls with Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 ''If she's getting 34, 33, 35 among whites in Florida, I'm going to start to buy a lot of antacids,'' said Steve Schale, who ran Mr. Obama's Florida race in 2008 and was a senior adviser in 2012.\par \par \uc2 Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  could make up for the erosion among whites by gaining with Hispanic voters. But so far, polls show Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  falling short of Mr. Obama's 60 percent share of Florida Hispanics in 2012.\par \par \uc2 ''Against the candidate perceived to be the most hostile to Hispanic voters in modern presidential politics, why is she not exceeding where \uc2 Barack Obama\uc2  was?'' Mr. Amandi, the Miami pollster, asked.\par \par \uc2 He criticized the \uc2 Clinton\uc2  campaign for beginning Spanish-language advertising only this month and for not doing a forum during the general \uc2 election\uc2  campaign with either \uc2 Univision\uc2  or \uc2 Telemundo\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 ''I think it's too early to hit the panic button, but if these numbers by mid-October aren't at or slightly above where Obama was, there's reason to be concerned,'' he said. ''She's going to need all these votes to carry Florida.''\par \par \uc2 And Florida, he added, ''is the whole enchilada.''\par \par \uc2 Find out what you need to know about the 2016 presidential race today, and get politics news updates via \uc2 Facebook\uc2 , \uc2 Twitter\uc2  and the First Draft newsletter.\par \par \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  campaigning in Tampa, Fla., this month.

\par\par \uc2 Arts and Leisure Desk; SECTAR\par \b \uc2 White Guys, Grappling With a New Reality\b0\par\par\uc2 By JAMES PONIEWOZIK \par \uc2 1,023 \uc2 words\par \uc2 18 September 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 115\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 This fall, broadcast television will turn its attention to the battle of the straight white man to assert his masculinity in an increasingly alien world. And you won't need to wait until the first presidential debate to see it.\par \par \uc2 The male protagonists of several new sitcoms are not as belligerent as the male protagonist of the \uc2 election\uc2 . (A possible exception: the one who wields a broadsword.) But they are besieged. At home and in the office, they find themselves struggling to prove that they matter in a world they no longer exclusively run.\par \par \uc2 For a while now, the energy in cable and streaming-TV comedy has been about diversity, inclusion and change: the female president of ''Veep,'' the transgender matriarch in ''Transparent,'' the melting pot of ''Master of None.'' Comedy built around women has been especially vibrant, including ''Broad City,'' ''Lady Dynamite'' and \uc2 HBO\uc2 's coming ''Insecure,'' from Issa Rae of the ''Awkward Black Girl'' online series.\par \par \uc2 But on new fall sitcoms like \uc2 CBS\uc2 's ''Man With a Plan,'' ''The Great Indoors'' and ''Kevin Can Wait,'' the male leads are adjusting to new roles or reduced circumstances. Fox's ''Son of Zorn'' renders the idea of the throwback man as an actual cartoon.\par \par \uc2 ''Man With a Plan'' has the most overt gender-role focus: Matt LeBlanc plays Adam, a contractor who agrees to become primary caregiver to the children when his wife goes back to work. He quickly regrets it. He's stressed and out of his depth. At his daughter's school drop-off, he's the only father -- except for one stay-at-home dad, a nerdy, neutered cautionary tale who seems to have left his Y chromosome in the minivan. ''It's so great to connect on a masculine level again,'' he says, pitiably, when Adam offhandedly mentions beer. (All these details, at least, are in the original version of the pilot, which is being reshot before air, with the same premise.)\par \par \uc2 Sitcoms, of course, have been exploring men's social roles as long as they've had roles for men. A few seasons ago, a spate of network sitcoms were premised on what I then called ''manxiety'' -- the idea that men were losing their place in a de-masculinized world. In the most drastic example, ABC's ''Work It,'' two unemployed friends dressed up in drag after finding no one willing to hire men.\par \par \uc2 This season's shows often focus not so much on the gender gap as on the yawning chasm between the protagonists' sense of self-worth and a new reality.\par \par \uc2 In ''The Great Indoors,'' that conflict is a battle of generations. Jack (Joel McHale), a legendary outdoors journalist, is recalled to his magazine's headquarters when it kills its print edition and goes digital.\par \par \uc2 Jack is used to finding stories in the wild. His millennial co-workers -- he calls them ''the digital day care division'' -- would rather stay inside and write listicles. He used to track bears; they bring emotional support animals to work. In case the pandering these-coddled-kids-today point isn't clear enough, one of his officemates proudly displays a soccer participation trophy.\par \par \uc2 ''Son of Zorn'' takes that kind of contrast -- the primal manly man in a world of digital abstractions and safe spaces -- and turns it into an absurdist cartoon. Or half of one: Jason Sudeikis voices the animated character Zorn, a He-Man-esque warrior who shows up in live-action Orange County, Calif., to reconnect with his ex-wife and teenage son.\par \par \uc2 Zorn discovers to his horror that his ''little bone crusher'' son is now a mild-mannered vegetarian who enjoys kale juice. (''You know what I drink?'' Zorn tells him. ''The blood of my fallen enemies from the skulls of their children!'') To become a father to him, Zorn must learn to live in a world where you can't solve your problems by chopping them in half. It's a wild premise, but at heart, it, too, is about the troubles of a unreconstructed man in an overcivilized time.\par \par \uc2 On ''Kevin Can Wait,'' the title character (Kevin James) has a more familiar challenge of adjustment: He's a newly retired cop. But his dreams of idle fun are upset when he learns that his daughter is planning to drop out of college to support her fianc\u233\'00\'E9, an effete app designer who carries himself like a Belle and Sebastian song come to life.\par \par \uc2 Once again, the conflict is Man vs. Nerd, analog vs. digital. But as irritated as Kevin acts, the decision he reaches -- to find another job so his daughter can afford to stay in school -- revives a part of him that was already wilting in retirement. He's a provider once more.\par \par \uc2 ''Kevin Can Wait'' and the other sitcoms are resolutely apolitical. But they have come along just as the campaign is stirring up operatic male angst over being left behind by history, as captured by the viral roadside sign that warned of Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's ''vagenda of manocide.''\par \par \uc2 At least, these sitcoms suggest a more upbeat response to this type of anxiety: a reassurance that these characters, and their equivalents in the audience, still have a place in the world.\par \par \uc2 This comes through loud and clear at the end of the ''Kevin Can Wait'' pilot, in which Kevin gets to enjoy one of the treats he was looking forward to in retirement: a zany combined paintball war and go-kart fight with his old work buddies. He rolls across the finish line, paint-spattered but in the lead, a big kid and a new man.\par \par \uc2 He may be navigating a perplexing, comical course, but in the end, the show says, he's still No. 1. ''Yeah, baby!'' he roars. ''I win!''\par \par \uc2 Clockwise from top, Matt LeBlanc in ''Man With a Plan''; from left, Christine Ko, Shaun Brown, Christopher Mintz-Plasse, Joel McHale and Susannah Fielding in ''The Great Indoors''; Kevin James and Erinn Hayes in ''Kevin Can Wait.''

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Working mothers, take note: You have won the culture war. Now you are making advances in the policy battle. This presidential race has become, at least in part, a debate over how best to help you balance work and home, not whether you should be working at all.\par \par \uc2 On Tuesday, \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2  became the first Republican presidential candidate to put forward a proposal that, he says, would give all mothers paid leave for the birth of a new child. He would guarantee six weeks, run through the existing unemployment insurance program, and he would pay for it by eliminating fraud in that system. The plan is deeply flawed -- and, because it focuses only on mothers and offers nothing to fathers, could end up hurting working women. But it is significant that he decided to offer it at all.\par \par \uc2 Any discussion of paid leave in a presidential campaign is a recent phenomenon. The first time the issue was raised prominently by a candidate was when \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  made her initial run at the White House, in the 2008 \uc2 election\uc2 , and proposed a goal of paid family leave for all Americans by 2016. It wasn't a winning issue then and certainly hadn't come close to being a winning issue before.\par \par \uc2 The 1980s and 1990s were full of working-mom fearmongering. The media jumped on scare studies and stories about day care centers harming children -- including claims of satanic rituals and sexual abuse -- and blamed mothers for disrupting children's development. TV and radio hosts urged women to stay home with the kids. Movies like ''Mrs. Doubtfire'' made working women out to be cold. In a speech to the 1992 Republican National Convention, Marilyn Quayle argued, ''women do not wish to be liberated from their essential natures as women.''\par \par \uc2 Policies to help working parents balance family and career were similarly divisive. The Family and Medical Leave Act, which today guarantees just 12 weeks of unpaid leave, was introduced in Congress regularly for a decade before it became law in 1993. President George H.W. Bush vetoed it twice. Conservatives continually denounced it, arguing that it would destroy the free market and the family; a Republican congressman at the time called it ''nothing short of Europeanization -- a polite term for socialism.''\par \par \uc2 Democrats weren't completely afraid of work and family issues. The first thing President \uc2 Bill \uc2 Clinton\uc2  signed into law was the Family and Medical Leave Act. He also expanded some child care assistance for low-income families.\par \par \uc2 But the issue of paid family leave rarely came up for the next decade and a half.\par \par \uc2 The political challenge for these policies is that the constituencies can be fleeting. For one thing, Americans may not even be aware that virtually every other country guarantees paid maternity leave, and most developed ones include fathers, but we don't. It is often not until people are themselves thinking of starting a family that they realize how threadbare the safety net for working parents really is. And once they start their families, their energies are zapped by sleepless nights, running after toddlers, and all the other labor that goes into raising children, with little left over to devote to organizing for legislation. Then their children grow up and it's not a pressing problem.\par \par \uc2 Still, the issue has broader political salience now. That's thanks in part to the determination, or necessity, of working women. Less than a third of women worked full time in 1979; by 2000, nearly half did. With two working parents in almost half of all families, men are just as much in need of parenting support as women. And for the more than two-thirds of single mothers who work, the necessity is even more urgent.\par \par \uc2 The growing demand has led to four different states creating their own paid leave programs, with a high-profile win in New York from the fiscally centrist \uc2 Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo\uc2  just this year. They serve as proving grounds that leave can work.\par \par \uc2 Today, these policies have huge popular backing; poll after poll finds that overwhelming majorities of Americans support paid family leave, including some Republicans.\par \par \uc2 When he was still in the presidential running, Senator \uc2 Marco Rubio\uc2  became the first Republican contender to formally broach the topic in a campaign. He put forward a plan to give employers a tax break for offering at least four weeks paid leave to employees. He also proposed expanding the same tax credit aimed at families with children that \uc2 Bill \uc2 Clinton\uc2  was criticized for increasing.\par \par \uc2 What Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  has put forward, however, is a world apart. He proposes creating a totally new social program to give new mothers paid leave. It's worth repeating: The Republican nominee for president has proposed a new government program to help working mothers.\par \par \uc2 Certainly his motivations are most likely political, given that he trails his rival by double digits among female voters, who are particularly interested in these policies. And the plan would be likely to backfire in many ways. By cutting men out of the picture, it carries a significant risk of increasing the existing ''motherhood penalty'' and making employers wary of hiring women of childbearing age for fear they will disappear if a baby arrives. The unemployment system is already in crisis, so it's ill prepared to handle a new benefit, and it seems like women would have to quit their jobs to be eligible. Meanwhile, states could opt out of Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's policy.\par \par \uc2 Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , for her part, started her current presidential campaign talking about paid family leave, and she has very different ideas for how to do it. She would ensure that anyone who took leave under the F.M.L.A. also got a portion of their pay while they were off work -- mothers and fathers alike, as well as adoptive parents, people caring for seriously ill family members, and those recovering from their own medical issues. Hers would be paid for by new taxes on the wealthy, which is a questionable policy design, putting it at risk thanks to fluctuating tax revenues, congressional budget games and less buy-in from the people it serves.\par \par \uc2 Like Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  has also put forward plans to tackle the high cost of child care, although her plan would be much more progressive, capping costs at a percentage of a family's income, while Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's would give the most benefits to the wealthy.\par \par \uc2 But the debate is now about how, not whether, to support working parents. Instead of being frowned at by Marilyn Quayle, attendees at this year's Republican National Convention heard \uc2 Ivanka \uc2 Trump\uc2  applaud working moms. ''As a mother myself of three young children, I know how hard it is to work while raising a family,'' she said. ''Policies that allow women with children to thrive should not be novelties, they should be the norm.''\par \par \uc2 Perhaps 2017 will be the year when the rhetoric finally reaches reality.\par \par \uc2 Follow The \uc2 New York Times\uc2  Opinion section on \uc2 Facebook\uc2  and \uc2 Twitter\uc2  (@NYTopinion), and sign up for the Opinion Today newsletter.\par \par \uc2 Bryce Covert is the economic policy editor at ThinkProgress and a contributor to The Nation.\par \par \uc2 DRAWING (DRAWING BY ELENI KALORKOTI) \par \par \uc2 Document NYTF000020160918ec9i0005l\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Tracee Ellis Ross may be working 14 hours a day in Los Angeles on her hit TV show, ''black-ish.'' ''But when Elizabeth Warren says she'll have dinner with you,'' Ms. Ross said, walking into a suite at the Hay-Adams Hotel in Washington, ''you get on a plane. I have a million questions for her.''\par \par \uc2 And from the moment Senator Warren entered the lobby, friendly to all but racewalking toward the elevator, she was happy to offer answers: breaking down complex problems into plain-spoken choices, engaging everyone in sight. When a woman on the elevator said, ''You look familiar,'' Ms. Warren introduced herself, shook her hand and asked how her evening was going.\par \par \uc2 Of course, Ms. Warren, 67, comes by teaching naturally. A law professor for over 30 years, most recently at Harvard, she specialized in bankruptcy and commercial law. A strong advocate of consumer protection, she conceived and fought for the \uc2 Consumer Financial Protection Bureau\uc2  under the Dodd-Frank Act of 2010.\par \par \uc2 Two years later, the political novice was elected a United States senator from Massachusetts. Ms. Warren has since emerged as a very popular figure in the Democratic Party and a fierce advocate for the middle class. In June, she endorsed \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  for president, and has gone toe-to-toe with \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2  in a series of fiery \uc2 Twitter\uc2  exchanges.\par \par \uc2 Ms. Ross, 43, has also established herself as a powerful advocate, particularly for self-esteem among black girls in a series of TV specials, ''Black Girls Rock,'' and through social media. For eight seasons, beginning in 2000, she starred in the sitcom ''Girlfriends,'' for which she won two NAACP Image Awards.\par \par \uc2 But her greatest exposure and acclaim have come with her starring role on ''black-ish,'' about an extended African-American family, whose third season begins on Wednesday. For her performance, Ms. Ross was nominated for an Emmy for lead actress in a comedy. She is the first African-American woman to be nominated in the category in 30 years, and only the fifth in Emmy history. (The Emmys will be televised Sunday.)\par \par \uc2 Over dinner at the Hay-Adams last week, at a table overlooking the White House, a beet salad and risotto for Ms. Warren and a green salad and arctic char for Ms. Ross, the women spoke freely on a range of subjects: the coming \uc2 election\uc2 , their family dynamics and a plan for engaging discouraged fellow citizens.\par \par \uc2 Philip Galanes: You're both striking rare notes in the culture. Tracee's show is about a black family facing real-world problems. It's one of a kind. And the senator is on fire on the campaign trail. But there's very little of the usual criticism. Why are we so receptive to you now?\par \par \uc2 Tracee Ellis Ross: It's hard to answer about myself, but there's a ''we'' in the way the senator speaks. She's right there with us. That's something ''black-ish'' does, too. We're not looking, objectifyingly, at this family. We're on the inside with them. Maybe that's why everybody likes you.\par \par \uc2 Elizabeth Warren: Trust me, they don't. I was thinking of how your character on ''black-ish'' gets to an essential truth. She's this enormously well-put-together woman, right? She's a doctor; she saves lives. And she's not taking flak from anyone. Except when one of her children makes her think she's not a good mother. Vulnerability underlies everything we care about. We put so much effort into being strong and independent, but at heart, we're all just working to keep it together. And I don't just mean the working mom thing.\par \par \uc2 TER: No, it's a human thing.\par \par \uc2 EW: That's the part of my job that scares me the most: that I'll miss an opportunity to make a change that would have helped. It's not whether I win or lose. It's knowing how much people out there are smashed up against the windshield. So, can we find a place to put a little more security in the system, to help folks be less likely to get cheated?\par \par \uc2 PG: It sounds like a lot of pressure.\par \par \uc2 EW: No, I wake up most mornings, and in that instant before you open your eyes, I think: What do I get to do today? Who do I get to push?\par \par \uc2 TER: I'm trying to think of this in terms of race. As a woman of color, we're raised to know we have to be twice as good. But because of who my mom is [Diana Ross] and the opportunities I've been given, I think my struggle has been more: How can I expand the ways in which we're seen?\par \par \uc2 PG: One reason you're both such powerful advocates -- for the middle class, for self-esteem -- is that you've fused who you are with the issues you care about.\par \par \uc2 EW: Well, I know who I am, and I know what I fight for. Whether we're talking about making college a little more affordable -- or health care or social security -- I want to be as sharp as I can be because I know how tough things are. That's my opportunity now.\par \par \uc2 PG: It reminds me of your great line: ''I was brought up on the ragged edge of the middle class.'' What made it ''ragged''?\par \par \uc2 EW: Because it was so hard to hold on to. My mother clung to it -- ''We are middle class'' -- because our grasp was so tenuous. There were times we were and times we weren't.\par \par \uc2 TER: I feel like I'm on the inside for the first time. Inside the castle. I have an Emmy nomination! And I've been in this career a long time. I'm 43, not some ing\u233\'00\'E9nue who just stumbled into this. Much of my role has been as an advocate for self-esteem and humanity. The beauty of my work is that I get to unzip something that people are afraid to touch. To make them more comfortable in their own skin.\par \par \uc2 PG: Did that come from personal experience?\par \par \uc2 TER: I grew up on the ragged edge of self-acceptance, where I was holding on to it, but it was easy to fall off. But as I found my way inside myself, I've been able to accept my own hair, my own shape. And now I get to bring that to other people.\par \par \uc2 PG: It's funny. When people hear you're Diana Ross's daughter, they probably start fantasizing about living in castles with Michael Jackson on speed dial. But when you were born, your mom was probably just 10 years from the ragged edge herself.\par \par \uc2 TER: They have fantasies about what's happening in our world right now. But my mother is an international treasure, and royalty in the black community, because she did something that didn't exist at a time when it didn't happen. She paved her own road. And being her daughter, people loved me just because I was part of her. But from a very young age, I wanted to fill that space with something that was worthy of being looked at.\par \par \uc2 EW: I love that. You saw you had opportunity, but rather than just saying ''Lucky me,'' you said, ''What can I do with it that expands opportunity for others?''\par \par \uc2 TER: That was the deal for me.\par \par \uc2 PG: Was the tenuousness of your lives as girls, whether material or emotional, what sent you into the world with such gusto? Go get it!\par \par \uc2 EW: No, no, no. It's the other way around. It's fragile. Security is something you can work for, but in our family, it was elusive. So the way I internalized it as a child was to see that sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't. There were times Daddy had a salary, and we were O.K. And then Daddy had a heart attack, and it all turned upside-down: no money coming in, the bills stacking up, we lose the family car.\par \par \uc2 TER: How old were you?\par \par \uc2 EW: I was 12. I remember my mother and my Aunt Bee going to look at rent houses because we were going to lose our home. I'd hear my mother crying at night, and I noticed my parents started sleeping in separate rooms.\par \par \uc2 PG: I thought only gay kids were so vigilant, reading every little sign. But you did, too.\par \par \uc2 EW: That's right.\par \par \uc2 TER: And so did I. But I didn't have your childhood or yours, either.\par \par \uc2 EW: But this is what art does. It's what you do, Tracee. You help us hear and understand our own human stories. And this ties straight into politics. Go listen to these guys on the floor of the Senate talking about people who are losing their homes, describing them like you'd talk about furniture that should be tossed out. It's a ''they'' that's so far away.\par \par \uc2 TER: But it's not just in politics. It's everywhere. This ''otherness'' that's all of a sudden part of our culture. People grabbing on to what's theirs out of fear it might be taken away.\par \par \uc2 EW: I think it's deliberately political. People across America now understand there's a lot that's broken. People feel like I did when I was 12 years old: ''I'm about to lose the whole thing.'' And they feel that way because it's true. Millions of people were turned upside-down in the financial crash, and they can't get a foothold. Young people with college debt are starting out 10 yards behind the starting line. And this is the \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  moment. He says, ''Blame the immigrants, blame women, blame people who have different religious beliefs than you, blame people who aren't the same color as you.'' Because if everyone turns on each other ----\par \par \uc2 TER: Then what?\par \par \uc2 EW: Then the same old system that keeps billionaires on top stays right where it is.\par \par \uc2 PG: But what does blaming do for the guy who's about to lose his home? He still doesn't get to keep it.\par \par \uc2 EW: It's a zero-sum game. There's one piece of bread here. And if you've got more, I've got less. But there's no more bread. That was not America. We were building an America that said, ''If we educate all our kids, we'll actually make more.''\par \par \uc2 TER: There's enough sun for everyone.\par \par \uc2 EW: We went from a world that said, ''We can increase opportunity for everyone,'' not that we were trying to. Go back to the '30s and '40s, with gays deeply in the closet, and African-Americans with fewer opportunities than whites and Latinos and women getting shut out of lots of things. But we embraced the idea that we could all pitch in, through government, and expand opportunity. And when the civil rights movement kicks in, we're expanding to more and more people. We're not perfect, but we're on the right road. Then starting in the Reagan years, we see a different description of America: Only invest in those at the top, and let trickle-down economics take care of everyone else.\par \par \uc2 PG: But we've had 30 years of proof that trickle-down economics doesn't work. Why does the G.O.P. still push it? Why do working-class voters still go for it?\par \par \uc2 EW: I blame Democrats big time. I don't think we've offered a clear alternative story of how we build a future together. I believe in the competition of ideas. Let's get out there and explain, at a human level, what it means if America becomes a zero-sum world. It's not enough to say, ''stupid wall, stupid wall.'' O.K., we get ''stupid wall.'' So what's the plan? And if the answer is, ''blah, blah, blah,'' then shame on us.\par \par \uc2 TER: Because there has to be a real answer.\par \par \uc2 EW: It's not enough to say, ''Hey, look, I have a 17-point plan that's going to fix everything.'' It's also got to say, ''I get that it's broken out there, and I will bust my tail every day to try to fix it.''\par \par \uc2 TER: I'm baffled by the people who say, ''I'm just not going to vote.''\par \par \uc2 EW: Please don't say that while I have food in my mouth.\par \par \uc2 TER: But there are way too many people who aren't connected. They're so connected to \uc2 Instagram\uc2  or ----\par \par \uc2 EW: Oh, wait! Where's my phone? I Snapchat with my granddaughters. Can I take a picture with you? They'll love it. And I'll forget unless we do it while I'm thinking of it.\par \par \uc2 [They take a selfie on the senator's phone.]\par \par \uc2 PG: Your stock is going through the roof, Granny Warren!\par \par \uc2 EW: It's why it's so much fun to do this with someone whose show reaches millions of people across this country.\par \par \uc2 TER: The fact that you even knew my name kind of blew me away.\par \par \uc2 EW: Now is a moment for change in this country, and when I watch a show like ''black-ish,'' I'm even more optimistic. It tells me we're pushing the conversation in a warm and human direction that really is about expanding our view of who we can be and who are friends are.\par \par \uc2 PG: Senator, you've endorsed \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 . But there's a lot of resistance to her, especially among young voters. What do you make of that?\par \par \uc2 EW: It's not about a single person. We are not going to make change by finding one person with the magic insight.\par \par \uc2 TER: Change comes by galvanizing lots of connections.\par \par \uc2 EW: When many, many of us say, ''We're not going to do it like that anymore.'' I'm from Massachusetts. Ten years ago in Massachusetts, there was no marriage-equality law. Then the Supreme Court of Massachusetts said: Equal marriage. You can marry whoever you love. And all around the country -- whoa! -- state legislatures said, ''We're going to shut that down.'' But 10 years later, we live in a country where people can marry who they love in every state. Have we won every battle? No, but we made change against great resistance. It wasn't because it was gravity's time. It happened because we found something essential in our humanity. When our brothers and sisters came out of the closet, we weren't talking about ''they.'' We were talking about ''us.'' These are our hearts; this is our love.\par \par \uc2 TER: It's like the episode we did on police brutality. There's a lot going on in this country, right now, around the lives of black people. And I'm grateful to work on a show that could bring such an important human story to the audience as part of that ''us.''\par \par \uc2 EW: And the writers and producers and the whole ensemble that makes it happen, they told a story that touched people's hearts. That's how we make change. By speaking straight to people about issues that matter.\par \par \uc2 PG: Like your \uc2 Twitter\uc2  feed, senator, which is outrageously good.\par \par \uc2 EW: And fun.\par \par \uc2 PG: And sometimes very mean, especially about \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2 . You've called him a ''thin-skinned bully'' and said he's freaked out because he's losing to a girl.\par \par \uc2 EW: But it's never gratuitously mean. It's just deserts. I'm on fire when it's time to be on fire. We can't change this world with, ''It will all work out in the end.''\par \par \uc2 TER: Do you ever struggle with it, personally, when it's time to be mean?\par \par \uc2 EW: No, I wake up sometimes, in the night, and think, I should also have said. ...''\par \par \uc2 TER: That's hilarious! Have you always been that way?\par \par \uc2 EW: Let me put it this way: What I thought I could do has changed over time. When I was 12 and we needed money, I started sewing. I put an ad in the papers. I babysat. I raised dogs and sold puppies. I've always been willing to do what needs to be done.\par \par \uc2 TER: You're like my mom. She was always, ''What's your plan?''\par \par \uc2 EW: I'm with your mom.\par \par \uc2 PG: Let's end with something Tracee mentioned earlier. How do we energize demoralized voters in either party? The ones who say: ''It's all too broken. I give up.''\par \par \uc2 EW: Discouragement is the most powerful voter suppression tool in America today.\par \par \uc2 TER: A friend told me, ''I'm just not voting.'' I thought, ''We need to have a conversation, maybe several.'' But these are divisive times, and maybe it's too much to ----\par \par \uc2 EW: You don't have to do so much.\par \par \uc2 TER: No?\par \par \uc2 EW: Nobody is confused about the differences between \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  and \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2 . \uc2 Trump\uc2  is building a future for a small set of America, and \uc2 Clinton\uc2  is working hard for everyone. Is she perfect? Of course not. But you've got enough information to make the choice.\par \par \uc2 TER: So no giving up.\par \par \uc2 EW: No. And once you land there, make a little investment. Knock on a few doors.\par \par \uc2 TER: Make sure your siblings are registered.\par \par \uc2 EW: And my favorite: Always talk to the guy behind you in line at the grocery store.\par \par \uc2 Continue following our fashion and lifestyle coverage on \uc2 Facebook\uc2  (Styles and Modern Love), \uc2 Twitter\uc2  (Styles, Fashion and Weddings) and \uc2 Instagram\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 This interview has been edited and condensed.\par \par \uc2 Senator Elizabeth Warren, left, and the actress Tracee Ellis Ross having dinner at the Hay-Adams Hotel in Washington.

\par\par \uc2 AD OF THE WEEK\par \uc2 National Desk; SECTA\par \b \uc2 Assembling a Rifle While Blindfolded\b0\par\par\uc2 By NICK CORASANITI \par \uc2 713 \uc2 words\par \uc2 18 September 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 16\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 One of the most striking campaign ads for the general \uc2 election\uc2  has nothing to do with the presidential race and is aimed at only one state. It is from Jason Kander, a Democratic candidate for Senate in Missouri, a veteran who explains his support for firearms background checks using a blindfold and an assault rifle.\par \par \uc2 THE AD In a sparse warehouse, Mr. Kander stands alone, a blindfold pulled over his eyes. Before him is a wooden table, the various parts of a disassembled rifle splayed out. ''Senator Blunt has been attacking me on guns,'' Mr. Kander says of his Republican opponent, Senator Roy Blunt, as he props up the body of the rifle to begin assembling it.\par \par \uc2 The audible mechanical clicks and snaps of the AR-15 being assembled becomes the soundtrack to the ad, as Mr. Kander methodically puts together the rifle, his blindfolded gaze still fixated on the camera, his hands confidently finding and securing the hinges of the gun.\par \par \uc2 ''In the Army, I learned how to use and respect my rifle,'' he says, mentioning his record as a Afghanistan veteran and his support for the Second Amendment.\par \par \uc2 ''I also believe in background checks, so that terrorists can't get their hands on one of these,'' he says, propping up the completed rifle and offering a challenge in his approval message as he peels off his blindfold. ''I approve this message because I'd like to see Senator Blunt do this.''\par \par \uc2 THE MESSAGE One that many Democrats have fought to deliver when attacked by the \uc2 National Rifle Association\uc2  -- that being for background checks does not indicate a candidate is against the Second Amendment. The N.R.A. gave Mr. Kander, currently \uc2 Missouri's secretary of state\uc2 , an ''F'' rating when he ran for that office, based on his record when he was a state legislator.\par \par \uc2 THE TAKEAWAY Politicians have long fired guns and rifles in ads to prove their Second Amendment bona fides, but rarely has one shown such comfort with an assault rifle as Mr. Kander in this ad. The commercial also lets Mr. Kander remind the viewer, as he often reminds voters on the campaign trail, that he has a military background, while Mr. Blunt does not. Mr. Kander is still trailing Mr. Blunt in the polls but only by a few percentage points, so despite Missouri's reliably Republican voting record in the presidential \uc2 election\uc2 , the state is far from an assured victory for Mr. Blunt.\par \par \uc2 Changing channels ...\par \par \uc2 Earshot\par \par \uc2 In nearly every Republican primary, candidates vie to take the mantle of Ronald Reagan and fashion themselves in the image of the popular president. And \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2  has often praised Mr. Reagan in his remarks and speeches, sometimes drawing parallels to his own campaign. But a new ad from Priorities USA, the ''super PAC'' supporting \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , tries to use Mr. Reagan's words against Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 . The ad quotes a speech from Mr. Reagan: ''We are one nation, under God; the black and white, we are one nation indivisible, that Republican and Democrat, we are all Americans.'' It quickly cuts to harried scenes of chaos at \uc2 Trump\uc2  rallies, with supporters assaulting protesters, security staff struggling to contain a crowd, and Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  saying, ''Do you know what they used to do to guys like that? They'd be carried out on a stretcher folks.''\par \par \uc2 Targeting\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 Clinton\uc2  campaign has made reaching out to young people and African-Americans a priority, dispatching Senators Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren to Ohio this weekend with that very mission. In North Carolina and Florida, the campaign is airing radio ads aimed at young African-Americans, featuring the actor Terrence J's recollection of his days at a historically black college. He sets up her plan as the only one to help the colleges as a way of setting the stakes, before making his main pitch: ''As HBCU students and alums, our families, our friends have to get registered to vote, and the only candidate running for president who has our back is \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 .''\par \par \uc2 Find out what you need to know about the 2016 presidential race today, and get politics news updates via \uc2 Facebook\uc2 , \uc2 Twitter\uc2  and the First Draft newsletter.\par \par \uc2 Document NYTF000020160918ec9i0004k\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 Style Desk; SECTST\par \b \uc2 The Models Walk Both Sides of the Aisle\b0\par\par\uc2 By JACOB BERNSTEIN \par \uc2 790 \uc2 words\par \uc2 18 September 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 15\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Ivana \uc2 Trump\uc2 , best known as the first spouse of the 2016 Republican candidate for president and the woman who coined the term ''The Donald,'' made her New York Fashion Week spring 2017 debut at Dennis Basso on Tuesday, sitting front row at Moynihan Station on the West Side of Manhattan in a black-and-white patterned dress.\par \par \uc2 Ms. \uc2 Trump\uc2  has made it clear in several interviews this campaign season that she is supporting her former husband. And as a reporter approached, she was busy telling someone else about her stance on immigration.\par \par \uc2 ''I think the Mexican people and all the immigrants are perfectly fine,'' she said. ''They are good workers and good people, but they have to come here legally, they have to speak at least a little bit of English and pay their taxes.''\par \par \uc2 She was not inclined to discuss such issues with anyone from The \uc2 New York Times\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 ''You are not so nice to Donald,'' Ms. \uc2 Trump\uc2  said, adding that she was ''not a politician'' and was here only because Mr. Basso was a ''good friend.''\par \par \uc2 Had he designed her dress, too?\par \par \uc2 ''No,'' she said. ''Roberto Cavalli.''\par \par \uc2 Mr. Basso was dressed in a black blazer, a black-and-white tie and khaki-ish dress pants. And it was quickly clear that he has a formidable ability to show equal love for all the women in attendance, whether young or old, famous or nonfamous, posing for pictures with the young daughters of his more middle-aged clients.\par \par \uc2 ''It's wonderful,'' he said, looking out at all his well-wishers a moment later. ''We have young women in their teens to women of a certain age. I think that's great.''\par \par \uc2 Of course, not every designer in this polarized \uc2 election\uc2  season would be so eager to have the supportive former wife of the Republican contestant for president as one of these front-row patrons, but Mr. Basso had no such quibbles.\par \par \uc2 ''She's a wonderful woman,'' he said of Ms. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , shortly after a quick hello with her, too. ''She was at my first show in 1983. And she's actually been to every show since then. Her children come. We're friends of the family.''\par \par \uc2 But he was not about to say whom he was planning on voting for.\par \par \uc2 ''I think that's a personal question,'' he said, darting off to kiss more cheeks and squeeze more wrists.\par \par \uc2 The political season also briefly crashed the party at the \uc2 Michael Kors\uc2  show on Wednesday morning, but not before a little song.\par \par \uc2 A surprise guest was Rufus Wainwright, who sang a set of Judy Garland songs, including ''Come Rain or Come Shine'' and ''Get Happy,'' with a six-piece band as models marched out in white twin sets and floral print dresses.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Wainwright, who wore a crisp black suit by \uc2 Michael Kors\uc2  with a white shirt that had three buttons undone, did not flinch when Bella Hadid, in her shimmering black dress with bondage-esque platform heels, stumbled in the middle of the runway.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Wainwright simply played on, impressively hitting a high note at the end of his set and then throwing in a shouted ''I'm With Her'' reference to \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  as the crowd applauded and jumped out of their seats to take a picture.\par \par \uc2 After his performance, which took place at Spring Studios, Mr. Kors walked out to give him a kiss and escorted him around the runway like a guide taking a tourist around a foreign city. Then the two retired backstage, where Mr. Wainwright stood next to his publicist, mobbed by admirers, including Mr. Kors.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Wainwright first met the designer roughly a decade ago. Back then, the singer was doing his ''Judy Garland at Carnegie Hall'' tribute show in New York and Mr. Kors, known for his love of Broadway and the Great American Songbook, came to see it.\par \par \uc2 In fact, Mr. Kors had been listening to Mr. Wainwright's album of Judy Garland covers while designing the current collection. So Mr. Kors came to the conclusion that an appropriate way to show it was having Mr. Wainwright perform live.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Wainwright was happy to oblige. ''Even if he wasn't one of the top fashion icons of our time, even if he was the bottom of the barrel, I would do it,'' Mr. Wainwright said. ''Because he's been so sweet to me.''\par \par \uc2 Does that mean he gets to keep the suit that Mr. Kors sent? ''I would imagine,'' Mr. Wainwright said.\par \par \uc2 ''To be determined,'' a publicist added tactfully.\par \par \uc2 Rufus Wainwright performing at the Michael Kors fashion week show.

\par\par \b \uc2 Analysis: Bridge Fallout Dashed Christie '16 Bid\b0\par\par\uc2 By Josh Dawsey and Ted Mann \par \uc2 1,145 \uc2 words\par \uc2 17 September 2016\par \uc2 The Wall Street Journal\par \uc2 J\par A13\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Days after allegations emerged that associates had closed lanes of the George Washington Bridge to exact political revenge, \uc2 New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie\uc2  traveled to Manhattan's Times Square to open festivities for Super Bowl XLVIII at the Meadowlands.\par \par \uc2 He was booed.\par \par \uc2 On that freezing afternoon in January 2014, Mr. Christie climbed back into his black SUV silent and deflated, according to people familiar with the matter. One ally described it as one of the governor's worst days in office.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Christie wasn't accused of wrongdoing in the bridge scandal, which comes back into focus Monday with opening arguments in the case against two former allies accused of plotting the lane closures to punish a mayor who declined to endorse the Republican for re-\uc2 election\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Politically, however, the governor hasn't been able to beat the rap.\par \par \uc2 The Super Bowl letdown began a three-year downward spiral that stymied \uc2 Mr. Christie's\uc2  efforts to launch a viable presidential bid, according to former aides, advisers and others close to the governor. It opened his record in New Jersey to deeper scrutiny, hobbled efforts to build a strong campaign apparatus and gave others a head start in the race, these people said.\par \par \uc2 "If Bridgegate wouldn't have happened, Christie would have been the overwhelming establishment front-runner heading in," said Ryan Williams, a Republican strategist who worked for \uc2 Mitt Romney\uc2  and Jeb Bush. "His star was extinguished by the scandal."\par \par \uc2 Mr. Christie declined to comment. He has denied wrongdoing and said the trial will confirm that.\par \par \uc2 The governor closed out 2013 riding high. He won a second term in Democrat-heavy New Jersey with 60% of the vote. He was elected chair of the Republican Governors Association. Pundits, fundraisers and pollsters all considered him a front-runner for the GOP presidential nomination.\par \par \uc2 Bill Stepien, Mr. Christie's chief political architect, began having conversations with allies and potential donors about the 2016 race and aides were preparing to fan across the country to help with his campaign. \uc2 David Wildstein\uc2 , who has pleaded guilty in the bridge affair, told others at the \uc2 Port Authority of New York and New Jersey\uc2  , where he was a top executive, that he was expected to soon travel for the campaign.\par \par \uc2 In January 2014, a legislative committee released emails that shook \uc2 Mr. Christie's\uc2  orbit. "Time for some traffic problems in Fort Lee," read one from a top Christie aide.\par \par \uc2 After a marathon news conference, Mr. Christie largely went underground, trying to assess the damage and figure out how to manage it. People who spoke with Mr. Christie at the time said he described the emails as a serious blow but not a death knell.\par \par \uc2 Yet hecklers and protesters began meeting him at almost every event, pointing to planes with banners flying overhead and singing songs to taunt him. His approval ratings dropped below 50% for the first time in years; now they hover around 30%. Other candidates began picking off New Jersey-based political contributors and endorsers.\par \par \uc2 The bridge soon became an issue outside New Jersey. Emails showed Christie aide Matt Mowers, who left to run the New Hampshire Republican Party days after Mr. Christie won re-\uc2 election\uc2 , had sought an endorsement from the mayor who the lane closures were directed at. "We told him to take a vacation while it died down a little," said Mr. Williams, who was working for the New Hampshire state party at the time and hired Mr. Mowers.\par \par \uc2 Meanwhile, Mr. Christie began convening meetings at the governor's mansion with influential Republicans. At one in early 2014, Mr. Christie told attendees he had been blindsided by the scandal and that it didn't reflect the culture of his administration. Some attendees were skeptical, according to a person who was in the room.\par \par \uc2 By late spring 2014, the governor began to re-emerge to the public. Aides believed Mr. Christie took a positive turn in June when he danced on "The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon" and received positive feedback, one person involved in his operation said.\par \par \uc2 "He left feeling he still had it," the former top aide said.\par \par \uc2 Over the summer and fall, Mr. Christie spent much of his time on the road raising money for the \uc2 Republican Governors Association\uc2  . The organization raised a record $109 million and won a majority of races in 2014.\par \par \uc2 But that success didn't translate to \uc2 Mr. Christie's\uc2  own political fortunes. Contributors had questions about the lane closures, said people familiar with the matter. Meanwhile, other well-known candidates with gubernatorial resumes, like Mr. Bush, were beginning to jump into the race. And no one had accounted for billionaire \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  , whose brash, tell-it-like-it-is persona was \uc2 Mr. Christie's\uc2  calling card.\par \par \uc2 As Michele Brown , a close Christie confidante, told people: "Jeb took our money, and \uc2 Trump\uc2  took our message."\par \par \uc2 Mr. Christie and top advisers believed he couldn't announce his candidacy until indictments in the bridge investigation came down. He entered the race in June 2015, about a month after federal prosecutors announced charges.\par \par \uc2 The delay damaged his standing among some, said \uc2 Bruce Rastetter\uc2  , a top Iowa contributor who flew to New Jersey in 2012 to recruit Mr. Christie for president.\par \par \uc2 "Had Christie gotten in earlier, he would have been more effective," Mr. Rastetter said.\par \par \uc2 Aides say Mr. Christie saw his best chance of securing the GOP nomination as focusing on New Hampshire, which tends to favor moderate candidates. He spoke to state officials several times a day.\par \par \uc2 The bridge was rarely discussed on the campaign trail. Around the holidays in late 2015, Mr. Christie told people he believed he was gaining momentum.\par \par \uc2 Then, rivals led by Florida Sen. Marco Rubio unleashed about $5 million in attack ads over two weeks that questioned the governor's character and record in New Jersey, including the bridge scandal. \uc2 Mr. Christie's\uc2  campaign didn't have the staff or money to fight back, former aides said.\par \par \uc2 After he didn't finish in the top five in New Hampshire, Mr. Christie dropped out and endorsed Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 These days, Mr. Christie is often at \uc2 Trump\uc2  Tower working as head of transition efforts for Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , giving him political advice, coaching him on debating or holding meetings about potential hires. In a television interview this week, the governor said the bridge scandal contributed to him not being chosen as the vice presidential nominee.\par \par \uc2 When in Trenton, Mr. Christie often wanders into aides' offices and chats about national politics, recent Bruce Springsteen concerts and their lives.\par \par \uc2 He has dissected the campaign with aides and has told people there was nothing more his team could have done.\par \par \uc2 Last month Maria Comella, a former top aide who orchestrated \uc2 Mr. Christie's\uc2  political ascent and attempted comeback, endorsed \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  .\par \par \uc2 Document J000000020160917ec9h0002j\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw272\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4080\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 REVIEW & OUTLOOK (Editorial)\par \b \uc2 Trump\uc2  and the Translators\b0\par\par\uc2 593 \uc2 words\par \uc2 17 September 2016\par \uc2 The Wall Street Journal\par \uc2 J\par A10\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 At the recent commander-in-chief forum, a woman asked \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  whether he would let an undocumented worker who wanted to serve in the armed forces stay in the U.S. His answer probably wasn't what people expected. "I think that when you serve in the armed forces, that's a very special situation," Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  said, "and I could see myself working that out, absolutely."\par \par \uc2 Thanks to the Obama Administration and Congressional Republicans, the GOP candidate now also has a chance to show common sense on the matter of Muslims. At issue is a special visa program that expires Oct. 1 for foreign translators who served honorably with U.S. troops, the State Department or agencies such as the \uc2 FBI\uc2  -- and whose lives are now in danger because of that service.\par \par \uc2 These visas are meant for folks such as Janis Shinwari, who in April 2008 was attached to a \uc2 U.S. Army\uc2  unit in Ghazni province when it was ambushed and Lieutenant Matt Zeller was blown into a ditch by an enemy mortar. Two \uc2 Taliban\uc2  were about to kill him, Mr. Zeller says, when his interpreter, Mr. Shinwari, shot them dead. Mr. Zeller says he knows at least four other Americans whose lives Mr. Shinwari saved.\par \par \uc2 The danger these former translators face is real. Last year Sakhidad Afghan, an interpreter for the U.S. military, was hunted down by the \uc2 Taliban\uc2 , tortured and executed. He had been waiting years for a special visa.\par \par \uc2 Congress should have extended the program for a year this spring, but it got caught in domestic politics. Bob Goodlatte, the Virginia Republican who chairs the House Judiciary Committee, said the visas are an immigration measure under his jurisdiction. He says he supports the program but also says we need "reasonable limits." The final House language allocated no new visas and narrowed the criteria for eligibility.\par \par \uc2 Utah's Mike Lee held up the bill in the Senate to make an unrelated point, so the provision never got a vote. Alabama Senator Jeff Sessions has come out publicly for letting the program expire. That means these visas are in limbo as Congress tries to complete a defense bill before Members head home for the \uc2 election\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 The leaders who should be loudly calling on Congress to keep this program going -- President \uc2 Obama\uc2 , Vice President \uc2 Joe Biden\uc2 , Defense Secretary Ash Carter, presidential nominee \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  -- have been silent. Meanwhile, Messrs. Goodlatte and Sessions are effectively strangling the measure.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  could call on Congress to include language taking care of the translators who have proven their loyalty to America. If Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  is right that Islamic radicals are at war with us, shouldn't these Muslim allies go to the front of the line? Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  would get support from the generals, admirals, veterans organizations and Medal of Honor recipients who have been out front arguing that our ability to fight wars, advance our interests abroad and enlist locals to help depends on whether they think America will have their backs.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  has been at pains to explain that he is not broadly anti-Muslim but specifically anti-jihad. We can't think of a better way to make that clear than by calling on members of both parties to stop their political posturing and fix these translator visas while they still have time.\par \par \uc2 (See related letter: "Letters to the Editor: Admit These Loyal Muslims, Who Are Already Screened" -- WSJ October 3, 2016)\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=wjco20160917000076"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document J000000020160917ec9h0001t\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw272\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4080\pichgoal600

\par\par \b \uc2 Sizing Up the Next Commander-in-Chief\b0\par\par\uc2 By Robert M. Gates   \par \uc2 2,055 \uc2 words\par \uc2 17 September 2016\par \uc2 The Wall Street Journal\par \uc2 J\par A9\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 You wouldn't know it from the presidential campaigns, but the first serious crisis to face our new president most likely will be international. The list of possibilities is long -- longer than it was eight years ago.\par \par \uc2 Here is the world the new president will inherit at noon on January 20 -- a range of challenges for which neither candidate has offered new strategies or paths forward.\par \par \uc2 Every aspect of our relationship with China is becoming more challenging. In addition to Chinese cyberspying and theft of intellectual property, many American businesses in China are encountering an increasingly hostile environment. China's nationalist determination unilaterally to assert sovereignty over disputed waters and islands in the East and South China Seas is steadily increasing the risk of military confrontation.\par \par \uc2 Most worrying, given their historic bad blood, escalation of a confrontation between China and Japan could be very dangerous. As a treaty partner of Japan, we would be obligated to help Tokyo. China intends to challenge the U.S. for regional dominance in East Asia over the long term, but the new president could quickly face a Chinese military challenge over disputed islands and freedom of navigation.\par \par \uc2 Dealing effectively with China requires a president with strategic acumen and vision, nuance, deft diplomatic and political skill, and sound instincts on when to challenge, when to stay silent and when to compromise or partner.\par \par \uc2 On this most complex challenge, neither \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  nor \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  has said or done much to give anyone confidence. All we really know is Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's intention to launch a trade war with a country holding over $1 trillion in U.S. debt and the largest market for many U.S. companies; and Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's opposition to the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade agreement, which she helped to craft and the failure of which would hand China an easy political and economic win.\par \par \uc2 Then there is \uc2 Vladimir Putin\uc2 's Russia, now routinely challenging the U.S. and its allies. How to count the ways. There was the armed seizure of Ukraine's Crimea; Moscow's military support of the separatist movement in eastern Ukraine; overt and covert intimidation of the Baltic states; the dispatch of fighter and bomber aircraft to avert the defeat of Syria's Assad; sales of sophisticated weaponry to Iran.\par \par \uc2 There is Russia's luring the U.S. secretary of state into believing that a cease-fire in Syria is just around the corner -- if only the U.S. would do more, or less, depending on the issue; the cyberattacks on the U.S., including possible attempts to influence the U.S. presidential \uc2 election\uc2 ; and covert efforts to aggravate division and weakness with the \uc2 European Union\uc2  and inside European countries. And there is the dangerously close buzzing of \uc2 U.S. Navy\uc2  ships in the Baltic Sea and close encounters with U.S. military aircraft in international airspace.\par \par \uc2 The only thing longer than the list of hostile Russian actions abroad is the list of repressive actions inside Russia to stifle dissent and strengthen Mr. Putin's security services-run state. Mr. Putin will continue to behave aggressively until confronted and stopped.\par \par \uc2 No one in the West wants a return to the Cold War, so the challenge is to confront and stop Mr. Putin's aggressions while pursuing cooperation on international challenges that can only be addressed successfully if Russia is at the table -- from terrorism to climate change, from the Syrian conflict to nuclear nonproliferation and arms control. Again, neither Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  nor Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  has expressed any views on how they would deal with Mr. Putin (although Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's expressions of admiration for the man and his authoritarian regime are naive and irresponsible).\par \par \uc2 North Korea and Iran are sworn enemies of the U.S. North Korean potentate \uc2 Kim Jong Un\uc2  is building more nuclear weapons for his arsenal even as he develops ballistic missiles that now, or very soon, can reach all of our allies (and U.S. military forces) in Asia. During the first term of the next president these missiles will be able to reach the U.S. mainland.\par \par \uc2 On his good days, \uc2 Kim Jong Un\uc2  appears to outsiders as a cartoonish megalomaniac; on his bad days, he seems to yearn for a Gotterdammerung finale in which a perishing North Korea takes a lot of Asians and Americans with it. Or is he simply continuing to pursue a strategy designed to preserve his rule and North Korea's independence through nuclear blackmail? The new U.S. president could face an early North Korean provocation against the South, the Japanese or us, and for sure will be confronted by a long-term strategic nuclear threat to our allies and to America.\par \par \uc2 Regarding Iran, whatever value Mr. Obama's nuclear agreement has brought, the deal has led to no decrease in Iran's aggressive meddling in the Middle East nor any lessening of its hostility to the U.S. Iranian naval challenges to U.S. warship operations in the Persian Gulf have nearly doubled over the last year. Iran will do all it can to embarrass the U.S. -- such as allowing Russian planes to use Iranian airfields to attack the Syrian opposition and testing ballistic missiles -- even as it strives to eject us from the entire region. Our new president had best be prepared for an early test of U.S. resolve in the Persian Gulf and Iran's continuing regional subversion.\par \par \uc2 While Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  gave a speech on Iran over a year ago, she has since offered no inkling of her views and has said little about North Korea. Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  has said nary a word on the challenge posed by either country.\par \par \uc2 Both candidates have spelled out how they would deal with ISIS, and terrorism more broadly, but their approach in essence sounds like what President Obama is doing now -- with more ideological fervor and some additional starch. Neither has addressed what the broader U.S. strategy should be toward a Middle East in flames, from Syria to Iraq to Libya, and where Gulf Arab states worry about their own stability amid growing doubts they can rely on the U.S.; both Egypt and Turkey are ruled by increasingly authoritarian strongmen; and an Israeli-Palestinian conflict further from resolution than ever.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  has suggested we should walk away from the region and hope for the best. This is a dangerous approach oblivious to the reality that what happens in the Middle East doesn't stay in the Middle East. Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  has ruled out putting U.S. ground troops in Iraq and Syria "ever again." That is a politically driven categorical declaration of a sort no president (or candidate) should make, and it raises the question whether she would pull out the 5,000 U.S. troops now in Iraq. She has expressed no new ideas to deal with the boiling caldron that is today's Middle East.\par \par \uc2 Each of these challenges may require the use of the American military, the most powerful the world has ever seen. The president commands some two million men and women in uniform, and every previous president would attest that the decision to put those lives at risk is the weightiest burden of office. Yet neither candidate has seriously addressed how he or she thinks about the military, the use of military force, the criteria they would apply before sending that force into battle, or broader questions of peace and war. Based on what each candidate has said and done, who can we trust with the lives of young Americans in uniform?\par \par \uc2 Both candidates have a credibility problem in foreign affairs. Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  was the senior-most advocate for using the U.S. military to bring ill-fated regime change in Libya and, further, failed to anticipate the chaos that would follow -- the same failure she and other Democrats hung around the neck of the Bush 43 administration in post-Saddam Iraq. She was for trade agreements before she turned against them in this \uc2 election\uc2  campaign, just as she voted for the Iraq war in 2003 and then, several years later -- in her first campaign for president -- opposed the troop surge there. She has much-discussed credibility issues apart from national security, but these also influence foreign perceptions of reliability and trust.\par \par \uc2 When it comes to credibility problems, though, \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  is in a league of his own. He has expressed support for building a wall between the U.S. and Mexico; for torturing suspected terrorists and killing their families; for Mr. Putin's dictatorial leadership and for Saddam Hussein's nonexistent successes against terrorism. He also has said he is for using defense spending by \uc2 NATO\uc2  allies as the litmus test on whether the U.S. will keep its treaty commitments to them; for withdrawing U.S. troops from Europe, South Korea and Japan and for the latter two developing nuclear weapons -- a highly destabilizing prospect.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  has been cavalier about the use of nuclear weapons. He has a record of insults to servicemen, their families and the military, which he called a "disaster." He has declared our senior military leaders "reduced to rubble" and "embarrassing our country" and has suggested that, if elected, he will purge them -- an unprecedented and unconscionable threat. As of late, he appears to be rethinking some of these positions but he has yet to learn that when a president shoots off his mouth, there are no do-overs.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  is also willfully ignorant about the rest of the world, about our military and its capabilities, and about government itself. He disdains expertise and experience while touting his own -- such as his claim that he knows more about ISIS than America's generals. He has no clue about the difference between negotiating a business deal and negotiating with sovereign nations.\par \par \uc2 All of the presidents I served were strong personalities with strongly held views about the world. But each surrounded himself with independent-minded, knowledgeable and experienced advisers who would tell the president what he needed to hear, not what he wanted to hear. Sometimes presidents would take their advice, sometimes not. But they always listened.\par \par \uc2 The world we confront is too perilous and too complex to have as president a man who believes he, and he alone, has all the answers and has no need to listen to anyone. In domestic affairs, there are many checks on what a president can do; in national security there are few constraints. A thin-skinned, temperamental, shoot-from-the-hip and lip, uninformed commander-in-chief is too great a risk for America.\par \par \uc2 I understand the broad anger and frustration against political leaders in both parties. I have written about my disgust as secretary of defense as I watched politicians repeatedly place re-\uc2 election\uc2  above the nation's best interests. Polls make clear that most Americans are dissatisfied with the two major party candidates for president. But as I used to say in the Pentagon, we are where we are -- not where we might wish to be. We have to make a decision. Perhaps the debates, if the candidates focus on substance rather than personal attacks, will clarify the choice.\par \par \uc2 Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  has time before the \uc2 election\uc2  to address forthrightly her trustworthiness, to reassure people about her judgment, to demonstrate her willingness to stake out one or more positions on national security at odds with her party's conventional wisdom, and to speak beyond generalities about how she would deal with China, Russia, North Korea, Iran, the Middle East -- and international trade. Whether and how she addresses these issues will, I believe, affect how many people vote -- including me.\par \par \uc2 At least on national security, I believe Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  is beyond repair. He is stubbornly uninformed about the world and how to lead our country and government, and temperamentally unsuited to lead our men and women in uniform. He is unqualified and unfit to be commander-in-chief.\par \par \uc2 ---\par \par \uc2 Mr. Gates served eight presidents over 50 years, most recently as secretary of defense under Presidents George W. Bush and \uc2 Barack Obama\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 (See related letters: "Letters to the Editor: \uc2 Robert Gates\uc2  Is Mistaken About \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2 " -- WSJ September 22, 2016)\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=wjco20160917000070"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document J000000020160917ec9h0001o\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 National Desk; SECTA\par \b \uc2 Spot on Ballot Is No Cure-All, Women Say in Poll\b0\par\par\uc2 By MARY JO MURPHY and MEGAN THEE-BRENAN; Dalia Sussman, Giovanni Russonello and Marina Stefan contributed reporting. \par \uc2 1,307 \uc2 words\par \uc2 17 September 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 1\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 On Nov. 8, American voters for the first time in history will see a woman's name on the ballot as a major party's nominee for president. A broad majority of voters -- men and women -- say they are happy this milestone has been reached, but fully half of them say they would have preferred that that first woman not be \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , according to the latest New York Times/CBS News poll.\par \par \uc2 The poll looked closely at women's political views and broader outlook on American life, as well as how the wider society views the role of women. The survey found that women think more progress has been made toward ending sexism than racism in society. They value motherhood more than marriage. They think that sexual harassment is a significant issue in the workplace. And they think the greatest problem facing American women is inequality in pay and career opportunities.\par \par \uc2 Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  is supported by 52 percent of women likely to vote in November, while 39 percent back Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's problems with women are significant: 55 percent of female respondents say he does not respect women and about half think a \uc2 Trump\uc2  presidency would be bad for women. Only 11 percent think electing him would be good for women, while 45 percent of women say Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's \uc2 election\uc2  would benefit them.\par \par \uc2 Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's nomination has done little to reverse women's perceptions of gender discrimination in America, and in many cases, their views differ sharply from men's.\par \par \uc2 Forty-eight percent of women -- but just 35 percent of men -- think there are more advantages in being a man than in being a woman in society today. Majorities of women with a college degree, those who identify as Democrats, those younger than 30, those with household incomes of at least $100,000, and black women all say men hold an advantage.\par \par \uc2 Asked to name the most important problem facing women today, women cited issues related to gender inequality in the workplace, primarily pay, more than any other. Gender divisions were particularly pronounced on issues related to the workplace. Three-quarters of women said women in the United States are paid less than men doing similar work, while 55 percent of men held the same opinion.\par \par \uc2 ''What I see that as a reflection of is that we have a done a good job on the awareness issue,'' said Teresa Boyer, executive director of the Center for Women and Work at \uc2 Rutgers University\uc2 . ''The negative is that it still exists.''\par \par \uc2 Women were also more likely than men to say there is ''a lot'' of sexual harassment in most American workplaces today -- fully one-quarter said so, compared with 18 percent of men. But the same number of men and women, 53 percent, acknowledge that there is ''some.'' Younger women and African-American women are most likely to say there is a lot of sexual harassment.\par \par \uc2 A poll of women conducted for Virginia Slims in 1994 found virtually the same result: Three-quarters of women said there was some sexual harassment or a lot in the workplace.\par \par \uc2 By a ratio of almost two to one -- 51 percent to 27 percent -- American women think more progress has been made in overcoming sexism than racism in the past 20 years.\par \par \uc2 But Joyce Coleman, an African-American from Southfield, Mich., and a retired human resources consultant, said in a follow-up interview that there had been less progress toward ending sexism.\par \par \uc2 ''I'm 71 years old and I was born in Mississippi, so I've experienced racism from several different quarters,'' Mrs. Coleman said. She said that although racism had not disappeared, there is ''a lot more tolerance,'' and she could not say the same about sexism because of ''things that continue to happen to women in the workplace.''\par \par \uc2 The nationwide poll was conducted from Sept. 9 through 13 on landlines and cellphones with 1,770 adults and has an overall margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points.\par \par \uc2 Men are significantly more likely than women to see themselves as ever being leaders in business or government. Nearly half of men say they could achieve this while less than a third of women do. African-American women are much more likely than white women to see themselves as leaders (40 percent versus 26 percent). Likewise, women younger than 45 and those with more education or higher incomes are the more likely than other women to think this high level of leadership is achievable.\par \par \uc2 Carla Lytle, a 52-year-old African-American, manages \uc2 election\uc2  officials at the \uc2 Election\uc2  Commission in Shelby County, Tenn., and is one of the survey participants who sees herself as a leader.\par \par \uc2 ''Initially I was a stay-at-home mom, and I have a large family: eight children,'' Ms. Lytle said. ''I home-schooled them. I think the leadership skills and things I learned at home I was able to bring to the workplace. It's just hard work and being able to be structured and organized and sustain a vision: having a vision and working for something.''\par \par \uc2 Women rate success at work as much more important than their appearance in determining how they feel about themselves, but significantly more think that society places a higher emphasis on looks than on their success at work. Fifty-three percent of women say their appearance is very important in how they view themselves, while 71 percent say society judges them by their physical appearance. African-American women are far more likely to rate their appearance as very important.\par \par \uc2 Fifty-six percent of women think Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  is a good role model for women. By contrast, in 2007, during her first campaign for the presidency, a Times/CBS News poll found that 70 percent considered her a good role model.\par \par \uc2 Willa Speiser, 68, a freelance editor in Warwick, N.Y., plans to vote for her but does not consider her a role model.\par \par \uc2 ''I think she's achieved much of what she has because of who she married,'' Ms. Speiser said. ''I don't think she's a good role model for women because it's not a life path that a lot of women have available to them.''\par \par \uc2 Significantly more men than women consider marriage to be very important. While 58 percent of men said being married is very important, just 47 percent of women overall said so.\par \par \uc2 Most women with household incomes over $100,000, those who identify as Republicans and those between the ages of 30 and 45 said marriage is very important to them. But in roughly equal numbers (almost three-quarters), both men and women said being a parent was very important to them. Women under the age of 30 were least likely to rate parenthood as very important, but still, 59 percent hold this belief.\par \par \uc2 Nancy Brownell, a 74-year-old retired teacher in Houston, said: ''I've been married 47 years, and I have a good marriage. But it was another time. Marriage was another thing on your list. You couldn't at that time go to a hotel and check in by yourself. When I went to college, they locked us into the dorms at 11 at night.'' Today, she said, ''I think a woman can do quite well on her own.''\par \par \uc2 Supporters of Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  in St. Petersburg, Fla. Many said she had their vote but they did not consider her a role model.

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 MIAMI -- \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2  once again raised the specter of violence against \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , suggesting Friday that the Secret Service agents who guard her voluntarily disarm to ''see what happens to her'' without their protection.\par \par \uc2 ''I think that her bodyguards should drop all weapons,'' Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  said at a rally in Miami, to loud applause. ''I think they should disarm. Immediately.''\par \par \uc2 He went on: ''Let's see what happens to her. Take their guns away, O.K. It'll be very dangerous.''\par \par \uc2 In justifying his remarks, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  falsely claimed that Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  wants to ''destroy your Second Amendment,'' apparently a reference to her gun control policies.\par \par \uc2 [Video: \uc2 Trump\uc2 : Take guns from \uc2 Clinton\uc2  security, see what happens Watch on \uc2 YouTube\uc2 .]\par \par \uc2 Presidential nominees are protected at all times by heavily armed teams of Secret Service agents, some uniformed and some undercover, who are devoted to the candidates' physical safety.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's comments were a provocative echo of widely condemned remarks he made in early August at a campaign rally in Wilmington, N.C. There, he airily suggested that gun rights supporters should rise up against Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  if she were elected to stop her from appointing judges who might favor stricter gun regulation.\par \par \uc2 ''If she gets to pick her judges, nothing you can do, folks,'' Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  said, as the crowd began to boo. He quickly added, ''Although the Second Amendment people -- maybe there is, I don't know.''\par \par \uc2 Those remarks were widely interpreted as an invitation for gun-rights supporters to take matters into their own hands should Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  prevail in November's \uc2 election\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  never apologized or disavowed the comments, despite angry denunciations from Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's running mate, Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia, and groups like the Brady Campaign and the Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence.\par \par \uc2 On Friday night, Robby Mook, her campaign manager, said after Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's rally in Miami that he had shown ''a pattern of inciting people to violence.''\par \par \uc2 ''Whether this is done to provoke protesters at a rally or casually or even as a joke, it is an unacceptable quality in anyone seeking the job of commander in chief,'' Mr. Mook said in a statement. ''This kind of talk should be out of bounds for a presidential candidate.''\par \par \uc2 Matt Bennett, a vice president at Third Way, a think tank that advocates gun control, expressed disbelief at Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's ''cavalier disregard for the safety'' of Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 ''No serious gun rights person believes that a Secret Service protectee should have their protection taken away,'' Mr. Bennett said.\par \par \uc2 It was the culmination of a rocky and unpredictable day for Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , and diverted attention, for a moment at least, from his grudging admission of error when he finally conceded that President Obama was born in the United States.\par \par \uc2 On Friday night, breaking from his prepared remarks and turning his gaze from the teleprompters, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  looked straight into the crowd as he made the insinuation about Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's safety. He gestured emphatically with his hands as he spoke, at one time pointing to a member in the crowd to find agreement.\par \par \uc2 ''What do you think?'' he asked about his remarks on Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's bodyguards, as the arena erupted into cheers.\par \par \uc2 In May, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  accused Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  in a \uc2 Twitter\uc2  post of hypocrisy for accepting armed Secret Service protection while supporting some limits on access to weapons for civilians. That post also levied a false accusation against Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , suggesting she supported a ban on all guns. She does not.\par \par \uc2 ''Crooked Hillary wants to get rid of all guns and yet she is surrounded by bodyguards who are fully armed,'' Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  wrote.\par \par \uc2 ''No more guns to protect Hillary!'' he added, although he did not go so far as to say what could happen if such protection were to be removed.\par \par \uc2 Violence and allusions to it have punctuated Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's campaign: Punches have been thrown at his rallies, protesters have been roughed up by \uc2 Trump\uc2  supporters, and the candidate himself has repeatedly deployed a lexicon of physical aggression.\par \par \uc2 ''I'd like to punch him in the face,'' Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  said in February when a protester was dragged out of his rally in Las Vegas.\par \par \uc2 In the past, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  has sought to distance himself from his own menacing remarks by later dismissing them as playful or misinterpreted. His Republican supporters, meanwhile, have been pressed after every remark to distance themselves from him. On Friday night, officials of the \uc2 Republican National Committee\uc2 , which is working to help his campaign, did not respond to a request for comment.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's comments were a variation on criticisms made by the \uc2 National Rifle Association\uc2 , perhaps Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's closest political ally in the presidential race. The group has publicly criticized Secret Service protection for Mr. Obama's two daughters, which is required under federal law, as hypocritical.\par \par \uc2 In 2013, the group released an advertisement calling Mr. Obama ''an elitist hypocrite'' for allowing the service to protect his family -- which, like other first families, has faced multiple death threats -- but opposing the widespread use of armed guards in schools.\par \par \uc2 Find out what you need to know about the 2016 presidential race today, and get politics news updates via \uc2 Facebook\uc2 , \uc2 Twitter\uc2  and the First Draft newsletter.\par \par \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  and Secret Service agents at a rally in February in Orangeburg, S.C. Candidates are routinely protected by armed agents.

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 The latest New York Times/CBS News poll took a reading on the attitudes of American women on a range of topics, from politics to opportunities in the workplace to their overall level of satisfaction in life. We called back a number of them to talk further and also consulted some experts about the challenges facing women today. Here are some of their voices.\par \par \uc2 Karianna Brown, 30, a paramedic from Ambridge, Pa., has never married; she said marriage is not that important to her, but having children is.\par \par \uc2 ''I've seen so many failed marriages and people who get married just because they're having kids. It's not exactly a happy home, and I don't think you have to be married to have happy children.''\par \par \uc2 Marcia Tucker, 52, works in Philadelphia as a program director at the Public Health Management Corporation. She said that over 20 years at the company, she had seen more women enter executive roles -- something that encouraged her to climb the leadership ladder.\par \par \uc2 ''It's been my experiences here and having the ability actually to work for a period of time under a woman's leadership where I was able to get promotions and get equal pay to my male counterparts. It wasn't just policy; I definitely did some advocating for myself. And there were some other women here who were in leadership roles who advocated as well.''\par \par \uc2 Pat Pendleton, 63, a retired teacher living in St. Louis, Mo., said she was able to provide a loving household for her children even though she never married.\par \par \uc2 ''There's no guarantee that having a spouse is going to work out. But when you have a child, you're molding the future; you have an investment in it. As an educator, children have always been an important part of my life. I have one biological son and one I adopted. There are moments when I regret not having a spouse, primarily for my biological son because he didn't have contact with his father, but he was blessed to have the strong support of a lot of family members who loved him. I didn't start out with the attitude that I'm going to have children without a husband, but it just happened that way, and so you move on and do what you have do to. When I realized I was to be the sole provider, I had to beef up my education and work hard because my priority was my children. I feel I made the right decision, and now I am looking forward to being a grandmother.''\par \par \uc2 Carla Lytle, 52, a manager of \uc2 election\uc2  officials in Shelby County, Tenn., suggested that women with children often bring a unique set of skills to leadership roles.\par \par \uc2 ''When you're a parent and you're molding lives, and you walk through issues with your children, it's a 24/7 job; it's not just a nine-to-five job. That prepares you. A lot of people say, 'You have so much patience and understanding, but yet you still get the job done.' And I think you can take that from the home to the workplace.''\par \par \uc2 Claire Goldstene, 48, of Davis, Calif., expressed skepticism about \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's policies and ethics.\par \par \uc2 ''I find her approach to foreign policy often too belligerent. Economically, for me, from my perspective, I would like her to be more progressive around issues of economic inequality. And I do think there are legitimate concerns about the relationship between the \uc2 Clinton\uc2  Foundation\uc2  and the personal income of her family members that I find very troubling. I wouldn't want my niece to model her behavior off \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , just because of those issues.''\par \par \uc2 Lauren Briggs, 26, a journalist living in Los Angeles, said she planned to vote for a third-party candidate because of doubts about Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's honesty.\par \par \uc2 ''I definitely feel worse about her after this campaign. I was never exactly a huge fan, but she wasn't as much on my radar. During the campaign, some things kind of didn't sit well with me. Not only how she ran her campaign during the primaries, but also just general dishonesty in terms of her long record. She's not exactly known as the most honest politician.''\par \par \uc2 Christine Southworth, 38, a musician living in Lexington, Mass., is one of the many women polled who expressed concern about workplace policies that were unfair to women.\par \par \uc2 ''The main thing is that women still don't get equal pay for equal work. Also, I am not a parent, but I see so many moms that need to work, or want to work, and they have trouble juggling work and taking care of the kids. And if they get divorced, there are so many more things to deal with and it's hard. I have several friends going through a divorce right now, and I see all sorts of changes they have to deal with. It seems things get settled more in the man's favor. It hurts the moms, and they have to start all over again building a career from scratch. And of course there is still discrimination and harassment in the workplace.''\par \par \uc2 Robin Morgan\uc2 , who was at the forefront of the women's movement in the 1970s, is dismayed that the battles against racism and sexism are pitted against each other, but has an idea about why some women over 65 think sexism is more intractable than racism.\par \par \uc2 ''That is part of a generation -- partly my generation -- some of them younger, some of them older, who were very active in the '70s. I remember thinking we will have won this by the time I am 35 or I will be dead!''\par \par \uc2 Gillian Thomas, a lawyer specializing in women's workplace issues and the author of the recent book ''Because of Sex,'' a history of the legal cases that changed women's working lives.\par \par \uc2 ''Sexual harassment is absolutely rampant, especially for low-wage workers. As we've seen with Roger Ailes, if it happens with Gretchen Carlson and Megyn Kelly, imagine how much it happens with housekeepers and dishwashers and clerical workers and what have you.''\par \par \uc2 Find out what you need to know about the 2016 presidential race today, and get politics news updates via \uc2 Facebook\uc2 , \uc2 Twitter\uc2  and the First Draft newsletter.\par \par \uc2 Document NYTF000020160917ec9h0005s\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 National Desk; SECT\par \b \uc2 Some Republicans Acknowledge Leveraging Voter ID Laws for Political Gain\b0\par\par\uc2 By MICHAEL WINES \par \uc2 1,373 \uc2 words\par \uc2 17 September 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 The New York Times on the Web\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 As one prominent and much beloved Republican once said -- actually, repeatedly said -- ''There you go again.''\par \par \uc2 Deep in a trove of leaked documents made public this week was the latest example of Republican candor over voter ID laws -- this time in Wisconsin.\par \par \uc2 There, as a tight race for \uc2 election\uc2  to the state's Supreme Court came to a close in April 2011, conservative leaders wondered aloud how to respond should Justice David Prosser Jr. -- a reliable opponent of legal challenges to the agenda of Gov. Scott Walker, a Republican -- go down in defeat.\par \par \uc2 A senior vice president of the Metropolitan Milwaukee Chamber of Commerce, Steve Baas, had a thought. ''Do we need to start messaging 'widespread reports of \uc2 election\uc2  fraud' so we are positively set up for the recount regardless of the final number?'' he wrote in an email on April 6 to conservative strategists. ''I obviously think we should.''\par \par \uc2 Scott Jensen, a Republican political tactician and former speaker of the State Assembly, responded within minutes. ''Yes. Anything fishy should be highlighted,'' he wrote. ''Stories should be solicited by talk radio hosts.''\par \par \uc2 That email exchange, part of documents published by \uc2 The Guardian\uc2  on Wednesday with a report on Governor Walker's political operations, was followed by a spate of public rumors of vote-rigging. A month later, legislators passed a state law requiring Wisconsin voters to display one of five types of approved photo IDs before casting ballots.\par \par \uc2 The Wisconsin statute was part of a wave of voter ID laws enacted in the last six years, mostly by Republican-controlled legislatures whose leaders claimed that cheating at the ballot box is a routine occurrence.\par \par \uc2 Yet academic studies and \uc2 election\uc2 -law experts broadly agree that voter fraud is not a widespread problem in American elections. Rather, they say, it is a widespread political tactic used either to create doubt about an \uc2 election\uc2 's validity or to keep one's opponents -- in most cases, Democratic voters -- from casting ballots.\par \par \uc2 In unguarded moments, some Republican supporters of the laws have been inclined to agree.\par \par \uc2 Claiming Democratic voters cheat\par \par \uc2 [Video: Right, Glenn Grothman, Republican of Wisconsin, said in April that his state's photo ID law would hurt \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's campaign. Watch on \uc2 YouTube\uc2 .]\par \par \uc2 In April of this year, Representative Glenn Grothman, Republican of Wisconsin, predicted in a television interview that the state's photo ID law would weaken the Democratic presidential candidate \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's chances of winning the state in November's \uc2 election\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 It was not the first time he cited voter ID requirements' impact on Democrats; in 2012, speaking about the law's effect on President Obama's re-\uc2 election\uc2  race, Mr. Grothman said voter ID requirements hurt Democrats because Democratic voters cheat more often -- a premise that remains unproven. One of the few verified instances of recent voter fraud at a Wisconsin polling place -- the only kind of fraud that a photo ID might prevent -- padded a Republican governor's tally.\par \par \uc2 'Happy' to deny the right to vote\par \par \uc2 Also in Wisconsin, Todd Allbaugh, 46, a staff aide to a Republican state legislator, attributed his decision to quit his job in 2015 and leave the party to what he witnessed at a Republican caucus meeting. He wrote on \uc2 Facebook\uc2 :\par \par \uc2 I was in the closed Senate Republican Caucus when the final round of multiple Voter ID bills were being discussed. A handful of the GOP Senators were giddy about the ramifications and literally singled out the prospects of suppressing minority and college voters. Think about that for a minute. Elected officials planning and happy to help deny a fellow American's constitutional right to vote in order to increase their own chances to hang onto power.\par \par \uc2 Lowering Democrats' margins of victory\par \par \uc2 [Video: Robert Gleason, Pensylvania's Republican Party chairman, said the state's voter ID law had helped lower President Obama's margin of victory there in the 2012 \uc2 election\uc2 . Watch on \uc2 YouTube\uc2 .]\par \par \uc2 In Pennsylvania, the state Republican Party chairman, Robert Gleason, told an interviewer that the state's voter ID law ''had helped a bit'' in lowering President Obama's margin of victory over the Republican presidential nominee \uc2 Mitt Romney\uc2  in the state in 2012.\par \par \uc2 Helping Republicans in swing states\par \par \uc2 [Video: Mike Turzai, the Republican leader of the Pennsylvania House of Representatives, predicted the state's voter ID law would help \uc2 Mitt Romney\uc2  win there in 2012. Watch on \uc2 YouTube\uc2 .]\par \par \uc2 In that same \uc2 election\uc2 , the Republican leader of the Pennsylvania House of Representatives, Mike Turzai, predicted during the campaign that the voter ID law would ''allow Governor Romney to win the state of Pennsylvania, done.''\par \par \uc2 Part of the party's tool kit\par \par \uc2 [Video: Scott Tranter, a Republican political consultant, said during the 2012 \uc2 election\uc2  that voter ID laws were part of his campaign tool kit. Watch on \uc2 YouTube\uc2 .]\par \par \uc2 And also that year, Scott Tranter, a Republican political consultant for Mr. Romney and others, called voter ID laws -- and generating long lines at polling places -- part of his party's tool kit.\par \par \uc2 Partisan gains\par \par \uc2 Don Yelton, a North Carolina Republican Party county precinct chairman, told an interviewer for \uc2 Comedy Central\uc2 's ''The Daily Show'' in 2013 that the state's voter ID law would ''kick the Democrats in the butt.'' Mr. Yelton later resigned; the party disavowed his statements.\par \par \uc2 A 'marketing ploy'\par \par \uc2 In Florida, both the state's former Republican Party chairman, \uc2 Jim Greer\uc2 , and its former Republican governor, Charlie Crist, told The \uc2 Palm Beach Post\uc2  in 2012 that the state's voter ID law was devised to suppress Democratic votes. Mr. Greer told The Post: ''The Republican Party, the strategists, the consultants, they firmly believe that early voting is bad for Republican Party candidates. It's done for one reason and one reason only,'' he said. Consultants told him ''we've got to cut down on early voting because early voting is not good for us,'' he said.\par \par \uc2 He added, ''They never came in to see me and tell me we had a fraud issue. It's all a marketing ploy.''\par \par \uc2 As for Wisconsin's law, two federal courts ruled this summer that the ID requirement disenfranchised citizens who had trouble obtaining an approved ID card -- many of them minorities who vote Democratic. While the legal battle continues, the state has been ordered to offer an easier way to obtain identification.\par \par \uc2 Similar laws in North Carolina and Texas were struck down this summer by federal courts that called them racially discriminatory. A federal appeals court ruling in the North Carolina case concluded that that state's \uc2 election\uc2  law had targeted African-American voters because they were overwhelmingly Democrats.\par \par \uc2 Of course, no voting system is foolproof. Early this month, a St. Louis judge ordered a new Democratic primary \uc2 election\uc2  in Missouri's 78th State House District. The losing candidate in the August \uc2 election\uc2 , Bruce Franks, cited irregularities in the city \uc2 election\uc2  board's handling of absentee ballots.\par \par \uc2 But such incidents are isolated. And virtually all of them, including the allegations in the St. Louis case, involve schemes like manipulating absentee ballots or falsifying returns that voter ID laws could not detect, much less prevent.\par \par \uc2 The only fraud that such laws might stop -- misrepresentation at a polling place to cast an illegal ballot -- is vanishingly rare. And for good reason: To swing most elections, dozens or hundreds of fraudsters would have to conspire to commit easily detected felonies at polling places on behalf of their favored candidate.\par \par \uc2 Richard L. Hasen, an \uc2 election\uc2  law expert and law professor at the University of California, Irvine, said in an email on Thursday that spreading claims of voter fraud for political gain has a pernicious impact.\par \par \uc2 ''It is a shameful falsehood, given the extremely low rates of voter fraud in the U.S., especially the kind of fraud targeted by Republican voter ID laws,'' he wrote. ''It undermines faith in the fairness of the electoral process, which is the bedrock of all functioning democracies.''\par \par \uc2 Yet it is now approaching conventional wisdom: In a new poll, nearly half of Americans said they believe voter fraud happens somewhat or very often in elections.\par \par \uc2 For breaking news and in-depth reporting , follow @NYTNational on \uc2 Twitter\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Document NYTF000020160917ec9h0005t\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 National Desk; SECTA\par \b \uc2 First Lady Makes Ardent Case for \uc2 Clinton\b0\par\par\uc2 By JULIE HIRSCHFELD DAVIS \par \uc2 833 \uc2 words\par \uc2 17 September 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 9\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 FAIRFAX, Va. -- \uc2 Michelle Obama\uc2  on Friday issued a cutting critique of \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2  as an unserious and dangerously unprepared candidate for president, making a rare appearance on the campaign trail to plead with young voters to support \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  and extend her husband's legacy.\par \par \uc2 Mrs. Obama never mentioned Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  by name in a 25-minute speech to college students in what could be a crucial swing state. But her message, delivered in the voice of a wife who has watched her husband grapple with the formidable challenges of the presidency over eight years, was unmistakably aimed at the Republican presidential nominee.\par \par \uc2 ''When you're making life-and-death, war-and-peace decisions, a president can't just pop off,'' Mrs. Obama said at \uc2 George Mason University\uc2 , near Washington, where young people packed the tiled floors of a student center and watched from balconies hung with red, white and blue bunting.\par \par \uc2 ''If a candidate is erratic and threatening, if a candidate traffics in prejudice, fear and lies on the trail,'' Mrs. Obama added, ''that is the kind of president they will be.''\par \par \uc2 On a day dominated by news that Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  had finally dropped his long adherence to the false notion that President \uc2 Obama\uc2  was not born in the United States -- and therefore is not a legitimate president -- Mrs. Obama said her husband had faced a long list of doubts since his \uc2 election\uc2  in 2008 as the first black president.\par \par \uc2 ''Back then, people had all kinds of questions about what kind of president Barack would be,'' she said. ''Things like, does he understand us, will he protect us, and then, of course, there were those who questioned -- and continue to question for the past eight years, up through this very day -- whether my husband was even born in this country.''\par \par \uc2 Boos echoed through the hall as Mrs. Obama pursed her lips in disdain.\par \par \uc2 Mrs. Obama cast Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  -- herself a former first lady and Mr. Obama's onetime rival -- as the only candidate capable of fulfilling what she called ''the highest-stakes, most 24/7 job that you could imagine.''\par \par \uc2 ''With every word that they utter, they can start wars, crash markets, change the course of this planet, so who in this \uc2 election\uc2  is truly ready for this job?'' Mrs. Obama said. ''It is excruciatingly clear that there is only one person in this \uc2 election\uc2  we can trust with those responsibilities, only one person with the qualifications and the temperament for that job, and that is our friend \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 .''\par \par \uc2 Mrs. Obama has been a reluctant conscript to political life and has limited her appearances at campaign events during Mr. Obama's time in office. But her aides say that the first lady is deeply invested in this year's race and is eager to do what she can to help Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Mrs. Obama's broad popularity -- she was viewed favorably by 64 percent of Americans last month in a Gallup Poll -- and her image as removed from partisan politics give her a platform to appeal to a wide range of voters, particularly the young people and minorities who made up the coalition that elected her husband.\par \par \uc2 Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  has struggled to attract support from younger voters, who flocked to the candidacy of Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, who cast her in the Democratic primary race as an establishment politician beholden to wealthy interests.\par \par \uc2 ''When I hear folks saying they don't feel inspired in this \uc2 election\uc2 , well, let me tell you, I disagree -- I am inspired,'' Mrs. Obama said.\par \par \uc2 ''Let's be clear: Elections are not just about who votes, but who doesn't vote, and that is especially true for young people like all of you,'' she added, noting that voters under 30 provided the margin of victory for Mr. Obama four times in politically competitive states, including Virginia.\par \par \uc2 Mrs. Obama's enthusiastic activism on behalf of Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  represents a stark turnabout from eight years ago, when Mrs. Obama bristled privately at Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's criticisms of Mr. Obama during the bitter Democratic primary race.\par \par \uc2 Now, she and Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  share political goals, and Mrs. Obama signaled in July, with a prime-time speech at the Democratic National Convention, that she planned to put her personal credibility on the line to elect her husband's chosen successor.\par \par \uc2 ''Hillary has the resilience that it takes to do this job, because when she gets knocked down, she doesn't complain or cry foul,'' Mrs. Obama said. ''She gets right back up, and she comes back stronger.''\par \par \uc2 Find out what you need to know about the 2016 presidential race today, and get politics news updates via \uc2 Facebook\uc2 , \uc2 Twitter\uc2  and the First Draft newsletter.\par \par \uc2 Michelle Obama on Friday in Fairfax, Va. ''It is excruciatingly clear that there is only one person in this \uc2 election\uc2  we can trust,'' she said.

\par\par \uc2 National Desk; SECTA\par \b \uc2 Trump\uc2  Drops False 'Birther' Claim but Offers New One: \uc2 Clinton\uc2  Started It\b0\par\par\uc2 By MAGGIE HABERMAN and ALAN RAPPEPORT \par \uc2 1,431 \uc2 words\par \uc2 17 September 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 10\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2  publicly retreated from his ''birther'' campaign on Friday, tersely acknowledging that President Obama was born in the United States -- and effectively conceding that the conspiracy theory he had promoted for years was baseless.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  made no apology for and took no questions about what had amounted to a five-year-long smear of the nation's first black president. Instead, he claimed, falsely, that questions about Mr. Obama's citizenship were initially stirred by the Democratic presidential nominee, \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , in her unsuccessful primary contest against Mr. Obama in 2008.\par \par \uc2 Still, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's brief remarks, tacked on to the end of a campaign appearance with military veterans at his new hotel in downtown Washington, represented a sharp reversal from a position he had publicly maintained, over howls of outrage from all but the far-right extreme of the political spectrum, since 2011.\par \par \uc2 ''President \uc2 Barack Obama\uc2  was born in the United States, period,'' Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  said. ''Now, we all want to get back to making America strong and great again.''\par \par \uc2 Earlier Friday, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  sought to stoke interest in his eventual statement on his birther views, telling Fox Business that he would save his views for the media-heavy event at his hotel because ''we have to keep the suspense going.''\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's embrace of and refusal to disavow the birther issue helped drive his standing among black voters to historically low levels, with some public opinion polls showing him supported by zero percent of African-Americans.\par \par \uc2 Given his other racially incendiary statements, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's aides privately say they fear he will be unable to shake free of charges that he is racist, a label that has stuck to him with deleterious effect, polls show.\par \par \uc2 Mindful that the birther issue could also haunt Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  in his first debate with Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , on Sept. 26, his aides tried for several days to put it to rest. But Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  himself revived the issue late Thursday, declining in an interview with The \uc2 Washington Post\uc2  to acknowledge that Mr. Obama was born in Hawaii.\par \par \uc2 In his brief remarks, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  leveled the accusation -- which his supporters have been pressing for weeks -- that Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  first raised doubts eight years ago about Mr. Obama's birthplace.\par \par \uc2 ''\uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  and her campaign of 2008 started the birther controversy,'' Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  said. ''I finished it.''\par \par \uc2 During the 2008 Democratic contest, a senior strategist for Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  at one point pondered, in an internal memo that was later leaked, the ways in which Mr. Obama's personal background differed from those of many Americans.\par \par \uc2 But contrary to Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's assertion, neither Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  nor her campaign ever publicly questioned Mr. Obama's citizenship or birthplace.\par \par \uc2 The topic was such a fringe issue within the Republican Party that in 2011, conservatives, including Ann Coulter, now a vocal \uc2 Trump\uc2  supporter, called on Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  to stop pursuing it.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's aides, in a statement late Thursday, tried to argue that he had actually ''ended'' the birther issue. Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's spokesman, Jason Miller, asserted -- also falsely -- that Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  had ''obtained'' Mr. Obama's birth certificate; the president actually released the long-form version in 2011.\par \par \uc2 ''Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  did a great service to the president and the country by bringing closure to the issue that \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  and her team first raised,'' Mr. Miller said.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's remarks on Friday came after Mr. Obama, in a brief exchange with reporters at the White House, again expressed scorn for the subject. ''I was pretty confident about where I was born,'' he said. ''I think most people were as well. My hope would be that the presidential \uc2 election\uc2  reflects more serious issues than that.''\par \par \uc2 Two of Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's top advisers -- his campaign manager, Kellyanne Conway, and former Mayor \uc2 Rudolph W. Giuliani\uc2  of New York -- said in recent days that Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  had come to believe that Mr. Obama was born in the United States.\par \par \uc2 But Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  refused to say so.\par \par \uc2 ''I'll answer that question at the right time,'' Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  said in the \uc2 Washington Post\uc2  interview. ''I just don't want to answer it yet.''\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 Clinton\uc2  campaign made clear that it would not let Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  slide on the subject.\par \par \uc2 In a speech to the Black Women's Agenda symposium in Washington on Friday -- before Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  made his statement -- Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  said Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  owed Mr. Obama and the country an apology.\par \par \uc2 ''For five years he has led the birther movement to delegitimize our first black president,'' Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  said. ''His campaign was founded on this outrageous lie.''\par \par \uc2 She added, ''There is no erasing it in history.''\par \par \uc2 Representative James E. Clyburn of South Carolina, a member of the \uc2 Congressional Black Caucus\uc2 , said Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  was making such pronounced racial attacks that critics had struggled to adjust.\par \par \uc2 ''One of things that we are all used to in this business is dog whistles,'' Mr. Clyburn said. ''But the thing that we are not used to, and I'm finding it very difficult to get used to, are the howls of wolves. These are howls. These are not whistles.''\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  must improve his standing with suburban moderates who shrink from backing someone accused of racism. But his remarks on Friday seemed unlikely to make much of a dent.\par \par \uc2 Connie Keys, 54, a stay-at-home mother in Montclair, N.J., said Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  still seemed not to accept Mr. Obama as presidential.\par \par \uc2 ''He makes it sounds like, 'I should be thanked, I should be applauded, because I'm the one who finally told the country that the president was born here,' when in fact the voters decided that for themselves when we elected President Obama twice,'' said Ms. Keys, who is white.\par \par \uc2 The birther issue brought Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  attention and vaulted him to the front of Republican primary polls in 2011 as he considered a White House bid. He claimed, without ever offering evidence, that he had hired investigators, and said they ''cannot believe what they're finding.''\par \par \uc2 Mr. Obama, frustrated by the degree to which questions about his citizenship were spreading and attention was being diverted from federal budget discussions, released his long-form birth certificate that April. ''We do not have time for this kind of silliness,'' he said.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , who was en route to New Hampshire for a political trip at the time, took a victory lap. ''I am really honored, frankly, to have played such a big role in hopefully, hopefully, getting rid of this issue,'' he told reporters.\par \par \uc2 But he still refused to accept that Mr. Obama's birth certificate was authentic. ''We have to look at it to see if it's real,'' he said.\par \par \uc2 On Friday, Senator \uc2 Lindsey Graham\uc2 , Republican of South Carolina, a frequent critic of Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , said he was glad that Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  ''now rejects the crazy idea President Obama wasn't born in America.'' But he warned that this would not end the discussion.\par \par \uc2 ''The problem he'll have is that he was a leader of this movement,'' Mr. Graham said. ''I don't think he did the country a service, himself a service or the party a service by pushing this so hard and so long.''\par \par \uc2 Democrats seized on Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's remarks as a litmus test for Republican candidates.\par \par \uc2 ''He continues to disqualify himself, and yet Republican Senate candidates continue to stand by his side,'' said Sadie Weiner, a spokeswoman for the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee. She said Republican candidates needed to say ''if they think \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  should apologize to the American people for the absurd lies he has spread about President Obama and why they continue to support a campaign that provides a safe harbor for this type of disgusting race baiting.''\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  took no questions after his remarks about Mr. Obama. As reporters shouted questions, he smiled and left the room.\par \par \uc2 Not long after, the structure holding up the curtain that had provided a backdrop for his remarks collapsed, sending American flags toppling to the ground. No one was hurt.\par \par \uc2 Find out what you need to know about the 2016 presidential race today, and get politics news updates via \uc2 Facebook\uc2 , \uc2 Twitter\uc2  and the First Draft newsletter.\par \par \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2  during a campaign event Friday at his new hotel in Washington.

\par\par \uc2 ON WASHINGTON\par \uc2 National Desk; SECTA\par \b \uc2 Why Senate Couldn't Pass a Crime Bill Many Backed\b0\par\par\uc2 By CARL HULSE \par \uc2 966 \uc2 words\par \uc2 17 September 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 8\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 WASHINGTON -- A major criminal-justice overhaul bill seemed destined to be the bipartisan success story of the year, consensus legislation that showed lawmakers could still rise above politics.\par \par \uc2 Then the \uc2 election\uc2 , \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's demand for ''law and order'' and a series of other political calculations got in the way.\par \par \uc2 Senate Republicans divided on the wisdom of reducing federal mandatory minimum sentences. Other Republicans, unhappy that President Obama was reducing hundreds of federal prison sentences on his own, did not want to give him a legacy victory. A surge in crime in some urban areas gave opponents of the legislation a new argument.\par \par \uc2 Now, the Senate authors of the legislation say it is effectively dead.\par \par \uc2 ''I do believe it is over,'' said Senator Richard J. Durbin of Illinois, the No. 2 Democrat in the Senate, who put considerable effort into difficult negotiations with Republicans to strike a compromise. ''We missed an opportunity.''\par \par \uc2 What remains is a stunning display of dysfunction given the powerful forces arrayed behind legislation meant to provide a second chance for nonviolent offenders facing long prison sentences while also saving tax dollars on prison costs.\par \par \uc2 Speaker Paul D. Ryan is on board. The quarrelsome \uc2 Senate Judiciary Committee\uc2  passed its bill on a strong bipartisan vote with the imprimatur of Senator \uc2 Charles E. Grassley\uc2  of Iowa, the Republican chairman. Mr. Obama considers the issue a top priority.\par \par \uc2 The conservative Koch brothers were behind it. So was the liberal \uc2 Center for American Progress\uc2  and just about every advocacy group in between. Polls show the concept has broad public support. States both red and blue already have moved ahead with successful parallel programs. A cross section of law enforcement groups backs it.\par \par \uc2 Still, the legislation foundered.\par \par \uc2 ''It is one of the things that makes this a frustrating place to work,'' said Senator John Cornyn of Texas, the No. 2 Republican in the Senate, who became a believer in a new approach to criminal justice after seeing the benefits in his home state.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Cornyn concedes the tumult of this \uc2 election\uc2  year was a major factor given sharp disagreement among Senate Republicans reflected in the decision by Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader, to not allow a vote on a proposal most believe would pass easily.\par \par \uc2 ''I think that Senator McConnell understandably did not want to tee up an issue that split our caucus right before the 2016 \uc2 election\uc2 ,'' said Mr. Cornyn, who noted that aspects of the legislation had been misconstrued by its critics.\par \par \uc2 Presidential politics were at work as well. Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  has been campaigning on warnings of a United States at risk from sinister forces, even though violent crime is low compared with past decades. But crime surges in some urban areas have given opponents of the legislation ammunition to challenge it.\par \par \uc2 ''I think he's highlighted some of the crime surges we've seen, and I do think it should require proponents of the federal legislation to re-evaluate their position,'' said Senator Jeff Sessions, Republican of Alabama, referring to Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Mr. Sessions is both a chief ally of Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  on Capitol Hill and a leading opponent of the criminal justice legislation, along with the Republican Senators Tom Cotton of Arkansas and \uc2 David Perdue\uc2  of Georgia. Mr. Cotton said this year that the United States suffered from an ''under-incarceration'' problem, not from too many people being in prison. These critics have been supported by an association of federal prosecutors that has assailed the legislation.\par \par \uc2 Frustrated supporters of the proposal have pushed back, noting that even if violent crime is rising in some locations, the legislation is aimed at nonviolent criminals, mainly drug offenders. But the clash created a political dissonance and made some Republicans reluctant to risk their tough-on-crime image immediately before an \uc2 election\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Democrats and progressive groups have been leery of an insistence by conservatives that any final legislation include a provision that could make it more difficult to prosecute white-collar crimes. Passage of a separate measure addressing the opioid crisis gave lawmakers an accomplishment to tout on the drug issue.\par \par \uc2 Despite slim chances for success this year, proponents of the criminal justice package are not surrendering.\par \par \uc2 Supporters have met with Mr. Ryan to press for a House vote on a package of three bills before lawmakers leave for the \uc2 election\uc2 . House backers of the legislation have been conducting briefings for lawmakers and aides in hopes of winning enough commitments to persuade Mr. Ryan to move ahead. ''I think we are close,'' said Holly Harris, executive director of the U.S. Justice Action Network, a leading bipartisan coalition behind the legislation. ''The enemy is the clock.''\par \par \uc2 Even if the House were to act in the next week or so -- a prospect top aides considered unlikely -- there would be little opportunity for the Senate to follow suit, with senators eager to return to campaigning in the battle for Senate control. Neither Mr. Cornyn nor Mr. Durbin sees criminal justice legislation as the type of issue that could be sorted out in a chaotic postelection, lame-duck session, with other issues clamoring for immediate attention.\par \par \uc2 Both senators, as well as Ms. Harris, predicted that the criminal justice proposals would be back before Congress in 2017 if nothing happened this year. ''This is not a partisan issue,'' Mr. Cornyn said. ''No matter what happens in November, I think this is still very much alive and achievable. Some things just take a while.''\par \par \uc2 But this was one thing Congress was supposed to have done by now.\par \par \uc2 Follow The \uc2 New York Times\uc2 's politics and Washington coverage on \uc2 Facebook\uc2  and \uc2 Twitter\uc2 , and sign up for the First Draft politics newsletter.\par \par \uc2 Document NYTF000020160917ec9h00045\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 National Desk; SECTA\par \b \uc2 Once Certain of a Victory, \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's Fans Fear Her Loss\b0\par\par\uc2 By MATT FLEGENHEIMER; Jess Bidgood and Thomas Kaplan contributed reporting. \par \uc2 1,332 \uc2 words\par \uc2 17 September 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 9\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Beside the olive display at Zabar's, that iconic hub of lox and neurosis on the Upper West Side of Manhattan, Linda Donohue was trying to talk herself down.\par \par \uc2 Surely the polls she tracked anxiously were not to be trusted, she said. Surely \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , the man with the garish golden tower across town, would not be allowed to reach the White House.\par \par \uc2 ''We have to have more faith in the American public,'' said Ms. Donohue, 61, a longtime New Yorker now living in Seattle.\par \par \uc2 A man behind her could not suppress a loud snort.\par \par \uc2 Then Cathi Anderson, who was shopping with Ms. Donohue, mentioned yet another distressing poll, this one from Ohio, which showed Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  ahead. Ms. Donohue nodded grimly.\par \par \uc2 Just in case her faith in the American electorate was misplaced, Ms. Donohue said, she had retained her Irish citizenship.\par \par \uc2 For both parties, every \uc2 election\uc2  can feel like the most vital of a lifetime, the one day standing between a still-proud nation and its imminent demise. Among liberals, there is an especially rich tradition of ''bed-wetting,'' as even some practitioners call it, at the faintest sign of shakiness from their candidate.\par \par \uc2 But as \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  lurches toward \uc2 Election\uc2  Day, her supporters at times seem overwhelmed by a tsunami of unease, exacerbated by Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's bout of pneumonia and a slow-footed acknowledgment of the illness. They are confronting a question they had assumed, just a few weeks ago, they would not need to consider in a race against the most unpopular presidential nominee in modern times: Could Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  actually blow this?\par \par \uc2 ''It's like someone dropped ice water on the head of America,'' Julie Gaines, the owner of Fishs Eddy, a home goods store in Manhattan, said of Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's increased odds. ''Everyone sobered up. This could happen.''\par \par \uc2 The creeping dread has accelerated in recent days, reaching critical levels even by Democratic standards.\par \par \uc2 Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  became sick. Several polls tightened to the margin of panic, with Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  overtaking her in surveys in Ohio and Florida. And even as Democrats hoped on Friday that Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's latest gambit -- seeking to distance himself from his long history of ''birtherism'' -- would backfire, there is a fear that no scandal can sink him.\par \par \uc2 A cartoon in \uc2 The New Yorker\uc2  captured it best: A woman sits in her psychiatrist's office, perspiring in distress. The doctor scribbles on a pad. ''I'm giving you something for Hillary's pneumonia,'' the caption reads.\par \par \uc2 Supporters of Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  have greeted the moment with varying degrees of alarm, according to interviews with dozens of them across the country.\par \par \uc2 They read warily about the health of her lungs and her swing-state field operations. They reassure one another by reminding themselves of President Obama's two winning campaigns, which encountered similar fits of concern after Labor Day.\par \par \uc2 But even some zealous \uc2 Clinton\uc2  defenders have grown frustrated with their candidate, marveling at the prospect of her snatching defeat from the jaws of victory, for which some say they would never forgive her. The campaign's decision last week not to acknowledge Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's pneumonia until two days after a diagnosis, once video surfaced of her stumbling out of a Sept. 11 memorial service on Sunday, has especially rankled.\par \par \uc2 ''They kept it from us,'' said Sonia Ascher, 74, a former campaign volunteer, sitting with her husband and son at a coffee shop in Portsmouth, N.H. ''It was just another thing again, another mistake, which she really can't afford right now.''\par \par \uc2 The gloom seems to be spreading. Maurice Doucet, 55, a software engineer from Portland, Ore., wondered aloud on Wednesday how the race had gotten this close, lamenting Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's use of a private email server as secretary of state.\par \par \uc2 ''The rational side of my brain goes, 'There's no way people are actually going to switch sides,''' he said of voters' movement toward Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 . ''But the emotional side,'' he added, his voice trailing off moments later.\par \par \uc2 In Washington Square Park in Manhattan, among smitten college students and acoustic guitars, Guillermo Vidal, 75, grimaced at the thought of a \uc2 Trump\uc2  presidency. His friend's bichon fris\u233\'00\'E9-poodle mix, Dipsy, sat on the bench beside him, looking fretful.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Vidal was asked what was troubling Dipsy.\par \par \uc2 ''She's a Democrat,'' Mr. Vidal said dryly.\par \par \uc2 Then there are those who traffic in angst professionally, who are straining to consider even the chance of a \uc2 Trump election\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 ''The possibility of that is too horrifying to broach,'' Larry David, the ''Seinfeld'' co-creator and ''Curb Your Enthusiasm'' star, wrote in an email. ''It's like contemplating your own death.''\par \par \uc2 Surely Mr. David had done that, too?\par \par \uc2 ''I can't go there,'' he said.\par \par \uc2 In liberal enclaves, some modest contingency planning has begun. Threats of relocation are a bipartisan ritual every four years, expanding the audience for Canadian home listings. But this time, voters seem to be taking their research a bit more seriously.\par \par \uc2 Ramona Gant, 28, a graduate student in Chicago, said she had just renewed her passport with the \uc2 election\uc2  in mind.\par \par \uc2 Ms. Donohue's friend at Zabar's, Ms. Anderson, also of Seattle, mused that Vancouver was not too far up the road.\par \par \uc2 Mike Brennan, 67, from Ventura County, Calif., is keeping an eye on the stock market.\par \par \uc2 ''If it looks like it's going to be close,'' said Mr. Brennan, a Republican supporting Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , ''I'll pull my money out.''\par \par \uc2 For many Americans, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's momentum has registered as a more visceral threat, heightening concerns that had festered since his candidacy began. Ahtziry Barrera, 18, a college freshman from Orlando, Fla., arrived in the United States more than a decade ago from Mexico. Under an Obama administration policy known as DACA, which Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  has vowed to protect, Ms. Barrera has been allowed to stay in the country because she entered as a child.\par \par \uc2 ''A lot of people were not taking him seriously. 'Oh, he's not going to win.' But it happened,'' she said of Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's success in the Republican primary race. ''It is a big stress on me, knowing that Nov. 8 is the day I'll know whether my future is going to be secure or not.''\par \par \uc2 Some optimists have preached calm, reminding one another of Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's organizational advantages and holding out hope that she can best Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  decisively on a debate stage.\par \par \uc2 While allowing that Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  has not run a perfect race, many of her admirers have cast blame elsewhere, singling out the news media, the Republicans who nominated Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  and, of course, the man himself.\par \par \uc2 Gloria Steinem, the feminist leader and a \uc2 Clinton\uc2  supporter, said in an email that she had sensed a growing worry in recent weeks, fearing that Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's candidacy was becoming ''legitimized by 'media evenhandedness''' that had made his assorted scandals seem more banal.\par \par \uc2 ''There are things any campaign could do better, but in this case, I fear it's like blaming the victim instead of the bully -- dissociating in the hope that we won't be bullied, too,'' she wrote. ''It's like saying, 'If only she hadn't been walking in that neighborhood. ...'''\par \par \uc2 Others hold tight to an abiding belief, perhaps against their better judgment, that everything will work out.\par \par \uc2 ''I still believe in humanity,'' said Nadia Johnson, 22, a Brooklyn resident lunching at a \uc2 Whole Foods\uc2  this week.\par \par \uc2 She quickly added a request: Ask her again in November.\par \par \uc2 Find out what you need to know about the 2016 presidential race today, and get politics news updates via \uc2 Facebook\uc2 , \uc2 Twitter\uc2  and the First Draft newsletter.\par \par \uc2 A fund-raiser for Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's campaign was held on Thursday at Fishs Eddy, a home goods store in Manhattan.

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Wow. \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  says President Obama was born here. What a concession. No wonder he's trending up in the polls.\par \par \uc2 How did we get to this place, people? The big story of the day is that a candidate for president of the United States -- a candidate who, according to The Times's Upshot model, now has a one in four chance of being elected -- admits he spent years telling the American people a stupendous lie. And even now, he won't say he's sorry.\par \par \uc2 ''President \uc2 Barack Obama\uc2  was born in the United States, period. Now we all want to get back to making America strong and great again,'' \uc2 Trump\uc2  said abruptly and briefly on Friday. This was at his new Washington hotel, which he has been promoting with an avidity he has never devoted to, say, getting his immigration policy straight.\par \par \uc2 Then \uc2 Trump\uc2  claimed that \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  had been first to spread the rumor that Obama was not a native-born citizen. This is a lie. A lie that all the fact checkers in the world debunked when he started saying it long ago.\par \par \uc2 People, I know some of you get very frustrated that news coverage of this \uc2 election\uc2  does not begin every day with: ''In yet another total falsehood, \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  ...'' This is your moment.\par \par \uc2 The Day of the Double Falsehood is a very clear, very dramatic example of \uc2 Trump\uc2 's tendency to, um, speak fictionally. He was just a real estate guy with a cheesy TV show until 2011, when he sort of ran for president, in a bid that focused almost entirely on his claims that \uc2 Barack Obama\uc2  had come from Kenya.\par \par \uc2 ''Three weeks ago I thought he was born in this country. Right now I have some real doubts. I have people that actually have been studying it, and they cannot believe what they're finding,'' he told an \uc2 NBC\uc2  interviewer.\par \par \uc2 We never did learn what they found. But \uc2 Trump\uc2  has continued to get some of his most startling information from ''people.'' During the primary season in New Hampshire, a man at a \uc2 Trump\uc2  town hall gathering got up to claim Obama was a Muslim and ''not even an American.'' Strong candidates tell guys like this they're wrong. Weak candidates ignore them. \uc2 Trump\uc2  responded, ''You know, a lot of people are saying that. ...''\par \par \uc2 None of the outrageous things he says are his fault. You got a complaint, take it to the people.\par \par \uc2 Trump\uc2 's campaign wanted the birther issue to be made to go away. First, running mate \uc2 Mike Pence\uc2  said he believed Obama was a natural-born American citizen.\par \par \uc2 ''I confirm that and \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  now confirms that,'' First Pal Rudy Giuliani told another interviewer. \uc2 Trump\uc2  had changed his mind, Giuliani claimed, two or three years ago. That would have been around the time he was tweeting: ''How amazing, the State Health Director who verified copies of Obama's 'birth certificate' died in plane crash today. All others lived.''\par \par \uc2 Moving the candidate himself was obviously a harder job. When The \uc2 Washington Post\uc2  asked him this week if he'd changed his mind, \uc2 Trump\uc2  said, ''I just don't want to answer it yet.''\par \par \uc2 I've always said that women won't vote for a candidate who yells because he'll remind them of a bad boyfriend. This is the behavior of the nightmare date from hell. Who tells you exciting stories over drinks, all of which are clearly untrue, and then gets sullen and refuses to talk when you ask a couple of questions.\par \par \uc2 Trump\uc2 's people were forced to come up with an unwinding scenario that did not require the candidate to admit he'd ever done anything wrong. So they sent out a press release announcing that \uc2 Trump\uc2  was the hero of the story -- the man who stamped out the birther rumor, which was started by \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's ''vicious and conniving behavior.'' \uc2 Trump\uc2 's demands for the truth had forced Obama to release the long-form version of his Hawaii birth certificate while ''\uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  was too weak to get an answer.''\par \par \uc2 ''Inarguably, \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2  is a closer. Having successfully obtained President Obama's birth certificate when others could not, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  believes that President Obama was born in the United States,'' the campaign's statement concluded.\par \par \uc2 Even the most creative minds in the press office could not come up with any explanation for why it took \uc2 Trump\uc2  five years to acknowledge what the birth certificate proved. Asked about that, Pence said, disjointedly and desperately, that his running mate's record on behalf of the African-American community ''really speaks for itself.''\par \par \uc2 What we have here is a candidate for president of the United States who makes stuff up all the time, but is either incapable of realizing that he's telling a lie, or constitutionally unable to take blame for being untruthful.\par \par \uc2 Yet, according to the polls, \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's biggest problem is that the public thinks she's dishonest. Amazing.\par \par \uc2 I invite you to join me on \uc2 Facebook\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Follow The \uc2 New York Times\uc2  Opinion section on \uc2 Facebook\uc2  and \uc2 Twitter\uc2  (@NYTopinion), and sign up for the Opinion Today newsletter.\par \par \uc2 Document NYTF000020160917ec9h0003m\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 Metropolitan Desk; SECTA\par \b \uc2 A Staten Island Mosque Mixes Prayer and Patriotism\b0\par\par\uc2 By SAMANTHA SCHMIDT \par \uc2 1,006 \uc2 words\par \uc2 17 September 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 15\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 The man stood at the podium in the cramped Masjid Un-Noor mosque on Staten Island as hundreds of Muslims sat barefoot on the carpet before him, facing east, just before the start of Friday prayers. In his outstretched right hand, he held up a tiny American flag and a pocket-size copy of the Constitution.\par \par \uc2 ''This unites us,'' said the man, Suhail Muzaffar, a leader at the mosque. ''It is not Christian, it is not Buddhist, it is not Muslim.''\par \par \uc2 ''Please,'' he added. ''Find time to look at this document.''\par \par \uc2 The scene, charged with symbolism, had a familiarity for many in the crowd. After the services, one man in the congregation approached Mr. Muzaffar and told him, ''You looked just like Khizr Khan.''\par \par \uc2 He was referring, of course, to the Pakistani immigrant whose tribute to his son, an Army captain killed in combat, electrified the Democratic National Convention in what became a memorable moment in the presidential campaign, caused sales of pocket-size copies of the Constitution to skyrocket and galvanized American Muslims eager to answer the anti-Muslim rhetoric of \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , the Republican presidential nominee.\par \par \uc2 A month and a half after that speech, what might be called the Khizr Khan effect was as palpable as ever in this small Muslim community on Staten Island. After the prayers, a group of high school students passed out 200 miniature copies of the Constitution, accompanied by an equal number of American flags, to mosque members, in hopes that reading it would remind them of their rights as Americans.\par \par \uc2 Mohammad Manhal Hussain, 17, who is known as Manhal, was an intern at the mosque this summer. He was helping Mr. Muzaffar organize a voter registration drive when he watched Mr. Khan deliver his convention speech.\par \par \uc2 ''It's powerful to see a Muslim man standing and giving a speech at the D.N.C.,'' he said. ''That got us all on our toes.''\par \par \uc2 He said he had asked Mr. Muzaffar if the mosque could order a shipment of the small copies of the Constitution to distribute to the congregation on Friday, the day before the anniversary of the Constitution's signing in 1787. He thought it would help affirm for the congregation's members that their rights as American citizens were clear, despite what they might hear from Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  and other politicians.\par \par \uc2 ''It's a sense of comfort,'' Manhal said. ''If they're saying my rights don't fit, then theirs don't either.''\par \par \uc2 Mr. Muzaffar said that reading the Constitution was especially important for congregants of his who had recently immigrated from Pakistan and were more in tune with the politics of their home country than they were with politics in the United States.\par \par \uc2 He said he hoped it would also help the mosque's broader effort to increase voter registration among members, mirroring a nationwide push by Muslim leaders to encourage American Muslims to make their voices heard in this year's \uc2 election\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Robert McCaw, director of government affairs at the Council on American-Islamic Relations, a national advocacy group, said the Muslim vote could help tip the \uc2 election\uc2 , given the large numbers of Muslim voters in swing states like Florida, Ohio and Virginia.\par \par \uc2 On Staten Island, a Republican stronghold and New York City's least ethnically diverse borough, Mr. Muzaffar said he felt that Muslim residents had a crucial duty to vote.\par \par \uc2 ''You want to fight back?'' he said. ''There is no bigger bullet than the ballot.''\par \par \uc2 Estimates of the Muslim population in the city vary widely, from a few hundred thousand to more than one million. Of the five boroughs, Staten Island has the fewest Muslims, said Abdul Bhuiyan, secretary general of the Majlis Ashura, the Islamic Leadership Council of New York. Brooklyn, the borough with the largest Muslim population, has more than 70 mosques, he said; Staten Island has about a half-dozen.\par \par \uc2 There were no mosques on Staten Island before the mid-1980s, Mr. Muzaffar said. Masjid Un-Noor was its first. But, he added, ''the face of Staten Island is changing.'' He estimated that about 10,000 Muslims may live in the borough now.\par \par \uc2 Manhal, the summer intern, said the goal was to persuade 1,500 members of the roughly 600-family congregation to register to vote. More than 700 had signed up so far, he said.\par \par \uc2 With that kind of clout, he said, ''we have a form of power, a form of strength within our community.''\par \par \uc2 Nearly all 200 of the miniature copies of the Constitution had been distributed by the end of Friday. Aziz Ur-Rehman, 78, who immigrated to the United States from Pakistan nine years ago, grabbed one on his way out of the mosque. He had never read it before, he said, and planned to look it over as soon as he got home.\par \par \uc2 ''I'm going to have it in my pocket,'' he said.\par \par \uc2 As Amal Muzaffar, 23, Suhail Muzaffar's daughter, walked through the parking lot with an extra box of the copies, several people approached asking her where they could get one.\par \par \uc2 ''It's telling our community that you are American,'' she said. ''Feel that connection, and feel that you're not an outsider.''\par \par \uc2 In his brief speech to the congregation during the prayer services, Mr. Muzaffar urged his fellow Muslims not to think of the American political system as defective, even if they felt threatened by the rhetoric of politicians like Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 ''No sir,'' he said. ''Look at the effective part, that you as an American citizen get to decide whether he gets to be president or not.''\par \par \uc2 And he urged members of the congregation, once more, to read the Constitution. ''It's very, very simple,'' he insisted.\par \par \uc2 ''And vote this year,'' he added, ''inshallah'' -- God willing.\par \par \uc2 Distributing American flags and pocket-size copies of the Constitution on Friday at Masjid Un-Noor mosque on Staten Island.

\par\par \uc2 NEWS ANALYSIS\par \uc2 National Desk; SECTA\par \b \uc2 Trump\uc2  Gives Up a Lie but Refuses to Repent\b0\par\par\uc2 By MICHAEL BARBARO \par \uc2 830 \uc2 words\par \uc2 17 September 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 1\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 It was not true in 2011, when \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2  mischievously began to question President Obama's birthplace aloud in television interviews. ''I'm starting to think that he was not born here,'' he said at the time.\par \par \uc2 It was not true in 2012, when he took to \uc2 Twitter\uc2  to declare that ''an 'extremely credible source''' had called his office to inform him that Mr. Obama's birth certificate was ''a fraud.''\par \par \uc2 It was not true in 2014, when Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  invited hackers to ''please hack Obama's college records (destroyed?) and check 'place of birth.'''\par \par \uc2 It was never true, any of it. Mr. Obama's citizenship was never in question. No credible evidence ever suggested otherwise.\par \par \uc2 Yet it took Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  five years of dodging, winking and joking to surrender to reality, finally, on Friday, after a remarkable campaign of relentless deception that tried to undermine the legitimacy of the nation's first black president.\par \par \uc2 In fact, it took Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  much longer than that: Mr. Obama released his short-form birth certificate from the \uc2 Hawaii Department of Health\uc2  in 2008. Most of the world moved on.\par \par \uc2 But not Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 He nurtured the conspiracy like a poisonous flower, watering and feeding it with an ardor that still baffles and embarrasses many around him.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  called up like-minded sowers of the same corrosive rumor, asking them for advice on how to take a falsehood and make it mainstream in 2011, as he weighed his own run for the White House.\par \par \uc2 ''What can we do to get to the bottom of this?'' Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  asked Joseph Farah, an author who has long labored on the fringes of political life. ''What can we do to turn the tide?''\par \par \uc2 What he could do -- and what he did do -- was talk about it, uninhibitedly, on social media, where dark rumors flourish in 140-character bursts and, inevitably, find a home with those who have no need for facts and whose suspicions can never be allayed.\par \par \uc2 And he mused about it on television, where bright lights and sparse editing ensure that millions can hear falsehoods unchallenged by fact-checking.\par \par \uc2 ''Why doesn't he show his birth certificate?'' Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  asked on ABC's ''The View.'' ''I want to see his birth certificate,'' he told Fox News's ''On the Record.''\par \par \uc2 And so it went.\par \par \uc2 The essential question -- Why promote a lie? -- may be unanswerable. Was it sport? Was it his lifelong quest to court media attention? Was it racism? Was it the cynical start of his eventual campaign for president?\par \par \uc2 It might not matter. He kept doing it, even as his most senior aides assured the public that he had long since abandoned the fallacy.\par \par \uc2 He had not. He was disingenuous until the very end, telling a Washington Post reporter just 72 hours before that he was unready to concede the president's place of birth. But he treated the weighty topic, as he does so much else, like a television cliffhanger, promising a major declaration on Friday.\par \par \uc2 And then, around 11 a.m. Friday in Washington, he gave up the lie. But he conjured up a bizarre new deception, congratulating himself for putting to rest the doubts about Mr. Obama that he had fanned since 2011. ''I finished it,'' he declared, unapologetically. ''President Obama was born in the United States -- period.''\par \par \uc2 Surrounded by, and in many ways shielded by, decorated veterans in his new Washington hotel, he could not resist indulging in another falsehood -- that his opponent, \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , had started the so-called birther movement. She did not.\par \par \uc2 Much has been made of Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's casual elasticity with the truth; he has exhausted an army of fact-checkers with his mischaracterizations, exaggerations and fabrications. But this lie was different from the start, an insidious, calculated calumny that sought to undo the embrace of an African-American president by the 69 million voters who elected him in 2008.\par \par \uc2 In the end, it seemed, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's plot to diminish Mr. Obama did not succeed. On Friday, the president of the United States seemed much bigger.\par \par \uc2 ''I was pretty confident about where I was born,'' Mr. Obama said from the White House, a wry smile crossing his face. ''I think most people were as well.''\par \par \uc2 And the president had this to say about the myth heedlessly spread by the man seeking to replace him: ''My hope would be that the presidential \uc2 election\uc2  reflects more serious issues than that.''\par \par \uc2 Find out what you need to know about the 2016 presidential race today, and get politics news updates via \uc2 Facebook\uc2 , \uc2 Twitter\uc2  and the First Draft newsletter.\par \par \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , campaigning Friday in Washington, finally acknowledged that President Obama was born in the United States.

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 To the Editor:\par \par \uc2 Re ''In a Narrow Race, Many View \uc2 Trump\uc2  as a Change Agent'' (front page, Sept. 16):\par \par \uc2 I have been asking myself why the momentum has shifted to \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  and the polls have tightened. One big reason, I believe, is how the candidates have framed their policy proposals. There is little doubt that creating jobs and combating terrorism are the two central themes in this \uc2 election\uc2 . Where do the candidates stand?\par \par \uc2 Well, on jobs, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  will slash taxes, slash regulations and rewrite all trade deals. \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  -- I'm not so sure. On terrorism, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  will build a wall, limit immigration and engage in ''extreme vetting.'' Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  -- I'm not so sure. Therein lies the problem.\par \par \uc2 I do not believe in Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's proposals, I don't think they will work, but, at least in theory, I know what they are. With Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , I do not feel that I really know, and I am a supporter. Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , you must give the voters a positive reason to vote for you. We know the reasons you cite to vote against Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 . People want more, people need more.\par \par \uc2 KEN DEROW\par \par \uc2 Swarthmore, Pa.\par \par \uc2 To the Editor:\par \par \uc2 Re ''When a Crackpot Seeks Office,'' by Nicholas Kristof (column, Sept. 15):\par \par \uc2 One of the problems with the idea of the media calling out \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  on his numerous lies is that the first thing someone like Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  does is to convince his followers that the media are liars and he is the only source of truth. The more they attack him -- that is, accurately and vigorously report on him -- the deeper the true believers dig in.\par \par \uc2 JOHN GREER\par \par \uc2 Lacey, Wash.\par \par \uc2 Document NYTF000020160917ec9h00036\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 CONTRIBUTING OP-ED WRITER\par \uc2 Editorial Desk; SECTA\par \b \uc2 America the Plunderer\b0\par\par\uc2 By TIMOTHY EGAN \par \uc2 906 \uc2 words\par \uc2 17 September 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 17\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Because he's being graded on a doofus curve that is unprecedented in presidential politics, \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  said more than a dozen outrageous, scary or untrue things in the last 10 days and got away with all of them. But with at least one statement, marking a profound shift in how the United States would interact with the rest of the world, \uc2 Trump\uc2  should be shamed back to his golden throne.\par \par \uc2 He wants the United States to become a nation that steals from its enemies. He's already called for war crimes -- killing family members of terrorists, torturing suspects. He would further violate the Geneva Conventions by making thieves out of a first-class military.\par \par \uc2 ''It used to be to the victor belong the spoils,'' \uc2 Trump\uc2  complained to the compliant Matt Lauer in the now infamous commander-in-chief forum. Oh, for the days when Goths, Vandals and Nazis were free to rape, pillage and plunder. So unfair, as \uc2 Trump\uc2  said on an earlier occasion, that we have ''all sorts of rules and regulations, so the soldiers are afraid to fight.''\par \par \uc2 As with everything in \uc2 Trump\uc2 's world, his solution is simple: loot and pilfer. ''Take the oil,'' said \uc2 Trump\uc2 . He was referring to Iraq, post-invasion. And how would he do this? There would be an open-ended occupation, as a sovereign nation's oil was stolen from it. Of course, ''you'd leave a certain group behind,'' he said, to protect the petro thieves.\par \par \uc2 A certain group. Let's be clear what he's talking about: Under \uc2 Trump\uc2 's plan, American men and women would die for oil, victims of endless rounds of lethal sabotage and terror strikes. That's your certain group. He thinks we could get in, get the oil, and get out. Just like the cakewalk of occupying Iraq. And if such a seizure violates international law, what's the rest of the world going to do about it? ''Anything is legal'' in war, as the deranged \uc2 Trump\uc2  surrogate \uc2 Rudy Giuliani\uc2  explained.\par \par \uc2 For this kind of plunder, there is in fact a precedent for \uc2 Trump\uc2 's plan: Saddam Hussein's invasion of Kuwait. The United States fought the first gulf war because the Iraqi dictator tried to seize Kuwait's oil. We were the good guys, fighting an invading military force that was trying to steal a small country's most precious natural resource.\par \par \uc2 I realize with \uc2 Trump\uc2  that any discussion of actual ''issues'' is not for our political press. Can't we just talk about that awesome Dr. Oz exam? But even one of \uc2 Trump\uc2 's top military supporters, Maj. Gen. Sidney Shachnow, retired, thought the candidate's conquer-and-steal plan was insane. ''It's a bad precedent,'' he told NBC News. ''That oil belongs to somebody else.'' Sorry, soldier: You're going to have to follow \uc2 Trump\uc2 's orders.\par \par \uc2 Of course, the Mideast would be aflame with violent anti-Americanism if \uc2 Trump\uc2 's troops sat on the oil wells in the desert. Iran, seeing a fellow Shiite-majority nation robbed of its lifeblood, would strike, and jump again into a fast-paced development of a nuclear bomb.\par \par \uc2 But, by then, \uc2 Trump\uc2  would already be at war with Iran, as he suggested in another of his overlooked recent statements. He said if the Iranians made inappropriate ''gestures'' at ''our beautiful boats'' he would shoot them. He would start a war, in other words, if they flipped off our sailors.\par \par \uc2 Let's imagine the \uc2 Trump\uc2  Doctrine after World War II. Instead of building model democracies, vigorous trade partners and allies in global sanity out of Germany and Japan, American troops would have looted those countries of all their worth and left them ripe for a fresh dictator. It was one of the highlights of my grandfather's life, as a member of the Judge Advocate General's Corps, to help rebuild Germany after it was left in ruins.\par \par \uc2 Today, my grandfather would be forced by \uc2 Trump\uc2  to violate the codes of international behavior that the United States has long tried to uphold. \uc2 Trump\uc2  would put us on the side of tyrants and monarchs, the people our founders tried to disentangle us from.\par \par \uc2 Trump\uc2  would become a war criminal, a role he seems to relish -- typical for a man who has never served a day in the military. Take it from someone who has served, and defeated another nation, \uc2 Colin Powell\uc2 . \uc2 Trump\uc2 , he said in emails leaked this week, is ''a national disgrace and an international pariah.''\par \par \uc2 But \uc2 Trump\uc2  would have an ally in kleptocracy with his favorite world leader, the former K.G.B. operative \uc2 Vladimir Putin\uc2 . \uc2 Trump\uc2  is Russia's useful idiot, dismissing its international aggressions and human rights violations. Putin can do no wrong because, ''if he says great things about me,'' as \uc2 Trump\uc2  said, ''I'm going to say great things about him.'' \uc2 Trump\uc2  then went on a Russian propaganda television network to prove his point.\par \par \uc2 Some may call this flirting with treason, the enabling of an American adversary -- something that \uc2 Trump\uc2  has done earlier with his suggestion that Russia try to destabilize the American \uc2 election\uc2 . To that, he's openly advocating war crimes. Can he get away with it? He already has.\par \par \uc2 Follow me on Twitter (@nytegan).\par \par \uc2 Follow The \uc2 New York Times\uc2  Opinion section on \uc2 Facebook\uc2  and Twitter, and sign up for the Opinion Today newsletter.\par \par \uc2 Document NYTF000020160917ec9h0002v\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw272\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4080\pichgoal600

\par\par \b \uc2 Young Voters Cool to \uc2 Clinton\uc2  --- Candidate loses lead among millennials, prompting campaign to bring out party stars\b0\par\par\uc2 By Aaron Zitner and Rebecca Ballhaus   \par \uc2 1,002 \uc2 words\par \uc2 17 September 2016\par \uc2 The Wall Street Journal\par \uc2 J\par A1\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 FAIRFAX, Va. -- \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's once-commanding lead among young voters has nearly collapsed, several polls show, a factor making the presidential race much closer in recent weeks and prompting the \uc2 Clinton\uc2  campaign to move quickly to keep a core Democratic constituency in the fold.\par \par \uc2 In its most visible response, the campaign has begun sending the party's most popular stars to college campuses to urge students not to sit out the \uc2 election\uc2  or back third-party candidates, who are drawing support from young voters.\par \par \uc2 "Elections aren't just about who votes, but who doesn't vote, and that is especially true for young people like all of you," first lady \uc2 Michelle Obama\uc2  said Friday during a campaign event at a university in Virginia, a battleground state where polls show the race tightening.\par \par \uc2 Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, a sensation among younger voters during the Democratic primaries, will campaign for Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  this weekend, and Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, a liberal icon, will attend events this weekend at two Ohio universities.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Sanders previewed his message on Friday, saying he will urge young voters to look past the candidates' personalities and instead consider Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's proposals for debt-free college and for raising taxes on the wealthy to fund government programs.\par \par \uc2 "I would just simply say to the millennials, to anybody else: Look at the issues. . . . Stay focused on the issues of relevance to your life," Mr. Sanders said on MSNBC.\par \par \uc2 The outreach comes as polls show younger voters moving away from Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 . Among those under age 35, Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's lead over Republican presidential rival \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  fell from 24 points in late August to just 5 points this month in \uc2 Quinnipiac\uc2  surveys. That was one reason her overall lead among likely voters fell from 7 points to 2 points.\par \par \uc2 Similarly, Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  bested Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  by 27 points among voters under 35 in a Fox News survey in early August. That lead fell to 9 points in a new Fox News survey.\par \par \uc2 The trend is appearing in some state surveys, as well: In a new poll of Michigan voters, Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's 24-point lead among young voters a month ago fell to 7 points. That change helped account for why her 11-point lead among voters overall fell to 3 points in the survey, conducted for the Detroit Free Press and WXYZ.\par \par \uc2 Gary Johnson\uc2 , the libertarian candidate, is picking up many of the young voters who had backed Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 . In the \uc2 Quinnipiac\uc2  poll, he drew a significant 29% of likely voters under age 35, up from 16% in August. He trailed Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  by only 2 percentage points among those voters, a sign of how potentially damaging he could be to her campaign.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Johnson's support overall remains low, and the \uc2 Commission on Presidential Debates\uc2  said Friday that both he and Green Party candidate Jill Stein failed to qualify for the first debate, citing its requirement that candidates have at least 15% support in five predetermined national polls.\par \par \uc2 Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  struggled to win young voters in the Democratic primaries against Mr. Sanders, who won nearly three-quarters of those under age 30, exit polls showed. President \uc2 Barack Obama\uc2  won 60% of voters under 30 in the 2012 \uc2 election\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 These voters may now join the list of trouble spots in the electorate for Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , along with white, working-class voters, particularly men. The Michigan poll also signaled a new, potential problem for Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  among African-Americans, as she was holding only 74% of them, compared with President \uc2 Barack Obama\uc2 's 93% in 2012 and down from 85% for Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  in August.\par \par \uc2 Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's challenge was apparent Friday on the campus of \uc2 George Mason University\uc2 , where Mrs. Obama spoke at a campaign event. Some students appeared more enthusiastic about the first lady than about Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  "doesn't rally up the younger folks like \uc2 Barack Obama\uc2  did, because he was younger and a fresh face," said Adam Clayton Hunter, a 2013 graduate of the university who now works as a teacher. He added that he viewed her as the most qualified candidate and would vote for her.\par \par \uc2 Some students said Mrs. Obama's endorsement made them favor Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  more as a candidate. Brianna Nunez and Victoria Johnson, both juniors at the university, supported Mr. Sanders during the Democratic primary and have since rallied -- a bit reluctantly -- behind Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Within the \uc2 Clinton\uc2  campaign, officials acknowledged the challenge of retaining younger voters. "We haven't closed the deal," said Joel Benenson, a pollster and senior adviser, on Friday.\par \par \uc2 Outlining the campaign's message to young voters, Mr. Benenson said: "Are we going to be the kind of tolerant country that they believe in and that \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  believes in, that's central to this campaign?"\par \par \uc2 The main super PAC backing Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , Priorities USA Action, will join the outreach effort by "intensifying" an ad campaign aimed at mobilizing young voters, a spokesman said.\par \par \uc2 After polling by the group found many young voters plan to vote for a third-party candidate or are considering doing so, the super PAC tested various messages to see the best way to persuade them to back Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , the official said.\par \par \uc2 One of the best arguments was that casting a vote for a third-party candidate "is a vote for \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2 ," the official said.\par \par \uc2 Among young voters, Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  seems to be facing the most problems with those under 28, particularly men, said Kei Kawashima-Ginsberg, director of Circle, an institute at \uc2 Tufts University\uc2  that studies civic engagement among youth. These younger voters don't tend to associate with any political party and are willing to consider Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  or Mr. Johnson, she said.\par \par \uc2 ---\par \par \uc2 Peter Nicholas, Laura Meckler and Dante Chinni contributed to this article.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=wjco20160917000097"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document J000000020160917ec9h0002e\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw272\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4080\pichgoal600

\par\par \b \uc2 Election\uc2  2016: Debates Are on TV, but Advertisers Target Eyeballs Online\b0\par\par\uc2 By Natalie Andrews   \par \uc2 336 \uc2 words\par \uc2 17 September 2016\par \uc2 The Wall Street Journal\par \uc2 J\par A4\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 Ten days or so ahead of the first presidential debate, political advertisers are planning to grab millions of viewers' eyes -- but with a difference. The candidate showdowns have no television commercials, so the focus will be online.\par \par \uc2 To rise above the millions of tweets and posts expected about the debate, campaigns, super PACs and advocacy groups will pay for premium spots in online news feeds or search results, with the expectation that debate viewers will be checking their phones or laptops while watching TV.\par \par \uc2 The first 90-minute debate between Republican \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  and Democrat \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  is on Sept. 26, and Jenna Golden, head of political advertising sales at \uc2 Twitter\uc2 , says her team of 10 people -- five who work with Republican groups and five who work with Democratic ones -- is consulting with clients to plan strategy.\par \par \uc2 More than 67 million viewers watched the first debate in 2012 between President \uc2 Barack Obama\uc2  and Republican nominee \uc2 Mitt Romney\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Zac Moffatt who served as the Romney campaign's digital director said the group prepared for weeks before the debate to be able to respond quickly, creating a 280-page book that "had a response for everything," including approved text for social media, graphics and links.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Moffatt is the co-founder of Targeted Victory, a firm that works with GOP lawmakers, campaigns, and advocacy groups.\par \par \uc2 Digital ads are priced in an auction-style format. Advertisers target the demographic they want to reach on the basis of categories such as age, gender and location. One category, for instance, could be male Republicans in southern Ohio.\par \par \uc2 A social-media ad can cost as little as a few dollars. But to break through the noise expected on debate night -- 10 million tweets were sent during the first debate in 2012 -- Ms. Golden said that her team is "definitely encouraging advertisers to spend upwards of six figures" on \uc2 Twitter\uc2  ads.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=wjco20160917000095"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document J000000020160917ec9h0002c\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw272\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4080\pichgoal600

\par\par \b \uc2 Election\uc2  2016: Tax Plan Raises Questions --- \uc2 Trump\uc2  team is unclear on whether a 15% business rate would apply to all companies\b0\par\par\uc2 By Richard Rubin   \par \uc2 777 \uc2 words\par \uc2 17 September 2016\par \uc2 The Wall Street Journal\par \uc2 J\par A4\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 In unveiling his updated economic plan Thursday, \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  challenged the assembled to "look at the math."\par \par \uc2 "It works," the Republican presidential nominee said.\par \par \uc2 But a crucial plank of his tax proposal -- whether his 15% business tax rate would apply to all businesses or just some -- is a mathematical muddle, clouded by shifting statements from the candidate and his campaign. He has either abandoned a core provision of the tax plan he unveiled last year, or underestimated, by more than $1 trillion, according to one estimate, how deep a tax cut he is proposing.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , his campaign and outside experts who have talked to the campaign have offered many explanations before and since his speech on Thursday in New York, and they haven't clearly said yet what the campaign's plan is.\par \par \uc2 The numbers in the speech show his tax cuts would subtract $4.4 trillion in revenue over a decade, based on the assumption that only corporations, not all businesses, would pay a 15% tax rate, according to the conservative-leaning \uc2 Tax Foundation\uc2 . If all businesses would be able to pay that 15%, the tax cut would cost an additional $1 trillion over a decade, the \uc2 Tax Foundation\uc2  said.\par \par \uc2 It isn't just an academic question for accountants and tax lawyers. Millions of U.S. businesses -- from corner stores to successful global law firms to Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's companies -- pass their profits to their owners' individual tax returns and pay taxes at the owners' individual rates. The top 1% of households receive 51% of business income on individual returns, according to the \uc2 Tax Policy Center\uc2 , a Washington research group led by a former \uc2 Clinton\uc2  administration official.\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 Tax Foundation\uc2  said it would release an analysis of the proposal once it gets more information from the campaign.\par \par \uc2 Steven Mnuchin\uc2 , the campaign's national finance chairman, said Friday that the 15% rate is available to all businesses that reinvest their earnings. Business owners who later take the money out of their companies would pay another layer of tax. That would make many pass-through businesses more like corporations, the kind of tax system that small-business groups have resisted.\par \par \uc2 "It doesn't matter what the form of the business is," Mr. Mnuchin said. "The intent of the policy is whether you're a big business or a small business, you're going to have the benefit of this."\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's first tax plan, released in September 2015, included a 15% tax rate for all businesses, and he talked up that proposal during campaign speeches. But in an August speech in Detroit, as part of a bid to stem revenue losses, he said the top tax rate on individuals would be 33%, not the 25% he earlier proposed.\par \par \uc2 That gap between the 33% rate on individuals and the 15% rate on business income would create huge opportunities for tax avoidance, giving people incentives to report their wages as business profits.\par \par \uc2 It would also create inequities. For example, law-firm partners could pay lower tax rates than their associates. And \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's campaign started characterizing the proposal as the "\uc2 Trump\uc2  Loophole."\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  has used his plan to lower taxes on all businesses to secure support and endorsements, said Michael Shapiro, an economic policy adviser to Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , in a statement. "His plan does exactly what he has designed it to do: provide billions in tax breaks to wealthy taxpayers like himself," he said.\par \par \uc2 Before Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's New York speechon Thursday, his campaign said the "corporate tax rate" would be cut to 15%. It suggested that pass-through businesses would be taxed as high as 33%, and that is consistent with the $4.4 trillion estimate he cited.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's speech itself was vague on this point.\par \par \uc2 Later in the day, however, the \uc2 National Federation of Independent Business\uc2  praised Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  for proposing to create "a single business tax rate that would create parity between small businesses and their larger competitors."\par \par \uc2 A spokesman for the NFIB, a powerful force in Republican politics, didn't respond to requests for comment on Friday.\par \par \uc2 The campaign also updated its website after Thursday's speech to say the 15% rate "is available to all businesses, both big and small, that want to retain the profits within the business."\par \par \uc2 "We are not really sure what the plan is at this point," said Brian Reardon, president of the S Corporation Association, another group that represents pass-through businesses.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=wjco20160917000094"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document J000000020160917ec9h0002b\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw272\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4080\pichgoal600

\par\par \b \uc2 Election\uc2  2016: \uc2 Trump\uc2  Backs Off A 'Birther' Claim\b0\par\par\uc2 By Reid J. Epstein and Michael C. Bender   \par \uc2 576 \uc2 words\par \uc2 17 September 2016\par \uc2 The Wall Street Journal\par \uc2 J\par A4\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 Republican presidential nominee \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  on Friday conceded that President \uc2 Barack Obama\uc2  was born in the U.S., standing down from years of false accusations that made the businessman a central figure in the discredited "birther" movement.\par \par \uc2 "President \uc2 Barack Obama\uc2  was born in the United States, period," Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  said at an event with the news media.\par \par \uc2 He then falsely assigned blame to Democratic rival \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  for igniting the suggestion, back in the 2008 Democratic primary campaign, that Mr. Obama, a Hawaii native, was born overseas. There is no evidence to support that claim; Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  didn't take questions from reporters before leaving a hotel ballroom.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's statement forces into the 2016 presidential campaign a conspiracy theory he fanned for years, though he has largely avoided discussing the issue of late. In early 2011, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  galvanized some support among Republicans by repeatedly advocating the claim that Mr. Obama was born in Kenya, as his father was. That campaign to cast doubt on Mr. Obama's citizenship, and thus his legitimacy to be president, got enough traction that the White House that spring released Mr. Obama's long-form birth certificate.\par \par \uc2 Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  and her surrogates have cast Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's questions about Mr. Obama's birth as racist. Speaking at a forum for black women Friday in Washington, Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  sought to emphasize the stakes in the \uc2 election\uc2  by saying Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's flirtation with a conspiracy theory underscores that he is unfit for office.\par \par \uc2 "For five years, he has led the birther movement to delegitimize our first black president," Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 . "His campaign was founded on this outrageous lie. There is no erasing it in history."\par \par \uc2 She continued: "\uc2 Barack Obama\uc2  was born in America plain and simple. And \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  owes him and the American people an apology," she said.\par \par \uc2 Injecting the issue of the president's birthplace into the campaign comes after Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  has made efforts to win support from African-American voters. The businessman on Wednesday visited a black church in Flint, Mich., and he has made appeals to black citizens by asking, "What do you have to lose?"\par \par \uc2 Members of the \uc2 Congressional Black Caucus\uc2  on Friday criticized him for not apologizing for questioning the president's birthplace.\par \par \uc2 Rep. Barbara Lee (D., Calif.) said the birthplace question from Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  "catapulted" his Republican presidential bid by aiming to "de-legitimize" the nation's first black president. "This is a defining moment for all of those who want to denounce bigotry and racism," she said.\par \par \uc2 Orly Taitz, a California dentist and attorney who was among the leading advocates of the birther cause, said in an interview Friday that "I still have questions" about the president's citizenship but said she doesn't hold Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's change of position on the subject against him.\par \par \uc2 "He is correct on concentrating on \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  instead," said Dr. Taitz, who is a \uc2 Trump\uc2  supporter.\par \par \uc2 For his part Mr. Obama said the focus on where he was born is a sideshow at a time when the country faces serious challenges.\par \par \uc2 "I was pretty confident about where I was born. I think most people were as well," Mr. Obama said after meeting with business leaders in the Oval Office.\par \par \uc2 ---\par \par \uc2 Byron Tau and Carol E.

\par\par \b \uc2 Election\uc2  2016: Back on Trail, \uc2 Clinton\uc2  Faces Tighter Race --- Shrunken lead in polls, newly disciplined \uc2 Trump\uc2  greet the Democrat after illness\b0\par\par\uc2 By Laura Meckler   \par \uc2 789 \uc2 words\par \uc2 16 September 2016\par \uc2 The Wall Street Journal\par \uc2 J\par A4\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 GREENSBORO, N.C. -- \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  returned to campaigning Thursday after illness and a pair of high-profile missteps took her presidential quest off message and off the road for the better part of a week.\par \par \uc2 The Democratic nominee was greeted with tightening polls, as a newly disciplined \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  gained ground nationally and in key states, and with what her campaign sees as an imperative to lay out a positive vision for herself and not just the case against her opponent.\par \par \uc2 Speaking at the University of North Carolina at Greensboro, Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  said that three days off the road as she recovered from pneumonia had given her an unexpected chance to reflect on why she was running for president.\par \par \uc2 "The campaign trail doesn't really encourage reflection and it's important to sit with your thoughts every now and then. It helped me reconnect what this whole campaign is about," she said.\par \par \uc2 She said the fight of her life has been to help children and families, and her mission as president would be to ensure they all have quality health care, financial security, clean water and other necessities.\par \par \uc2 Over the summer, Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  was ahead of the Republican nominee in national and key state polls; now, many show close contests, with the average of national polls giving Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  a slight edge. A New York Times/CBS News poll released Thursday showed a virtual tie nationally.\par \par \uc2 Talking to reporters, Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  professed no concern about the polls. "Those are the kinds of presidential elections that we have in America," she said.\par \par \uc2 She suggested that her campaign's ground game would give her the edge. "What matters is who is registered to vote and who is mobilized and motivated to turn out to vote," she said.\par \par \uc2 Democratic strategist Jim Manley described Democrats he knows as around a seven on a one-to-10 nervousness scale, and added that watching Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  methodically roll out policies, including economic proposals Thursday, has been "unsettling."\par \par \uc2 "I didn't think he had the ability or discipline to pull it off," he said.\par \par \uc2 "I felt a whole lot better about this campaign a few weeks ago than I do now. \uc2 Trump\uc2  definitely has some momentum, and the \uc2 Clinton\uc2  folks are going to have to deal with it," Mr. Manley said.\par \par \uc2 Although Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's Thursday speech focused on children and families, it included a sharp critique of Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 . She called his proposal this week to subsidize child care "half-baked" and not believable after "decades of ignoring and putting down moms." Senior aides said it remained important for her to "define the choice" for voters even as she lays out the case for her candidacy.\par \par \uc2 Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  had begun the work of promoting her vision last week. She delivered a speech about faith in Kansas City and showed a more personal side of herself in candid reflections on the popular blog Humans of New York.\par \par \uc2 But her message of inclusiveness was undermined a week ago when, at a fundraiser, she characterized about half of \uc2 Trump\uc2  supporters as "deplorables." She said she regretted pegging the number at half, but not for calling out some of his backers for racism, sexism and other prejudices.\par \par \uc2 Then the focus turned to her health and forthrightness when she belatedly disclosed Sunday that she had been battling pneumonia, hours after her campaign blamed dehydration when she fell ill at a 9/11 memorial event in New York City.\par \par \uc2 In an exchange with reporters Thursday, she said she agreed with her staff that they could have been faster at informing the public about her health. She also faced questions about why her running mate, Sen. Tim Kaine, also appeared not to know about her illness until two days after she was diagnosed.\par \par \uc2 "This was an ailment that many people just power through, and that's what I thought I would do as well," she said. She declined to comment on her talks with Mr. Kaine.\par \par \uc2 Many Democrats said they were waiting anxiously for this month's first presidential debate, saying her performance in that event could determine whether Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  is seen as a credible president by voters.\par \par \uc2 "We have a tightening race [and] you want to focus on going into the debate with positive momentum," said Chris Kofinis, a Democratic strategist. "The last six days won't matter if she does that and has a strong debate performance."\par \par \uc2 (See related letter: "Letters to the Editor: \uc2 Election\uc2 : The Number Twos Could Beat the Number Ones" -- WSJ Sept. 26, 2016)\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=wjco20160916000110"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document J000000020160916ec9g0002y\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 National Desk; SECTA\par \b \uc2 In a Narrow Race, Many View \uc2 Trump\uc2  as a Change Agent\b0\par\par\uc2 By PATRICK HEALY and DALIA SUSSMAN; Megan Thee-Brenan, Giovanni Russonello and Marina Stefan contributed reporting. \par \uc2 1,346 \uc2 words\par \uc2 16 September 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 1\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Most voters consider \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2  a risky choice for president, saying he lacks the right temperament and values, but he is seen as more transformative and better at handling the economy than \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , according to the latest New York Times/CBS News poll.\par \par \uc2 Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , despite being as disliked as Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , is seen as a safer option. Majorities of voters say she has the temperament for the job and would better handle foreign policy. Only 36 percent of them, however, view her as an agent of change. That perception deeply worries some \uc2 Clinton\uc2  campaign advisers, who want the race to hinge on Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's character rather than voters' desire to upend the status quo.\par \par \uc2 With less than eight weeks until \uc2 Election\uc2  Day, the two candidates are locked in a close contest in which the challenge from third-party candidates may make a difference. Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , the Democratic nominee, has the support of 46 percent of likely voters nationwide, compared with 44 percent for Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , the Republican; that result includes voters who said they were leaning toward a candidate.\par \par \uc2 Looking more broadly at all registered voters, Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  holds a wider edge, 46 to 41 percent, driven by her support among women, minorities and college graduates. Getting registered but unlikely voters to the polls in November is a large challenge for Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's campaign.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  has an advantage among men, whites and less educated voters.\par \par \uc2 In a four-way race, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  and Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  are tied at 42 percent each. \uc2 Gary Johnson\uc2 , the Libertarian candidate, has the support of 8 percent of likely voters, and the Green Party nominee, Jill Stein, takes 4 percent. Mr. Johnson is hoping to qualify for the coming presidential debates, but he is short of the requirement of reaching 15 percent support in an average of major polls.\par \par \uc2 Among likely voters younger than 30, Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's support drops 10 points in a four-way race. Their support for Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  falls seven points, but he is not relying on young voters as much.\par \par \uc2 The race has clearly grown tighter in recent weeks. National polling averages have narrowed markedly from early August to today.\par \par \uc2 Polls in a number of key swing states, including Ohio and Florida, have narrowed in the past week as well. Projections of Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's Electoral College advantage have also shown a tightening based on recent polls.\par \par \uc2 Voters expressed discontent with both candidates. Among those who say they intend to vote for Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  or Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , slightly more than half express strong support. The rest say that they harbor reservations about their candidate or that they are voting simply to thwart the other nominee.\par \par \uc2 Despite the voters' misgivings, the major-party nominees are consolidating support among their party faithful. Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  commands support of 87 percent of Democrats, while Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  is supported by 85 percent of Republicans.\par \par \uc2 The poll results offer more cause for concern than confidence for Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  and Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  as they prepare for their first debate, on Sept. 26, and as early voting begins in some states next weekend. Their favorability ratings remain stubbornly low, with only about one-third of voters seeing each of them positively, despite the candidates' attempts to use their conventions, commercials and public appearances to persuade voters to see them in a new light.\par \par \uc2 A majority of voters say Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  does not care about the needs or problems of Hispanics; most voters see Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  as caring about Hispanics, and a majority of voters agree with her view that most illegal immigrants in the country should be allowed to stay and eventually apply for citizenship.\par \par \uc2 The nationwide telephone poll was conducted with 1,433 registered voters from Sept. 9 to 13 on cellphones and landlines. The margin of sampling error is plus or minus three percentage points for all voters.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's temperament stands out as potentially his most damaging vulnerability, as his penchant for insults and provocations often undercuts his political message. \uc2 Trump\uc2  advisers see the televised debates as Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's greatest opportunity to reassure people about his personality, but he starts off in a weak position, with 64 percent of voters saying he does not have the right temperament to be president.\par \par \uc2 Sixty-seven percent of voters see Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  as a risky choice for president, compared with 51 percent who hold that view about Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  -- a surprising number in itself given that she has been a president's spouse, a senator and a secretary of state.\par \par \uc2 For \uc2 Trump\uc2  advisers, the image of Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  as a gamble comes with an upside. They concede that he is most likely to lose the \uc2 election\uc2  if a majority of voters view him as dangerous or reckless. But if he can persuade people to see him simply as unpredictable -- even cagey in a strategic sense -- as well as committed to disrupting the federal government, voters could regard him as worth taking a chance on for four years while looking to his advisers and Congress as a check on his power.\par \par \uc2 Several \uc2 Trump\uc2  supporters said in follow-up interviews that they believed he was worth the risk, given the economic and security challenges facing the nation. Forty-eight percent of voters think Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  could bring real change to Washington, a 12-point edge over Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 ; another 48 percent think he could not bring change.\par \par \uc2 ''The risky part with \uc2 Trump\uc2  is the fact of his rhetoric, how he says things,'' said Patrick Kellegher, 52, a political independent and a retired deputy sheriff from Anaconda, Mont. ''But I think he is outside the known government circles.'' He added, ''I think \uc2 Trump\uc2  will bring about real change because he's looking at it through a different scope.''\par \par \uc2 The candidates also face continued doubts about their honesty. Of the two, Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  has tried more visibly to address misgivings about her trustworthiness, by releasing decades of tax returns and more details about her health than Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  has. Yet one stain on her reputation is proving indelible: About seven in 10 voters say she did something wrong when she used a private email server as secretary of state, including 45 percent who say she did something illegal.\par \par \uc2 Concerns about her judgment linger even among some of her supporters, who say she could have been more forthcoming about her email practices before they grew into a political controversy and the focus of a scathing F.B.I. report.\par \par \uc2 ''I don't think she's been dishonest or untrustworthy in a way that disqualifies her to be president, but she shouldn't have worried so much about political ramifications and come clean up front,'' said Lindsay Dofelmier, 36, a lawyer in Houston who is supporting Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  has yet to release any of his tax returns, a break with political tradition that goes back decades, and has been far less specific than Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  on many personal and political questions, including his policy proposals. Asked if it was necessary for Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  to release his tax returns, 59 percent of voters said it was. Forty-five percent of voters said they would like the candidates to release more medical records.\par \par \uc2 Find out what you need to know about the 2016 presidential race today, and get politics news updates via \uc2 Facebook\uc2 , \uc2 Twitter\uc2  and the First Draft newsletter.\par \par \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  returned Thursday to campaigning in Greensboro, N.C., as a poll showed a tighter race with almost eight weeks to go.

\par\par \uc2 National Desk; SECTA\par \b \uc2 Trump\uc2  Again Refuses to Say Obama Was Born in the U.S.\b0\par\par\uc2 By ALAN RAPPEPORT; Amy Chozick contributed reporting in Washington, and Maggie Haberman in New York. \par \uc2 893 \uc2 words\par \uc2 16 September 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 16\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 WASHINGTON -- \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2  has refused again to acknowledge that President Obama was born in the United States, reviving the so-called birther issue that the Republican presidential nominee has played down since announcing his campaign last year.\par \par \uc2 The resurfacing of Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's doubts about Mr. Obama's birthplace -- in an interview with The \uc2 Washington Post\uc2  that was published on Thursday -- comes less than two months before the general \uc2 election\uc2  and as he has been working more aggressively to court minority voters.\par \par \uc2 Late Thursday, in an effort at damage control, a \uc2 Trump\uc2  spokesman issued a statement saying that ''Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  believes that President Obama was born in the United States.''\par \par \uc2 But the statement, by Jason Miller, a senior communications adviser, goes on to falsely blame \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  for starting rumors about Mr. Obama's birth in the 2008 campaign, and it then called her ''weak'' for not getting the question answered.\par \par \uc2 The statement actually credits Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  for settling the issue, saying -- again falsely -- that he ''obtained'' Mr. Obama's birth certificate, which the president released in 2011.\par \par \uc2 ''Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  did a great service to the President and the country by bringing closure to the issue that \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  and her team first raised,'' Mr. Miller's statement said.\par \par \uc2 But in The Post interview, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  said something entirely different when asked about Mr. Obama's birthplace.\par \par \uc2 ''I'll answer that question at the right time,'' Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  said. ''I just don't want to answer it yet.''\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , who spearheaded the birther movement, has repeatedly refused to bend on the issue, which deeply inflames black voters who take pride in Mr. Obama. Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's aides are trying to make the issue go away before the presidential debates begin this month.\par \par \uc2 In his interview with The Post, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  made it clear that his campaign staff does not always speak for him. He was asked specifically about comments by his campaign manager, Kellyanne Conway, who has acknowledged that Mr. Obama was born in Hawaii and has said that Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  privately agrees.\par \par \uc2 ''It's O.K.,'' he said of Ms. Conway on Thursday. ''She's allowed to speak what she thinks. I want to focus on jobs. I want to focus on other things.''\par \par \uc2 He will also most likely face questions about the times that he continued to express doubt about the president's birthplace, even after the release of the birth certificate.\par \par \uc2 In 2012, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  suggested that the documentation that Mr. Obama provided might have been fraudulent, saying in a \uc2 Twitter\uc2  message that ''an 'extremely credible source' has called my office and told me that @BarackObama's birth certificate is a fraud.''\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 Clinton\uc2  campaign is unlikely to let Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  off the hook at a time when he clearly wants to change the subject.\par \par \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  was quick to respond in a blistering speech, asking an audience in Washington on Thursday night, ''When will he stop this ugliness, this bigotry?''\par \par \uc2 ''He was asked one more time, where was President Obama born? And he still wouldn't say Hawaii,'' Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  said in an address to the \uc2 Congressional Hispanic Caucus Institute\uc2 . ''This man wants to be our next president?''\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's running mate, \uc2 Gov. Mike Pence\uc2  of Indiana, has also been unequivocal about Mr. Obama birthplace. Asked about it last week by NBC News, he said, ''I believe that \uc2 Barack Obama\uc2  was born in Hawaii'' and added, ''I accept his birthplace.''\par \par \uc2 For Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , clinging to ''birtherism'' appeared to be another sign that he does not intend to make a drastic pivot to attract a broader swath of voters, including members of minority groups who have been deeply skeptical of his campaign.\par \par \uc2 Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  made sure to emphasize the point Thursday night. ''Now, he has tried to reset himself and his campaign many times,'' she said in a speech in Washington. ''This is the best he can do, this is who he is.''\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  made no mention of the President's birthplace at his Thursday rally in Laconia, N.H., but he did gloat about starting his rally 30 minutes before his traveling press was set to arrive, calling it ''good news.''\par \par \uc2 Earlier, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  criticized an African-American pastor who interrupted him during a campaign speech at her church in Flint, Mich., on Wednesday, saying she was a ''nervous mess'' with a political agenda.\par \par \uc2 During his visit to Bethel United Methodist Church on Wednesday, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  gave a speech in which he criticized Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  as a failure. As he spoke, the church pastor, the Rev. Faith Green Timmons, walked over and said, ''Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , I invited you here to thank us,'' not to ''make a political speech.''\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  addressed the awkward exchange in an interview on Fox News on Thursday, suggesting that Pastor Timmons had a political agenda.\par \par \uc2 ''Everyone plays their games, it doesn't bother me,'' Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  said.\par \par \uc2 Find out what you need to know about the 2016 presidential race today, and get politics news updates via \uc2 Facebook\uc2 , \uc2 Twitter\uc2  and the First Draft newsletter.\par \par \uc2 This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.\par \par \uc2 Document NYTF000020160917ec9g0000f\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

After all that work, surely she deserves a day out. Brian Friel offers her one in this work, a playful epilogue to Chekhov in which Sonya (Dearbhla Molloy) of ''Uncle Vanya'' and Andrey (Dermot Crowley) of ''Three Sisters'' meet in a Moscow tearoom. \uc2 Irish Repertory Theater\uc2 , 132 West 22nd Street, 212-727-2737, irishrep.org. (Alexis Soloski)\par \par \uc2 'ALL THE WAYS TO SAY I LOVE YOU' (in previews; opens on Sept. 28) Not every actor can make the transition from situation comedy to serious drama. Judith Light has managed it with force and poise. In this solo show at MCC, written by Neil LaBute and directed by Leigh Silverman, Ms. Light plays a high school guidance counselor contemplating the directions her own life has taken. Lucille Lortel Theater, 121 Christopher Street, West Village, 866-811-4111, mcctheater.org. (Soloski)\par \par \uc2 'THE CHERRY ORCHARD' (in previews; opens on Oct. 16) The Tony-winning playwright Stephen Karam often writes in a laughter-through-tears Chekhovian tone. Now he lets this influence ripen with a new version of Chekhov's comic drama about an aristocratic family undergoing a crisis of love and real estate. Diane Lane stars as the long-absent matriarch, with \uc2 John Glover\uc2  as her brother and Joel Grey as a devoted servant. Simon Godwin directs. American Airlines Theater, 227 West 42nd Street, 212-719-1300, roundabouttheatre.org. (Soloski)\par \par \uc2 'THE ENCOUNTER' (previews start on Tuesday; opens on Sept. 29) Prick up your ears and put on your headphones for this unusual Broadway solo show, created and performed by Simon McBurney of Complicite, the London-based theater company. Inspired by the real-life tale of an American photographer's affiliation with a nomadic Brazilian tribe, Mr. McBurney enacts the story via live and recorded sound. Reviewing the London production, Ben Brantley called it ''one of the most fully immersive theater pieces ever created.'' John Golden Theater, 252 West 45th Street, 212-239-6200, theencounterbroadway.com. (Soloski)\par \par \uc2 'THE FRONT PAGE' (previews start on Tuesday; opens on Oct. 20) The director Jack O'Brien has assembled a headline-worthy cast for this revival of Ben Hecht and Charles MacArthur's coruscating comedic drama. Nathan Lane and John Slattery play tabloid reporters who chance on the story of their careers. With John Goodman, Jefferson Mays, Sherie Rene Scott and Holland Taylor. Broadhurst Theater, 235 West 44th Street, 212-239-6200, thefrontpagebroadway.com. (Soloski)\par \par \uc2 'HEISENBERG' (previews start on Tuesday; opens on Oct. 13) \uc2 Manhattan Theater Club\uc2  isn't feeling much uncertainty about the Broadway transfer of Simon Stephens's two-hander, directed by Mark Brokaw, a romantic drama about a man (Denis Arndt) and a woman (Mary-Louise Parker) who encounter each other on a train platform. Ben Brantley called the Off Broadway production a ''life-affirming mating dance'' and a ''probing work.'' Samuel J. Friedman Theater, 261 West 47th Street, 212-399-3050, manhattantheatreclub.com. (Soloski)\par \par \uc2 '\uc2 HOLIDAY INN\uc2 ' (in previews; opens on Oct. 6) Those dreaming of a ''White Christmas'' will cheer the Roundabout's stage adaptation of the 1942 Irving Berlin film that popularized the song. Bryce Pinkham, Corbin Bleu and Lora Lee Gayer star in this tale of a song-and-dance man who attempts to leave the stage for a rural hideaway. Studio 54, 254 West 54th Street, 212-719-1300, roundabouttheatre.org. (Soloski)\par \par \uc2 'LOVE, LOVE, LOVE' (previews start on Thursday; opens on Oct. 19) This decade-straddling play from Mike Bartlett (''King Charles III''), directed by Michael Mayer, questions the message of that Beatles hit. Is love really all you need? Richard Armitage and Amy Ryan star as members of the baby boom generation, with Zoe Kazan and Ben Rosenfield as their less explosive children. Laura Pels Theater, 111 West 46th Street, 212-719-1300, roundabouttheatre.org. (Soloski)\par \par \uc2 'NAT TURNER IN JERUSALEM' (in previews; opens on Sept. 26) Hanged, beheaded and very likely skinned, Nat Turner, who led a slave uprising in 1831, did not die an easy death. Nathan Alan Davis's play shows Turner (Phillip James Brannon) on the night before his execution, having one last conversation with his lawyer, Thomas R. Gray (Rowan Vickers). Megan Sandberg-Zakian directs the jailhouse colloquy. New York Theater Workshop, 79 East Fourth Street, East Village, 212-460-5475, nytw.org. (Soloski)\par \par \uc2 'THE ROADS TO HOME' (in previews; opens on Oct. 5) Primary Stages opens its season with this trilogy of Horton Foote one-acts set in 1920s Houston. Led by the actress Hallie Foote, the cast enacts melancholy-comic stories of women longing for a childhood home that recedes farther into memory each year. Michael Wilson directs. Cherry Lane Theater, 38 Commerce Street, West Village, 866-811-4111, primarystages.org. (Soloski)\par \par \uc2 'A TASTE OF HONEY' (in previews; opens on Sunday) Shelagh Delaney's sweet and bitter play, written when she was just 18, is being revived by the Pearl Theater. Set in England in the late 1950s, this tale of love in its many muddled forms is directed by Austin Pendleton and stars several members of the resident acting company. The Pearl Theater, 555 West 42nd Street, \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , 212-563-9261, pearltheatre.org. (Soloski)\par \par \uc2 'UNDERGROUND RAILROAD GAME' (in previews; opens on Sept. 26) In this fraught comedy, inspired by memories of an actual middle school history lesson, a pair of teachers use dolls and cardboard in an attempt to educate students about the nation's racial history and legacy. The play's stars, Jennifer Kidwell and Scott Sheppard, developed the piece with Lightning Rod Special. Ars Nova, 511 West 54th Street, 212-352-3101, arsnovanyc.com. (Soloski)\par \par \uc2 'WHAT DID YOU EXPECT?' (in previews; opens on Friday) The second play in \uc2 Richard Nelson\uc2 's ''The Gabriels: \uc2 Election\uc2  Year in the Life of One Family'' centers on a family in Rhinebeck, N.Y., confronting politics and culture around the dinner table. As an actual meal is prepared, the characters, played by Meg Gibson, Lynn Hawley, Roberta Maxwell, Maryann Plunkett, Jay O. Sanders and Amy Warren, discuss the coming presidential \uc2 election\uc2 . Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street at Astor Place, East Village, 212-967-7555, publictheater.org. (Soloski)\par \par \uc2 'WHERE DID WE SIT ON THE BUS?' (in previews; opens on Monday) Brian Quijada, the son of immigrants from El Salvador, sets an autobiographical tale to a hip-hop beat in this solo show. Inspired by a question he asked a third-grade teacher after a lesson on Rosa Parks, Mr. Quijada's play, directed by Chay Yew, describes an attempt to see the world in more than black and white. Ensemble Studio Theater, 549 West 52nd Street, 866-811-4111, ensemblestudiotheatre.org. (Soloski)\par \par \uc2 Broadway\par \par \uc2 'CATS' \uc2 Andrew Lloyd Webber\uc2 's splashy feline parade has returned, in a production once again directed by \uc2 Trevor Nunn\uc2  and designed by John Napier. Andy Blankenbuehler (''Hamilton'') has provided some new dances, but mostly this is the same ''Cats'' you saw (and loved or didn't) the first time around, albeit with a fresh and mostly terrific cast (2:15). Neil Simon Theater, 250 West 52nd Street, 877-250-2929, catsthemusical.com. (Charles Isherwood)\par \par \uc2 \u9733\'26\'05 'THE COLOR PURPLE' A makeover made in heaven. The director John Doyle has slimmed down and toned up a show that seemed leaden and garish in its original Broadway incarnation. This musical version of Alice Walker's celebrated novel about black women finding their voices -- which features Heather Headley and, in a star-making performance, Cynthia Erivo -- is a triumph of elemental, emotional storytelling (2:35). Bernard B. Jacobs Theater, 242 West 45th Street, colorpurple.com, 212-239-6200. (Ben Brantley)\par \par \uc2 \u9733\'26\'05 'FIDDLER ON THE ROOF' This timely new production of the much-loved and much-revived 1964 musical comedy honors the show's ebullience of spirit, as embodied in the Jewish milkman Tevye (an assured and affecting Danny Burstein), living in a Russian shtetl in the early 20th century. But as directed by Bartlett Sher with his customary sensitivity (''The King and I,'' ''South Pacific''), this multihued staging moves to a heart-stopping conclusion. It's just a musical, no?

Based on the 2003 movie, this story of a rock 'n' roll nerd (played by Alex Brightman, a bouncing Super Ball of energy) who teaches a class of regimented fifth graders (a fabulous band of preadolescents) to ''stick it to the man'' is as amiably easygoing as it is loud (2:20).

The score, by the pop singer-songwriter Sara Bareilles, is also beguiling, but Diane Paulus's production flattens the ancillary characters into cartoons (2:35).

No inhalation required: Just relax and put yourself in the hands of its young, four-member puppet-wielding cast, for whom goofiness is next to godliness (1:15). 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, 212-279-4200, 59e59.org.

As perceived realities dissolve, the one thing spectators can be sure of is that they are inside a production that is also a kind of art installation, and it is messing with them (1:30).

What follows is a wild mash-up of Shakespeare and pop-culture references that seems chaotically improvised but takes a deceptive amount of skill to execute. The audience sits right up against the action and sometimes gets drawn into it (1:30). The Lounge, Roy Arias Stages, 300 West 43rd Street, fourth floor, drunkshakespeare.com.

There are plenty of laughs but no overarching theme or point. It's a show aimed at parents, especially young mothers, who want to foster the idea that raising children is an impossibly demanding task (1:30).

In the Abbey Theater's delicately acted production, two men meet in a Belfast pub that was the site of a horror during the Troubles, when they were teenagers on opposite sides (1:15). \uc2 Irish Repertory Theater\uc2 , 132 West 22nd Street, 212-727-2737, irishrep.org.

Eric Tucker directs a wondrously mutable cast in a production replete with buoyant spirits and inventive do-it-yourself stagecraft (2:30).

But the tone of this improv-heavy play depends hugely on the performers. They lend an inclusive spirit of fun to the proceedings, set in a Manhattan hair salon where the audience determines which character is the most likely suspect (2:00).

\par\par \uc2 THE 2016 RACE\par \uc2 National Desk; SECTA\par \b \uc2 As Presidential Race Tightens, Here's How Forecast Models Differ\b0\par\par\uc2 By JOSH KATZ \par \uc2 993 \uc2 words\par \uc2 16 September 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 15\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Over the past three weeks, \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's chances to win the presidency have fallen. Her lead over \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2  has shrunk to between one and four percentage points nationwide, depending on which polls you count, and which candidates are included.\par \par \uc2 Here's one way to think about the race: Three weeks ago, a \uc2 Clinton\uc2  loss was about as likely as a missed 35-yard field-goal attempt in the N.F.L. Today, circumstances have moved that kick 10 yards farther from the goal line.\par \par \uc2 (And here's something for those of you yelling, ''Not another sports analogy!'' Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's chances of winning are roughly equal to the chance of drawing two consecutive cards of the same suit.)\par \par \uc2 Another way to think about it: In terms of the candidates' chances, we're in about the same place we were before the conventions. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  supporters should be about as concerned as they were two months ago, before the parties gathered. \uc2 Trump\uc2  supporters should be roughly as hopeful as they were then.\par \par \uc2 In The Upshot's model, Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's chances to win the presidency stand at 75 percent. Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , in just three weeks, has more than doubled his likelihood of becoming president. But his odds remain below those of Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Of course, The Upshot is not the only organization with a forecasting model. In addition to polling-based models from Daily Kos, FiveThirtyEight and the Princeton \uc2 Election\uc2  Consortium, there is the PredictWise model, which uses information from betting markets. Each model takes a somewhat different view of how the race has evolved over the past six weeks, as seen in the charts below.\par \par \uc2 Broadly speaking, each model moved toward Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  after the Democratic convention at the end of July, then stayed on a plateau for several weeks before drifting back toward Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 But there are differences. The PredictWise numbers, for example, tend to be more certain about the outcome in both directions -- giving Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  zero chance of picking off a conventionally red state like Texas, Alaska or South Carolina, and giving Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  zero chance of shuffling the electoral map and capturing a small blue state like Rhode Island or Maine.\par \par \uc2 The extent to which the lines move together shows how correlated the states are to one another. In some models, like FiveThirtyEight's, the states are very correlated; in others, like the Princeton \uc2 Election\uc2  Consortium, they are much less so. The Upshot's model lies somewhere between.\par \par \uc2 In general, states move in lock step from one presidential \uc2 election\uc2  to the next. The overall picture may change, but the states typically hold their positions relative to one another and swing together uniformly. \uc2 Election\uc2  cycles in which this does not happen tend to be aberrations -- 1976, for example -- or can signal an electoral realignment.\par \par \uc2 We've been in a remarkable period of electoral stability compared with previous eras. The eight least volatile elections since 1920 in terms of state shifts include the seven most recent.\par \par \uc2 In the 2012 \uc2 election\uc2 , only one state fell more than 10 points from its expectation, after controlling for home state effects: West Virginia, which voted 20 points more Republican than the nation in 2008, and then 30 points more in 2012.\par \par \uc2 While there are differences on the state level between the various models, the differences now -- as with two months ago -- are more about how the states will move together, and what that means for the distribution of possible outcomes.\par \par \uc2 The Daily Kos model foresees a more narrow range of plausible outcomes. The FiveThirtyEight model is centered in about the same place as our model is, but is shorter and flatter than ours, leading to a slightly lower chance of victory for Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 As I did at the beginning of this article, \uc2 election\uc2  analysts often fall back on the metaphor of sports odds: for example, saying something is analogous to a team leading by 14 points at the start of the second half or comparing a candidate's odds with making a field goal from a certain distance. It's a convenient way to get people to think probabilistically, which is not an easy thing to do. Trying to grasp what 75 percent really means out of context is hard.\par \par \uc2 But the football metaphor shouldn't be extended too far.\par \par \uc2 The difference between probability in sports and probability in an \uc2 election\uc2  is one of measurement. In a football game, all of the parameters are known. You can know that the home team is up by 7 points with 5 minutes 41 seconds to go, with a third-and-goal on the 1-yard line. Ignoring factors like team strength and weather, this tells you everything you need to know to make a simple forecast about who is going to win.\par \par \uc2 Elections aren't like that. We can't get a perfect representation of people's voting intentions, so we have to rely on polling. And polling is a messy business. There is often a lot of noise, and little signal. This was doubly so for the period before and during the conventions. When we said in a previous article that The Upshot's model is stubborn to move by design, we mean that it's somewhat inured to noise.\par \par \uc2 The situation with a political campaign is more like a football game in which you know how much time is left, but don't know the score -- you have to infer it based on how the home team's fans are cheering.\par \par \uc2 Now that the conventions are over and we're past Labor Day, the polls speak louder -- they contain more information -- so it's easier to get the model's attention.\par \par \uc2 The Upshot provides news, analysis and graphics about politics, policy and everyday life.

She's layering on even more complexity.''\par \par \uc2 His views were echoed by a number of tax experts I spoke to this week about Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's tax plans, as I did earlier about \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's.\par \par \uc2 In Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's favor, all the experts I interviewed said her proposals were more detailed, transparent and consistent than Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's and, even more important, would not blow open an estimated $10 trillion hole in the federal budget over a decade, as Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's proposals would.\par \par \uc2 ''It has the important virtue of being fiscally responsible,'' Leonard E. Burman, director of the centrist Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center and a professor at the Maxwell School of \uc2 Syracuse University\uc2 , said of Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's plan. ''It doesn't make our long-term fiscal problems worse.''\par \par \uc2 To varying degrees, all agreed that Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's proposal would increase taxes on the rich and big business but that it would add so many new layers of complexity that it would, above all, be a huge boon for tax lawyers. ''There's a lot of new complexity,'' said Mr. Burman.\par \par \uc2 Although Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's plan is intended to make sure that the wealthiest Americans pay more than they now do, it leaves intact loopholes that allow wealthy real estate developers like Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  to pay little or no tax, which could serve as a vehicle for sophisticated tax lawyers to exploit.\par \par \uc2 David Kamin, an outside adviser to the campaign on tax and budget issues and an associate professor at New York University School of Law, said that the campaign was ''taking a close look'' at provisions benefiting people like Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , and that her proposals did not purport to cover every loophole she might seek to close or change as president.\par \par \uc2 As for complexity, ''broadening the base and closing loopholes for the wealthy inevitably involve a certain amount of administration,'' said Mr. Kamin, who emphasized that her proposals would simplify returns for small businesses and people with modest tax burdens.\par \par \uc2 The experts generally praised Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's proposals to benefit small businesses, which include a provision that would allow them to immediately deduct up to $1 million in capital investments, which would ordinarily have to be depreciated. (Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  has also called for immediately deducting capital investments, but on an even wider scale.)\par \par \uc2 Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  has been frank in her acknowledgment that to pay for the many new social programs she has proposed, she needs to raise revenue, which she plans to do primarily through a tax increase on the rich.\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 Tax Policy Center\uc2  at the \uc2 Urban Institute\uc2  and \uc2 Brookings Institution\uc2  estimates that Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's tax plan would raise $1.1 trillion over the next decade; the Center for Federal Tax Policy at the more conservative \uc2 Tax Foundation\uc2  puts the figure at $498 billion, assuming no reduction in economic output from the tax increase.\par \par \uc2 Nearly all the increase would come from new taxes on the wealthiest Americans. For those with adjusted gross incomes of more than $5 million, she would impose a 4 percent surcharge on top of the normal tax system. For those with incomes above $1 million, she would install a 30 percent effective tax rate, a version of what has become known as the ''Buffett rule'' after \uc2 Warren E. Buffett\uc2 , the billionaire investor, complained that he paid taxes at a lower rate than his secretary. Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's plan would also cap the tax value of deductions and exemptions at 28 percent and raise the estate tax.\par \par \uc2 She would also close the notorious ''carried interest'' loophole that primarily benefits hedge fund operators and private equity managers, and, unlike Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , not give it back by means of tax cut on the wealthy taxpayers who take advantage of it.\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 Tax Policy Center\uc2  estimates that the top 1 percent of taxpayers -- those with adjusted gross incomes of more than $750,000 -- would face an average tax increase of $78,000, while the lower 95 percent -- those earning less than $300,000 -- would face little or no increase.\par \par \uc2 But over all, Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  has shied away from a sweeping tax overhaul. ''It's more tinkering at the edges,'' said \uc2 Alan Cole\uc2 , an economist at the Tax Foundation's policy center. ''I wouldn't call it reform. There aren't any major reformulations to make the code simpler or fairer. It's basically just a tax increase'' for the top income bracket.\par \par \uc2 It goes without saying that raising taxes on the rich while leaving most of the existing tax code intact is anathema to Republicans and conservative economists, as well as many centrist Democrats who have long held dreams of a bipartisan ''Grand Bargain'' to carry out a sweeping tax overhaul to improve the efficiency and competitiveness of the American economy.\par \par \uc2 ''I have admiration for the mechanics'' of the \uc2 Clinton\uc2  proposals, Mr. Holtz-Eakin said. ''They're more detailed and structured than \uc2 Trump\uc2 's. But I have serious concerns about the quality. Their philosophy seems to be to give up on economic growth and try to deliver middle-class prosperity by taking from the rich.''\par \par \uc2 Everyone I interviewed criticized as fiendishly complicated and ineffectual what is probably Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's most innovative proposal, which is to put in place a graduated scale for tax rates on capital gains.\par \par \uc2 Under Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's plan, taxpayers reporting capital gains held for one to two years would pay their ordinary income tax rate, which currently goes as high as 39.6 percent, just as they do now for gains held less than a year. Gains of two to three years would be subject to a 36 percent rate, and after that the rate would decline by four percentage points each year until it reached the current long-term rate of 20 percent. (All rates exclude the additional 3.8 percent surtax on net investment income.) In effect, there would be seven rate brackets for capital gains, compared with two under the current code.\par \par \uc2 Although this nominally raises capital gains rates for some assets, it is not clear what, if any, effect it might have on overall revenue. The \uc2 Tax Foundation\uc2  estimates that it would cost the Treasury $374 billion over 10 years because it would encourage investors to hold assets longer, which would defer their taxes. The \uc2 Tax Policy Center\uc2  says it would depress revenue in the early years as investors delayed sales, but would eventually add $84 billion over 10 years.\par \par \uc2 But the goal is not revenue; it's supposed to curb ''activist'' investors and others focused on short-term results, and persuade corporate executives to manage for the long term rather than for quarterly profit, according to a speech Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  delivered at \uc2 New York University\uc2  in July 2015.\par \par \uc2 However laudable the goal, using the capital gains tax ''is a misguided approach,'' said Mr. Burman (a view echoed by everyone I interviewed).\par \par \uc2 ''There's no empirical evidence whatsoever this would have any effect on management decision-making,'' Mr. Burman said. ''The real issue is corporate governance. It would be better if management faced more, not less, pressure from investors.''\par \par \uc2 How did such an arcane proposal, likely to appeal to a tiny sliver of voters, even make it into Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's tax plan?\par \par \uc2 The plan is lifted almost whole cloth from a paper published shortly before Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's N.Y.U. speech titled ''How to Foster Long-Term Innovation Investment'' by Neera Tanden and Blair Effron.\par \par \uc2 Ms. Tanden, a close confidante and former campaign worker for Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , succeeded the \uc2 Clinton\uc2  campaign manager \uc2 John Podesta\uc2  as president of the Center for American Progress, the think tank that published the paper. Mr. Effron is a co-founder of Centerview Partners, a Wall Street private equity and investment banking firm. Mr. Effron is also a major donor and fund-raiser for the \uc2 Clinton\uc2  campaign and has been mentioned as a potential Treasury secretary in a \uc2 Clinton\uc2  administration.\par \par \uc2 ''Secretary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  believes that American businesses need to break free from the tyranny of today's earnings report so they can focus on innovating and investing for the long term,'' said \uc2 Mike Schmidt\uc2 , an economic policy adviser at the \uc2 Clinton\uc2  campaign. ''That's what this proposal is designed to advance.''\par \par \uc2 Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's proposals also do nothing to address the corporate tax rate, which, at 35 percent, is the highest in the developed world (though few companies actually pay anywhere near that rate). President Obama called for reducing the corporate tax rate to 28 percent in a compromise rebuffed by Republicans, but Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  would leave it at 35 percent and try to extract even more revenue by closing various loopholes.\par \par \uc2 ''You'd think the business community would be up in arms over this, but I haven't heard a peep,'' said Mr. Holtz-Eakin. ''The focus on personalities has driven this off the radar.''\par \par \uc2 Several experts cautioned, as did the \uc2 Clinton\uc2  campaign itself, that Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's tax proposals might well evolve after the \uc2 election\uc2  should she become president.\par \par \uc2 Details aside, Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's tax proposals offer a stark alternative to Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's and send a clear message that a top priority ''is increasing the tax liability at the top,'' Mr. Kamin said.\par \par \uc2 ''The message is, that has to be a key element of any progressive tax reform. Beyond that, she has other priorities as well, such as simplifying taxes for small businesses and tax relief for working families,'' he added. ''But these are the key priorities, not a comprehensive list of every detail in the tax code that needs reform.''\par \par \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , arriving for the recent National Baptist Convention in Kansas City, Mo., has unveiled a tax plan whose increases would fall almost entirely on the wealthiest.

\par\par \uc2 OP-ED COLUMNIST\par \uc2 Editorial Desk; SECTA\par \b \uc2 Obama's Trickle-Up Economics\b0\par\par\uc2 By PAUL KRUGMAN \par \uc2 865 \uc2 words\par \uc2 16 September 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 27\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Only serious nerds like me eagerly await the annual Census Bureau reports on income, poverty and health insurance. But the just-released reports on 2015 justified the anticipation.\par \par \uc2 We expected good news; but last year, it turns out, the economy partied like it was 1999. And this tells us something very important -- namely, that a government that wants to can make American society more equitable, improving the quality of life for ordinary families.\par \par \uc2 The reports showed strong progress on three fronts: rapid growth in the incomes of ordinary families -- median income rose a remarkable 5.2 percent; a substantial decline in the poverty rate; and a significant further rise in health insurance coverage after 2014's gains. It was a trifecta that we haven't hit since, yes, 1999.\par \par \uc2 It's true that the surge in median income comes after years of disappointment, and even now the typical family's income, adjusted for inflation, is slightly lower than it was before the financial crisis. But the percentage of Americans without health insurance is now at a record low. And the overall performance of the Obama economy has given the lie to much of the criticism leveled at President Obama's policies.\par \par \uc2 Think back to the 2012 \uc2 election\uc2  campaign. There were already signs of the conspiracy-theory, bigotry-driven politics of this year's \uc2 election\uc2 ; \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  was loudly proclaiming that Mr. Obama's birth certificate was fake, and \uc2 Mitt Romney\uc2  eagerly accepted Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's endorsement.\par \par \uc2 But there was also something of a policy debate. Republicans accused Mr. Obama of being a ''redistributionist,'' taking money away from ''job creators'' to give free stuff to the 47 percent. And they claimed that these socialistic policies were destroying incentives and blocking economic recovery.\par \par \uc2 There was, in fact, a grain of truth in the first part of this accusation. Mr. Obama is no socialist, but since his re-\uc2 election\uc2  he has presided over a significant rise in taxes on high incomes. In fact, the top one percent is now paying about the same share of its income in federal taxes as it did in 1979, before Ronald Reagan began the era of big tax cuts for the rich. And some of the increased tax take is being used to subsidize health insurance for middle- and lower-income families.\par \par \uc2 Conservatives predicted disaster from these initiatives. Tax hikes on the rich, they insisted, would stall the economy. Obamacare's combination of regulation and subsidies, they declared, would kill millions of jobs without increasing the number of Americans with insurance.\par \par \uc2 What happened instead after Mr. Obama was re-elected was the best job growth since the 1990s. But family incomes, at least as estimated by the Census, continued to lag. So there was still some statistical basis for the right's Obama-bashing. Now that statistical basis is gone.\par \par \uc2 You might ask whether these numbers reflect reality. It's often claimed that Americans aren't feeling any economic recovery -- and if anyone were to ask Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , he would no doubt claim that the Census numbers, like every number he doesn't like, are cooked.\par \par \uc2 But be wary of polling on this issue. When Americans are asked how the economy is doing, many of them just repeat what they think they heard on Fox News: By large margins, Republicans say that unemployment is up and the stock market is down under Mr. Obama, the opposite of the truth. On the other hand, when you ask people how well they personally are doing, the Obama years have been marked by large improvements -- a sharp increase in the percentage of Americans who see themselves as thriving.\par \par \uc2 So the good news is real. And it should (but won't) finally break the grip of trickle-down ideology on much of our political class.\par \par \uc2 You know how the argument goes: Any attempt to help working families directly, we're told, will backfire by hurting the economy as a whole. So we must cut taxes on those ''job creators'' instead, counting on a rising tide to raise all boats.\par \par \uc2 It would be an exaggeration to say that the Obama administration has done the reverse, but there definitely was an element of trickle-up economics in its response to the Great Recession: Much of the stimulus involved expanding the social safety net, not just to protect the vulnerable, but to increase purchasing power and sustain demand. And in general Obama-era policies have tried to help families directly, rather than by showering benefits on the rich and hoping that the benefits trickle down.\par \par \uc2 Now the results of this policy experiment are in, and they're not bad. They could have been better: The stimulus should have been bigger and more sustained, and Republican opposition hamstrung the administration's economic policy after the first two years. Still, progressive policies have worked, and the critics of those policies have been proved wrong.\par \par \uc2 Read my blog, The Conscience of a Liberal, and follow me on Twitter, @PaulKrugman.\par \par \uc2 Follow The \uc2 New York Times\uc2  Opinion section on \uc2 Facebook\uc2  and Twitter (@NYTopinion), and sign up for the Opinion Today newsletter.\par \par \uc2 Document NYTF000020160916ec9g0005t\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 National Desk; SECTA\par \b \uc2 Recovering \uc2 Clinton\uc2  Returns to the Campaign Trail, Vowing New Approach\b0\par\par\uc2 By AMY CHOZICK \par \uc2 1,007 \uc2 words\par \uc2 16 September 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 15\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 GREENSBORO, N.C. -- A rested \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  returned to the campaign trail here on Thursday after three days of recovering at home from pneumonia, and vowed a different approach on the final stretch of the campaign, one more focused on her own positive vision for the country, rather than eviscerating her rival.\par \par \uc2 ''I want to close my campaign focused on opportunities for kids and fairness for families,'' Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  said after her first rally of her renewed campaign. ''I want to give Americans something to vote for, not just against.''\par \par \uc2 The shift in tone felt striking after Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  had spent months tearing town her Republican opponent, \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 But with less than eight weeks until \uc2 Election\uc2  Day and tightening polls showing a majority of voters dislike and distrust her, aides said it was imperative that Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  deliver a more uplifting message.\par \par \uc2 ''From now until Nov. 8, everywhere I go I'm going to talk about my ideas for our country,'' Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  said. Next week, Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  plans speeches to discuss how she would help young people and improve the economy, weaving in her own background as an advocate for children and as a first lady focused on women and families.\par \par \uc2 That focus was central in her address here at the University of North Carolina, where she took the stage to James Brown's ''I Got You (I Feel Good),'' seeming rested and revived, eager to tell the audience that her rare couple of days of downtime allowed her to ''reconnect with what this whole campaign is about.''\par \par \uc2 ''I'm running for all mothers and fathers trying to stay healthy so they can be there for their kids, but perhaps most of all, I'm running for those kids,'' she said. ''Standing up for children has been the work of my life, as a lawyer for the Children's Defense Fund, as first lady of Arkansas, in the White House.''\par \par \uc2 With just 54 days until the \uc2 election\uc2 , ''sitting at home was pretty much the last place I wanted to be,'' she said. But she called the time off ''a gift.''\par \par \uc2 Her return to the campaign trail comes as a series of polls suggest a closer race. Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  has faced a more disciplined Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  and scrutiny over her failure to initially disclose her pneumonia to all but a few close aides.\par \par \uc2 A New York Times/CBS News poll released on Thursday found her virtually tied with Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  among likely voters.\par \par \uc2 Asked about the narrowing gap with Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  on Thursday, Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  said, ''I've always said this is going to be a tight race.''\par \par \uc2 On her campaign plane earlier Thursday, a peppy-sounding Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  said she felt fully recovered. ''I am doing great,'' she said before takeoff in White Plains, N.Y., as she made her way down the aisle.\par \par \uc2 Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  flashed a wide smile at journalists studying her for signs of fatigue or illness and said she was looking forward to getting back into action. And at her rally later, she reflected on her time recuperating.\par \par \uc2 ''I talked with some old friends,'' she said. ''I spent time with our very sweet dogs. The campaign trail doesn't really encourage reflection, and it's important to sit with your thoughts every now and then.''\par \par \uc2 ''People like me, we're lucky,'' she added. ''When I'm under the weather, I can afford to take a few days off. Millions of Americans can't.''\par \par \uc2 Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  offered a rare public glimpse at her self-effacing humor, poking fun at herself for her plans that span ''38 different policy areas.''\par \par \uc2 She said, ''Like a lot of women, I have a tendency to overprepare.''\par \par \uc2 Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  did not entirely avoid criticizing Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , telling reporters after the event, ''We don't need someone who rushes out a half-baked plan just weeks before an \uc2 election\uc2  after decades of ignoring or putting down working moms.''\par \par \uc2 It was a reference to the child care proposals that Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  and his daughter Ivanka unveiled this week.\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 Clinton\uc2  campaign's efforts to put forth a kinder, gentler candidate began last week with a speech that Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  delivered in Kansas City, Mo., on her Methodist faith.\par \par \uc2 But the change in tactics hit an unexpected snag on Sunday when Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  abruptly left a ceremony to commemorate the 15th anniversary of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.\par \par \uc2 Amid intense scrutiny over Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's lack of transparency over her initial diagnosis, her physician, Dr. Lisa R. Bardack, later disclosed that Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  had been told she had pneumonia last Friday and that she had been overheated and dehydrated on Sunday.\par \par \uc2 Rather than making her case to the American people, Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  found herself recovering at home as her campaign confronted a series of distractions and dueling doctors' notes from her and Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 And she had to apologize on Saturday after a backlash over remarks she made at a Friday night fund-raiser in Manhattan in which she said that half of Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's supporters fell into a ''basket of deplorables'' -- bigots, essentially, of one sort or the other.\par \par \uc2 On Thursday, Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , when pressed about her handling of her diagnosis, appeared eager to put the rough patch behind her.\par \par \uc2 ''I didn't want to stop.'' she told reporters. ''I didn't want to quit campaigning. I certainly didn't want to miss the 9/11 memorial.''\par \par \uc2 ''It didn't work out,'' she continued. ''So I got the antibiotics up and going, got the rest I needed and we're going on from there.''\par \par \uc2 Find out what you need to know about the 2016 presidential race today, and get politics news updates via \uc2 Facebook\uc2 , \uc2 Twitter\uc2  and the First Draft newsletter.\par \par \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , after recovering for three days from pneumonia, held a news conference on Thursday at the University of North Carolina at Greensboro.

\par\par \uc2 Business/Financial Desk; SECTB\par \b \uc2 More Are Insured, but Obamacare's Future Is Very Much in Play\b0\par\par\uc2 By REED ABELSON and MARGOT SANGER-KATZ \par \uc2 1,291 \uc2 words\par \uc2 16 September 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 1\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Included among the many uplifting economic numbers released by the Census Bureau on Tuesday was a remarkable one about health insurance in the United States: Only 9.1 percent of Americans do not have coverage, the lowest level ever recorded by the agency.\par \par \uc2 That figure is down from 13.3 percent in 2013, before the major provisions of the health care law signed by President Obama went into effect. Another government study, released last week, looked at the first part of 2016 and found that the uninsured rate had fallen even further, to 8.6 percent.\par \par \uc2 So does that mean the Affordable Care Act is solving the puzzle of getting people covered, a major goal of the law?\par \par \uc2 It certainly looks that way. About 18 million more people have coverage now than did in 2013.\par \par \uc2 But the new numbers also highlight where the law is not working well -- and how difficult it will be to drop the uninsured rate much lower.\par \par \uc2 Many states have continued to resist the Obama administration's entreaties to expand their Medicaid coverage, leaving millions of poor Americans with no affordable health insurance options. And the marketplaces created under the law, in which middle-income people without insurance can buy policies, are struggling in states across the country.\par \par \uc2 Some insurers are dropping out, and others are sharply raising prices. In New York City, for example, rates for a benchmark plan could go up by an average of 16 percent, according to one analysis.\par \par \uc2 If the marketplaces do not stabilize, the drop in the uninsured rate could stall or even reverse.\par \par \uc2 Adding to the uncertainty is the hazy future of the health care law. \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2  and Republicans in Congress have vowed to repeal it if they get the chance. And even if the Democrats are in control, there is an array of competing proposals on how to adjust the law.\par \par \uc2 ''The way I would frame it is, this isn't just about whether the Affordable Care Act works,'' said Dr. Benjamin D. Sommers, an assistant professor at Harvard's School of Public Health and former researcher for the Health and Human Services Department, who has analyzed the remaining uninsured population. ''It's also about whether the effort to expand coverage has gone far enough.''\par \par \uc2 The Affordable Care Act was not intended to cover everyone, the way that single-payer systems in many other countries do. Undocumented immigrants, for example, are largely shut out of the health insurance system. And because the system requires people to actively sign up for insurance and often pay a premium, there will always be some Americans too independent -- or isolated -- to seek insurance.\par \par \uc2 But the law was certainly written to get insurance to far more people.\par \par \uc2 The Medicaid expansion, for example, is meant to expand coverage to all Americans earning below a set income threshold -- about $16,000 for a single person. Adoption of the program has been substantial. But the Supreme Court dealt a major blow to that plan in 2012. The court determined that states could decide whether to expand, and 19 have still declined to do so.\par \par \uc2 Those decisions leave more than three million people who are in poverty uninsured and without good options for obtaining health insurance. The law was written to give poor people coverage through Medicaid, not the private marketplace, so it does not provide financial assistance for buying coverage. The census report highlighted an increasing gap in the uninsured rates between states that expanded their programs and states that did not.\par \par \uc2 There is another large group of low-income Americans -- about nine million, according to recent calculations from the \uc2 Urban Institute\uc2  -- who are eligible for Medicaid or the related Children's Health Insurance Program but have not signed up.\par \par \uc2 The online marketplaces, which play a critical role under the law in reducing the number of people without coverage, also remain volatile. Fewer people than expected have signed up for plans through the marketplaces, and the enticements are not improving. Prices are set to rise substantially next year. And in many places, people who enroll will have fewer insurers to choose from.\par \par \uc2 Millions of people qualify for subsidies to buy into the plans. But many middle-class people who qualify for small subsidies have still found the plans to be unaffordable or a poor value. And people who make more and do not qualify for much or any government aid -- especially those who are healthy -- have been less likely to enroll. That has kept the mix of people in the pool sicker -- and more expensive to insure -- than expected.\par \par \uc2 ''These gains in coverage don't negate the need to make the insurance marketplaces sustainable,'' \uc2 Larry Levitt\uc2 , an executive with the \uc2 Kaiser Family Foundation\uc2 , which closely tracks the insurance market, said in an email. ''In fact, coverage needs to grow more, with additional healthy people signing up, to stabilize the individual insurance market.''\par \par \uc2 Insurers say it is imperative that the people who sign up are not just the sickest people. ''We need to encourage younger and healthier people to enroll,'' said \uc2 Alissa Fox\uc2 , a senior executive at the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association, a trade group.\par \par \uc2 Before the Affordable Care Act, most working-age Americans got insurance from their jobs, and that continues to be true. According to the Census Bureau, employer coverage has held steady since 2013. Many critics of the health law had predicted it would result in a huge drop-off in employer coverage. That has not happened. In fact, the persistent strength of employer coverage has been one of the reasons enrollment in the state marketplaces has not been higher.\par \par \uc2 On Wednesday, the \uc2 Kaiser Family Foundation\uc2  released its annual survey of employer health benefits. It found that the market remained stable, with no appreciable decline in the share of companies offering their employees coverage. While employees are typically paying a greater share of their medical bills, the cost of coverage went up modestly this year.\par \par \uc2 The future trajectory of the uninsured numbers depends largely on the results of the next \uc2 election\uc2 . Though the health care law may have come to bear President Obama's name, as Obamacare, its future will be shaped by the president who replaces him -- and by the next Congress.\par \par \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  has proposed an array of policies to expand outreach to the uninsured and increase financial assistance to middle-income Americans buying health insurance, policies designed to bring more people into the health law's programs. She has also proposed introducing public insurance programs for more Americans, including a Medicare buy-in for middle-aged people.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , in contrast, has said he would repeal the health law and move to a more free-market system for health insurance sales, a proposal that is expected to result in a substantial increase in the number of Americans without health coverage. Republicans in the House have put out their own health proposal, also built on a total repeal of the president's health law.\par \par \uc2 ''The stakes are huge,'' said Linda J. Blumberg, a senior fellow at the \uc2 Urban Institute\uc2 , who has suggested a series of policy changes to help expand coverage under the law. ''You couldn't be further apart in terms of the perspectives on what is needed here.''\par \par \uc2 Craig Dooley, getting an X-ray in Taylorsville, Ky., became eligible for expanded Medicaid coverage under the Affordable Care Act.

Trade It.\b0\par\par\uc2 By JOHN STUBBS and RICARDO REYES \par \uc2 961 \uc2 words\par \uc2 16 September 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 27\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Washington -- Republican voters who refuse to vote for \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2  are in a bind. They could vote for \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , but that means supporting a candidate whose positions likely run counter to their beliefs. Or they could vote for \uc2 Gary Johnson\uc2 , the Libertarian candidate, whose positions might be closer to their own but who stands almost no chance of winning a single state, let alone the White House.\par \par \uc2 Fortunately, there's a precedent, and a solution: vote trading, which was first attempted during the 2000 \uc2 election\uc2  and which, thanks to today's more robust internet, could make all the difference in a tight race.\par \par \uc2 Sixteen years ago, the concern was that votes for the left-leaning third-party candidate, Ralph Nader, could siphon off critical support for Al Gore in swing states like Florida. Gore supporters begged Naderites not to ''throw away'' their vote -- an insinuation that Nader voters found offensive.\par \par \uc2 As the \uc2 election\uc2  neared, though, ''Nader Trader'' websites emerged. The idea was simple: A Nader supporter in Florida, where every vote mattered, could promise to vote for Mr. Gore -- and, in exchange, a Gore supporter in a Democratic stronghold like Washington, D.C., would promise to vote for Mr. Nader.\par \par \uc2 It was a good idea, but in 2000, it didn't work. Word didn't spread fast enough, and the internet was still in its infancy. But it's worth revisiting.\par \par \uc2 First, consider the size of the #NeverTrump Republican vote. In 2012 Ohio Republicans went 94 percent for \uc2 Mitt Romney\uc2 ; President Obama received 5 percent of their votes and 1 percent went to ''other.'' This year, because of Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's candidacy, the percentage of Republicans who have indicated they are voting for Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  or Mr. Johnson or are unsure is 18.2 percent.\par \par \uc2 The problem is that in many close states, the number of Republicans who say they will vote for Mr. Johnson or stay at home is larger than the difference in support for Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  and Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 . Again, in Ohio, if the \uc2 election\uc2  were held today, polls predict that Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  would win 6.1 percent of the Republican vote and Mr. Johnson would win 6.2 percent (the additional 5.9 percent is undecided). This could decide the \uc2 election\uc2 : The latest \uc2 Quinnipiac University\uc2  poll in Ohio has Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  up by a point, 46 to 45.\par \par \uc2 Gary Johnson\uc2  won less than 1 percent of the vote in Ohio in 2012. Has he done anything in four years to improve his lot with Republicans, other than forgetting (or never knowing) about Aleppo, Syria? The only reason for his rise is that so many Republicans back him as a protest vote against Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 At the same time, we hear from many Republican friends in our home states of Louisiana and California, as well as former colleagues here in Washington, that they would vote for Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  if their vote ''mattered.'' Too bad they are in deep red or deep blue states, in a system where a handful of states will decide the fate for the country.\par \par \uc2 In other words, it's 2000 all over again. Mr. Johnson could deliver the \uc2 election\uc2  to Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 . Would-be protest voters should choose tactically instead and become a \uc2 Trump\uc2  Trader.\par \par \uc2 Today our organization, R4C16, is starting the first online resource for \uc2 Trump\uc2  Traders, focused on five swing states: Florida, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Texas. Yes, Texas, where, despite the Lone Star State's recent history of being dependably Republican, there is momentum against Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 . Both The Houston Chronicle and The Dallas Morning News (a paper that has not endorsed a Democrat for president in over 75 years) have endorsed Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 The system is simple. If you are thinking about voting for Mr. Johnson and live in a swing state, contact a friend who is voting for Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  in a safe state, and trade. Or, since it's 2016 and not 2000, we recommend the new #NeverTrump app, which will organize your contacts into safe states and swing states, enabling an easy trade. The safe-state friend will vote for Mr. Johnson, and the swing-state voter picks Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 . Mr. Johnson still gets a vote, but not at the expense of a major Electoral College haul for Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Trump\uc2  trading is based on the honor system. But for that reason, it's also perfectly legal: It's simply a matter of voters publicly expressing their political preference, so it's protected by the First Amendment. After the 2000 \uc2 election\uc2 , the National Voting Rights Institute and \uc2 the American Civil Liberties Union\uc2  of Southern California brought a case on behalf of three Nader Trader sites -- Votexchange2000.com, Voteswap2000.com and Nadertrader.com -- resulting in a Ninth Circuit ruling in Porter v. Bowen that the Nader Trader exchanges in 2000 were constitutionally protected speech and conduct.\par \par \uc2 Republicans everywhere should show up to vote, and those in swing states should vote tactically, for Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , and for Republicans down ticket. But for voters who can't quite stomach pulling the lever for the Democrat, offsetting that choice with a pledged vote in another state may make all the difference.\par \par \uc2 By voting tactically in 2016, conscientious Republicans can still prevent the worst-case scenario: Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  taking over the White House, and the G.O.P.\par \par \uc2 Follow The \uc2 New York Times\uc2  Opinion section on \uc2 Facebook\uc2  and \uc2 Twitter\uc2  (@NYTOpinion), and sign up for the Opinion Today newsletter.\par \par \uc2 John Stubbs and Ricardo Reyes are the co-founders of R4C16 and former officials in the Office of the United States Trade Representative during the George W.

Most Americans have at some time in their lives been running on fiscal fumes and have postdated checks as they waited for a paycheck to be deposited. Many of us have also written an earlier date on checks. Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  is shrewd. If he was participating in a quid pro quo, he might have had reason to predate it.\par \par \uc2 The bottom line: The date on the check is not proof of when it was written.\par \par \uc2 HELEN A. BERGER\par \par \uc2 West Newton, Mass.\par \par \uc2 To the Editor:\par \par \uc2 Re ''\uc2 Trump\uc2  Unveils Plan to Expand Aid to Parents'' (front page, Sept. 14):\par \par \uc2 Your article about \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2 's proposal to help parents with child care says he ''stretched the truth'' when he claimed that \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  had no plan of her own and ''never will,'' even though the article notes that she announced just such a plan a year ago that guarantees up to 12 weeks of paid family leave to care for a newborn or a sick relative.\par \par \uc2 How this is ''stretching the truth'' and not simply telling a lie is a distinction the writers do not delineate.\par \par \uc2 The fact that Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  has, throughout his campaign, told lie after lie is partly enabled by such journalistic niceties.\par \par \uc2 KARL KLINGBIEL\par \par \uc2 Brooklyn\par \par \uc2 To the Editor:\par \par \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2 's policy statement on helping working mothers with child care was as detailed as anyone could want from a presidential candidate. I am sure that \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's spin machine is threatened by this policy and is working overtime to protect its perceived ownership of ''the women's vote.''\par \par \uc2 Looking toward the debate, I expect Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  to defeat Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  easily based on his debate skills and her track record. I also expect her spin machine to have an attack ready after her defeat. It can always pull out the ''misogynist'' wild card whenever it runs out of legitimate criticism of Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 SHEP FARGOTSTEIN\par \par \uc2 Memphis\par \par \uc2 To the Editor:\par \par \uc2 In ''The Paranoid Style in American Politics Is Back'' (Sunday Review, Sept. 11), Thomas B. Edsall devotes the entire article to the paranoia he says he finds among \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  and his supporters. I looked in vain to find a reference to a famous phrase declaimed by Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's opponent, \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , about a ''vast right-wing conspiracy'' against her husband, then-President \uc2 Bill \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , who was being investigated for his sexual encounters with Monica Lewinsky.\par \par \uc2 For Mr. Edsall to dwell on Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's alleged paranoia, and to ignore Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's paranoia, is to wear blinders.\par \par \uc2 NATHAN DODELL\par \par \uc2 Great Neck, N.Y.\par \par \uc2 To the Editor:\par \par \uc2 It is ironic that Republicans such as \uc2 Newt Gingrich\uc2  and \uc2 Rudolph Giuliani\uc2  are attempting to roil \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2 's supporters by warning that the \uc2 election\uc2  will be rigged. It is their party that is at the forefront of efforts to rig the \uc2 election\uc2 , as evidenced by its efforts such as gerrymandering, voter ID laws and reducing the number of polling places in order to suppress voting by its political opponents.\par \par \uc2 JOHN CASSON\par \par \uc2 Brooklyn\par \par \uc2 To the Editor:\par \par \uc2 Thanks to \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2 's campaign, I have become more religious. No, it's not that Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  espouses the biblical virtues of helping the widow, orphan, stranger and poor. It's just that I now pray to God every day that Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  will not be our next president.\par \par \uc2 HERMAN I.

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 To the Editor:\par \par \uc2 ''Powell's Emails Show Scorn for \uc2 Trump\uc2  and Irritation at \uc2 Clinton\uc2 '' (front page, Sept. 15) raises troubling questions about journalistic ethics in an age of hacking. \uc2 Colin Powell\uc2 , a former secretary of state, retired from public service and returned to private life and should have been allowed to publicly comment on the current \uc2 election\uc2  if and when he wished. It is unclear that it was a matter of public interest to know Mr. Powell's privately expressed opinions.\par \par \uc2 True, the hacked information was online for all to see, and other outlets had covered the materials. But I hope that editors of The Times, a ''paper of record'' that aspires to high ethical standards, debated in depth whether and what to publish.\par \par \uc2 When prominent outlets publish hacked information, it spreads to a far wider audience, the hacking is legitimized and the hackers gain greater attention, likely encouraging further hacking.\par \par \uc2 Leaks of information to which a person has access have their own ethical dilemmas, but hacks of private information are stealing and should be treated as such.\par \par \uc2 KAI THALER\par \par \uc2 Boston\par \par \uc2 To the Editor:\par \par \uc2 Here's some common-sense advice to the ''best and brightest'' politicians of either party: Don't blame the Russians or Julian Assange. Instead, don't put anything in an email that might embarrass you if it were made public. Make a phone call instead. Or just keep it to yourself.\par \par \uc2 ROBERT OURIEL\par \par \uc2 Pacific Palisades, Calif.\par \par \uc2 Document NYTF000020160916ec9g00034\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw272\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4080\pichgoal600

Earlier in the day, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  ducked a question about the president's national origins: "I'll answer that question at the right time," the Republican presidential nominee told the \uc2 Washington Post\uc2 . "I just don't want to answer it yet."\par \par \uc2 In the past week, \uc2 Trump\uc2  ally \uc2 Rudy Giuliani\uc2  and campaign manager Kellyanne Conway separately said that Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  believes Mr. Obama was born in the U.S.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Obama was born in Hawaii to an American mother and a Kenyan father in 1961, providing documentation of his birth during his 2008 campaign for office. However, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  and others questioned the validity of those documents and demanded the release of a "long-form" birth record from Hawaii -- something the White House did in 2011 to quell the false rumors and innuendo.\par \par \uc2 -- Byron Tau\par \par \uc2 ---\par \par \uc2 EMAILS\par \par \uc2 Clinton\uc2  Sympathetic\par \par \uc2 On Powell Messages\par \par \uc2 Democratic presidential nominee \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  declined to respond to harsh emails written by former Secretary of State \uc2 Colin Powell\uc2 , where he describes her in unflattering terms.\par \par \uc2 "I have a great deal of respect for \uc2 Colin Powell\uc2 , and I have a lot of sympathy for anyone whose emails become public," she said in an interview that aired Thursday on the Tom Joyner Morning Show. "I'm not going to start discussing someone else's private emails. I've already spent a lot of time talking about my own, as you know."\par \par \uc2 She also declined to say whether, if she wins, she would like President \uc2 Barack Obama\uc2  to withdraw the nomination of \uc2 Merrick Garland\uc2  for the Supreme Court. The GOP-led Senate has refused to consider the nomination, saying it should be made by the next president.\par \par \uc2 -- Laura Meckler\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=wjco20160916000130"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document J000000020160916ec9g0003c\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw272\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4080\pichgoal600

\par\par \b \uc2 Election\uc2  2016: \uc2 Trump\uc2  Is Heavy but in Good Health\b0\par\par\uc2 By Michael C. Bender   \par \uc2 465 \uc2 words\par \uc2 16 September 2016\par \uc2 The Wall Street Journal\par \uc2 J\par A4\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 Republican presidential nominee \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  is overweight and taking a drug to lower his cholesterol, but is otherwise in good health, according to a letter from his doctor that his campaign released Thursday.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  is 6 feet 3 inches tall and weighs 236 pounds, Dr. Harold Bornstein wrote in the letter. That means Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , who enjoys fast food and doesn't regularly exercise, is overweight, according to the \uc2 National Institutes of Health\uc2 's body-mass index calculator.\par \par \uc2 "I could lose a little weight," Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  said on "The Dr. Oz Show," which aired Thursday. "It's tough because of the way I live. But the one thing I would like to do is be able to drop 15, 20 pounds."\par \par \uc2 The health of Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  and his Democratic rival, \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , has received increased scrutiny because of the age of the candidates.\par \par \uc2 The New York businessman is 70 years old, and if he prevails, he would be the oldest newly elected president, eclipsing Ronald Reagan, who was 69 when he took the oath of office in 1981.\par \par \uc2 Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , who turns 69 in October, would be the second-oldest first-term president.\par \par \uc2 Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  released a two-page note from her doctor Wednesday. It showed the former secretary of state is in good overall health, coming off a pneumonia diagnosis and a near-collapse over the weekend while she was getting into her vehicle at a 9/11 memorial ceremony in New York. In the letter, her physician pronounced her healthy and "fit to serve as president."\par \par \uc2 Dr. Bornstein's letter said Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  is in "excellent physical health." The letter says he is taking a statin drug for cholesterol and low-dose aspirin.\par \par \uc2 Dr. Bornstein's letter was written in a more straightforward fashion than an earlier letter from December 2015 attesting to Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's health. In that letter, Dr. Bornstein said that Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , if elected, "will be the healthiest individual ever elected to the presidency."\par \par \uc2 In his TV appearance Thursday, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  told Dr. Mehmet Oz that when he looks into the mirror, he sees a man half his age, and compared himself to \uc2 Tom Brady\uc2 , the 39-year-old quarterback for the New England Patriots.\par \par \uc2 "I feel the same age as him," Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  said. "It's crazy."\par \par \uc2 Dr. Oz asked Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  a question related to one of the candidate's signature issues, illegal immigration: Does the U.S. have a moral responsibility to provide lifesaving care to undocumented immigrants? Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  responded that he would stop illegal immigration, so it wouldn't be an issue. "They'd only come in the country legally," he said.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=wjco20160916000096"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document J000000020160916ec9g0002m\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw272\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4080\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 Potomac Watch\par \b \uc2 Democrats' Deplorable Emails\b0\par\par\uc2 By Kimberley A. Strassel   \par \uc2 867 \uc2 words\par \uc2 16 September 2016\par \uc2 The Wall Street Journal\par \uc2 J\par A9\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 If the 2016 \uc2 election\uc2  is remembered for anything beyond its flawed candidates, it will be recalled as the year of the Democratic email dump. Or rather, the year that the voting public got an unvarnished view of the disturbing -- nay, deplorable -- inner workings of the highest echelons of the Democratic Party.\par \par \uc2 What makes the continuing flood of emails instructive is that nobody was ever meant to see these documents. \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  set up a private server to shield her communications as secretary of state from the public. She gave top aide Huma Abedin an account on that server. She never envisioned that an \uc2 FBI\uc2  investigation and lawsuits would drag her conversations into the light.\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 Democratic National Committee\uc2  and \uc2 Colin Powell\uc2  (an honorary Democrat) likewise believed their correspondence secure. But both were successfully targeted by hackers, who released the latest round of enlightening emails this week.\par \par \uc2 These emails provide what the public always complains it doesn't have: unfiltered evidence of what top politicians do and think. And what a picture they collectively paint of the party of the left. For years, Democrats have steadfastly portrayed Republicans as elitist fat cats who buy elections, as backroom bosses who rig the laws in their favor, as brass-knuckle lobbyists and operators who get special access. It turns out that this is the precise description of the Democratic Party. They know of what they speak.\par \par \uc2 The latest hack of the \uc2 DNC\uc2  -- courtesy of \uc2 WikiLeaks\uc2  via Guccifer 2.0 -- shows that Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  wasn't alone in steering favors to big donors. Among the documents leaked is one that lists the party's largest fundraisers/donors as of 2008. Of the top 57 cash cows 18 ended up with ambassadorships. The largest fundraiser listed, Matthew Barzun, who drummed up $3.5 million for Mr. Obama's first campaign, was named ambassador to Sweden and then ambassador to the United Kingdom. The second-largest, \uc2 Julius Genachowski\uc2 , was named the head of the \uc2 Federal Communications Commission\uc2 . The third largest, Frank Sanchez, was named undersecretary of commerce.\par \par \uc2 Keep in mind what an earlier leak revealed: a May 18, 2016, email from an outside lawyer to DNC staffers in which the attorney suggests a call to "go over our process for handling donations from donors who have given us pay to play letters." Add this to what the \uc2 Clinton\uc2  and Abedin emails have shown to be a massive pay-to-play operation at the \uc2 Clinton\uc2  Foundation\uc2 , in which megadonors like the crown prince of Bahrain got special access to the secretary of state.\par \par \uc2 And there are also all those \uc2 Clinton\uc2  speeches, for which they were paid millions. News comes this week that despite the Clintons' promises to distance themselves from their foundation, they will first be holding what sounds like one last fire sale on future presidential access: a belated birthday bash for Bill \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , with a glitzy party at the Rainbow Room in Manhattan. A donation of $250,000 gets you listed as "chair" of the party, while "co-chair" costs $100,000. Foundation officials are refusing to say who has donated, or how much.\par \par \uc2 So which political party is all about money, influence and special access? The Republican Party held a true, democratic primary. Seventeen candidates battled it out, and the voters choose a nominee that much of the party establishment disliked.\par \par \uc2 Leaked emails show that the Democratic Party hierarchy retreated to a backroom to anoint \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  and then exercised its considerable power to subvert the primary process and kill off the Bernie Sanders campaign. In one email, Chief Financial Officer Brad Marshall suggested sliming Mr. Sanders on religion: "Can we get someone to ask his belief. Does he believe in a God. He had skated on saying he has a Jewish heritage. I think I read he is an atheist. This could make several points difference with my peeps. My Southern Baptist peeps would draw a big difference between a Jew and an atheist." How's that for deplorable?\par \par \uc2 Perhaps most revealing are Mr. Powell's emails, which show, undisguised, how \uc2 Clinton\uc2  supporters think. Specifically, the emails demonstrate that this crowd recognizes the Clintons as a menace -- and yet they are willing to excuse away anything. "I would rather not have to vote for her," Mr. Powell wrote to a friend. "A 70-year person with a long track record, unbridled ambition, greedy, not transformational, with a husband still [sleeping with] bimbos at home."\par \par \uc2 Unpack that. Mr. Powell is saying that Hillary is old; that she is a scandal factory; that she will cut any corner to win and do anything for a buck; that she won't help the country; and that her husband remains a liability. And yet other emails suggest Mr. Powell nonetheless was (is?) debating giving her a boost with a well-timed endorsement in the fall.\par \par \uc2 This is the modern Democratic Party. The more it has struggled to sell its ideas to the public, the more it has turned to rigging the system to its political benefit. Don't take Republicans' word for it. Just read the emails.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=wjco20160916000053"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document J000000020160916ec9g0001f\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 Metropolitan Desk; SECTA\par \b \uc2 Jury Is Picked in Bridge Case as Opinions About Christie Are Aired\b0\par\par\uc2 By KATE ZERNIKE \par \uc2 1,031 \uc2 words\par \uc2 15 September 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 20\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 CORRECTION APPENDEDNEWARK -- The jury of seven women and five men that will decide whether a political scandal involving the closing of approach lanes at the George Washington Bridge rose to the level of a federal crime includes a certified paralegal who lives in the same town as \uc2 Gov. Chris Christie\uc2  of New Jersey and says she does not like him.\par \par \uc2 ''My grandmother loathes him,'' the woman, who writes a blog about cooking and weight loss, said during questioning by Judge Susan D. Wigenton.\par \par \uc2 Another juror is a retired special education teacher who recalled her wife being unhappy about the lane closings, which crippled traffic on the New Jersey side of the bridge for four days starting on the first day of school in September 2013. And an alternate juror described the governor as an ''irrational fool,'' saying that in his interactions with the public, ''he seems like he's just jumping down people's throats.''\par \par \uc2 Prosecutors and defense lawyers declined to comment on the final makeup of the jury on Wednesday, but the defense in particular seemed happy -- expressing visible disappointment only when the government eliminated a well-read librarian who had written on her jury questionnaire that ''it should be \uc2 Chris Christie\uc2  on trial.''\par \par \uc2 While the defense was allowed 14 strikes against potential jurors, it exercised only eight before saying it was satisfied with the panel. Prosecutors used all but one of their nine strikes.\par \par \uc2 The two days of jury selection in Federal District Court here underscored how much the case is about Mr. Christie, even though he is not charged and has repeatedly tried to disassociate himself from the lane-closing scheme.\par \par \uc2 Prosecutors say the two defendants on trial -- \uc2 Bill Baroni\uc2  and Bridget Anne Kelly, both close allies of Mr. Christie, a Republican -- used the governor's office and the \uc2 Port Authority of New York and New Jersey\uc2  , which runs the bridge, as arms of \uc2 Mr. Christie's\uc2  re-\uc2 election\uc2  campaign, to reward mayors who endorsed him and punish those who did not.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Baroni and Ms. Kelly, prosecutors say, conspired to shut down the lanes as retribution against the mayor of Fort Lee, N.J., the town where traffic was gridlocked, then covered it up for months until a legislative subpoena revealed an email from Ms. Kelly calling for ''some traffic problems in Fort Lee.''\par \par \uc2 Lawyers for Ms. Kelly, once a deputy chief of staff and loyal soldier and friend to Mr. Christie, will try to separate her from him, and to persuade the jury that it was improbable that she had the power or the inclination to carry out any kind of political retribution, or to engage the \uc2 Port Authority\uc2  's vast resources to cover it up. The real scheming, they have argued, happened above her head.\par \par \uc2 Ms. Kelly, a divorced mother of four children who has been unemployed since Mr. Christie fired her in January 2014 after the email surfaced, also wants to stir sympathy, and may be helped by a pool tilted toward women. (Judge Wigenton chided a male prosecutor who did not understand a juror who said her hobby was ''crafting towels.'' You take a towel and put lace or other embellishments on it, the woman explained. ''You're such a man,'' the judge told the prosecutor.)\par \par \uc2 Mr. Baroni, who was \uc2 Mr. Christie's\uc2  top staff appointee at the \uc2 Port Authority\uc2  , is trying to separate himself not only from Mr. Christie but also from \uc2 David Wildstein\uc2 , a former friend whom Mr. Baroni hired to be a kind of enforcer at the agency. Mr. Wildstein, who had previously written a gossipy anonymous political blog in New Jersey, received Ms. Kelly's email -- ''Got it,'' he replied -- and has pleaded guilty in the lane-closings case in exchange for his cooperation.\par \par \uc2 Lawyers for both defendants have said their clients will testify. ''We are looking forward to clearing Bill's name,'' said Michael Baldassare, a lawyer for Mr. Baroni.\par \par \uc2 Among the other jurors are at least two who said they had participated in political campaigns; one has a brother who worked for President Obama. There is a product manager for an environmental company, a retired camcorder repairman, a retired dietary aide at a veteran's hospital and an unemployed chef who indicated that his hobbies included ''finding great deals at the supermarket.''\par \par \uc2 The judge did not release a copy of the questionnaire potential jurors had to complete. It had 85 questions, and lawyers said it borrowed heavily from those used in the political corruption trials of Bob McDonnell, the former Virginia governor, and William J. Jefferson, a former congressman from Louisiana.\par \par \uc2 The questionnaire included a list of about 250 names of people expected to either be mentioned or to testify at the trial. Lawyers for Mr. Baroni eliminated a potential juror who said she was a family friend of one person on the list: \uc2 William Palatucci\uc2  , one of \uc2 Mr. Christie's\uc2  closest political advisers.\par \par \uc2 The judge excused three supporters of Mr. Christie who indicated that they thought the trial was politically biased, and one who said he had supported Mr. Christie but had changed his opinion once the governor endorsed Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2  for president. (All said they could not be impartial. By contrast, the paralegal who said she did not like Mr. Christie said, ''I would like to give everyone the benefit of the doubt.'')\par \par \uc2 The judge has said she expects the trial to last six weeks. Opening statements are scheduled for Monday.\par \par \uc2 Correction: September 23, 2016, Friday\par \par \uc2 This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: Because of an editing error, an article on Sept. 15 about jury selection in the trial over the George Washington Bridge lane closing scandal misstated, in some editions, the date a woman from the same town as Gov. Chris Christie's was interviewed by the judge. It was Tuesday, Sept. 13 -- not Wednesday, Sept. 14.\par \par \uc2 Bill Baroni and Bridget Anne Kelly, former allies of Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey, are on trial in the George Washington Bridge lane-closing case.

\par\par \uc2 National Desk; SECTA\par \b \uc2 A Rebounding Economy Remains Fragile for Many\b0\par\par\uc2 By BINYAMIN APPELBAUM, PATRICIA COHEN and JACK HEALY; Jack Healy reported from Denver. \par \uc2 1,637 \uc2 words\par \uc2 15 September 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 1\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 CORRECTION APPENDEDWASHINGTON -- The eye-popping improvement in economic fortunes last year raises the question: If incomes are up and poverty is down, why is \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's message of economic decay resonating so broadly?\par \par \uc2 The answer is in plain sight. While the economy finally is moving in the right direction, the real incomes of most American households still are smaller than in the late 1990s. And large swaths of the country -- rural America, industrial centers in the Rust Belt and Appalachia -- are lagging behind.\par \par \uc2 ''We ain't feeling too much of all that economic growth that I heard was going on, patting themselves on the back,'' said Ralph Kingan, the mayor of Wright, Wyo. ''It ain't out in the West.''\par \par \uc2 That bleak reality helps to explain why the good news the Census Bureau issued Tuesday about a rise in household income was greeted gleefully by economists but is unlikely to change the complexion of the presidential race.\par \par \uc2 The recent upswing is real. While economic growth has been modest, the expansion is now in its eighth year. The economy has added millions of jobs and incomes increased last year for households on every rung of the economic ladder. The economic gains have been particularly strong for people who live in the nation's large metropolitan areas and for those who have college degrees.\par \par \uc2 Yet the repeated assertions by Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , the Republican nominee, that the middle class is being decimated and the economy is in decline ring true to his supporters. Many Americans, even those who are prospering, remain pessimistic about the fragile recovery. \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , his Democratic rival, has been careful to acknowledge the economy's problems alongside its progress.\par \par \uc2 The economic dislocations of recent decades may be contributing to the polarization of the electorate, according to research by David Autor, an economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. By emphasizing the nation's economic troubles, the candidates are going where the voters are.\par \par \uc2 In a new paper, Mr. Autor and three co-authors found that voting patterns had shifted most in the parts of the country that lost the most jobs as a result of increased trade with China. The study, which focused on congressional elections, found that voters in districts with heavy job losses have tended toward ideological extremes, replacing moderates with more conservative or liberal representatives.\par \par \uc2 ''There is this undercurrent of economically driven dissatisfaction that works to the benefit of candidates who are noncentrist, and particularly right-wing candidates,'' Mr. Autor said.\par \par \uc2 In Wyoming's coal-rich Powder River Basin, where mines have laid off hundreds of workers in a wave of bankruptcies, workers scoffed at the reports of rising wages and falling unemployment.\par \par \uc2 Not here, they said.\par \par \uc2 ''We are waiting on the \uc2 election\uc2  with high hopes that we do get a Republican in there who does understand about working men and women,'' said Mark Perkins, 49, who shut down his electrical storefront in the coal town of Wright earlier this year as he lost once-plentiful jobs servicing mines and large generators.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Perkins said miners and their families had been streaming away from town as the unemployment rate in surrounding Campbell County soared to 7.5 percent in July, from 3.8 percent a year earlier. Families dropped keys on counters and bolted, Mr. Perkins said, leaving quiet streets and a deep resentment at the economic policies supported by President Obama and Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 ''I'm just doing small electrical jobs to dog-paddle my way through till Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  gets elected,'' he said. ''You're not going to see very many Hillary -- or Killary as we call her here -- fans. She was so vocal about putting us out of work and putting us down. We're the scum of the earth.''\par \par \uc2 Even in regions that are prospering, many workers have seen little wage growth in recent years. The rise in median income was driven mostly by increased employment rather than wage gains.\par \par \uc2 Cheri Klug, 56, works as a cashier at a \uc2 Walmart\uc2  in southern Minnesota, making almost $12 an hour. Her husband, Dave, 62, draws federal disability benefits.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Klug said life seemed to get a little harder with every passing year.\par \par \uc2 ''I see everything increasing except my benefits and my wife's wages,'' he said.\par \par \uc2 Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  has proposed an increase in the minimum wage to $12 an hour, which would modestly increase the couple's income, but Mr. Klug said he planned to vote for Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 . He likes the idea of a businessman in the White House, he said.\par \par \uc2 Moreover, he does not like the idea of a government-imposed pay increase. His wife has spent eight years climbing up to her current pay grade, he said, and it wouldn't be fair for workers who have just joined \uc2 Walmart\uc2  to be lifted to the same level.\par \par \uc2 David Pilot, 56, works as an analyst for a telecommunications firm in Colorado Springs. He said his pay had increased modestly in recent years, by no more than 2 percent a year. Before the recession, he said, he sometimes got 6 percent raises.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Pilot works in the service sector, as most Americans now do, but he said he was voting for Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  because of his promises to return industrial jobs to America.\par \par \uc2 ''I like the fact that he recognizes we are playing on an unlevel field,'' Mr. Pilot said. He added that he did not think globalization had done any harm to his own career, but that he knew other people who lost work when companies moved overseas.\par \par \uc2 Polls also show that Americans remain pessimistic about the nation's economic prospects. They are worried that the floor is going to fall away from under them, just as it did in 2008.\par \par \uc2 Last week, 26 percent of people surveyed in Gallup's poll of Americans' confidence in the economy rated current economic conditions as excellent or good, while 30 percent labeled them poor. Thirty-seven percent of those surveyed said their economic outlook was ''getting better'' compared with 57 percent who said it was ''getting worse.''\par \par \uc2 Sheryl Fetzer, 58, who lives in suburban Columbus, Ohio, said she missed the 1990s.\par \par \uc2 ''Everybody was fat in the '90s,'' she said. ''Everybody had money. It's not like that today.''\par \par \uc2 Not even in her well-groomed suburb? ''The grocery stores are full,'' she allowed. ''The mall is full. People are spending. You can say things look good. But I think we're about to have a big crash.''\par \par \uc2 The gloom is deepest, however, in the regions where the recovery has been weakest.\par \par \uc2 Sara Flynn, 55, says she is lucky to be living in ''God's country,'' otherwise known as Hebron, Ky., but she is still trying to regain her footing since her high-end design business collapsed in 2010 at the height of the recession.\par \par \uc2 She got a job paying $8.25 an hour as a cashier in a big-box store, working her way up to supervisor at nearly double the salary, but she hated it.\par \par \uc2 ''One day I just said 'I can't do this anymore,''' said Ms. Flynn, who quit last year. With a degree in architectural design and drafting and contacts in the business, she quickly moved to another job at a kitchen design store, but got laid off after six months when business fell off. Having learned how to type on an electric typewriter in high school, she is now taking a computer course at the Brighton Family Center, a nonprofit in Newport, Ky.\par \par \uc2 Ms. Flynn has four sons in their 20s. Two graduated from college and two did not.\par \par \uc2 ''The ones with the degrees have really good jobs,'' she said. As for two who have high school diplomas, ''Well, they're still living at home.'' One is juggling three different restaurant jobs, while the other works at a pizzeria and turned their yard into a makeshift service center where he fixes cars.\par \par \uc2 Ms. Flynn said her parents were ''dyed in the wool'' Democrats. Her father worked at G.E. for most of his life, designing airplanes, before retiring with a pension, while her mother raised six children.\par \par \uc2 But Ms. Flynn said she planned to vote for Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 . She said she had liked Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  ever since watching his television show, ''The Apprentice,'' and she believes him when he says he can ''make America great again.''\par \par \uc2 ''That's a bygone era, that's when America was great,'' Ms. Flynn said of her parent's generation. ''It hasn't been like that for me.''\par \par \uc2 Find out what you need to know about the 2016 presidential race today, and get politics news updates via \uc2 Facebook\uc2 , \uc2 Twitter\uc2  and the First Draft newsletter.\par \par \uc2 Correction: September 16, 2016, Friday\par \par \uc2 This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article on Thursday about workers who have been left behind despite the economic recovery misstated in one instance, and in some copies, the surname of a Colorado telecommunications analyst. As the article correctly noted elsewhere, he is David Pilot, not Platt.\par \par \uc2 Sara Flynn of Hebron, Ky., said she was still trying to regain her footing since her high-end design business collapsed in 2010. Her son Brad has turned the driveway into a service center. (PHOTOGRAPH BY TY WRIGHT FOR THE NEW YORK TIMES) (A19) CHARTS: Short View Better Than the Long: Last year, household incomes rose strongly, especially among those in lower income brackets. But looking at changes in income over a longer period, Americans in the bottom half were still well below where they stood at the turn of the century even as those at the top chalked up significant gains.

\par\par \uc2 Foreign Desk; SECTA\par \b \uc2 Myanmar Leader Finds Longtime Champion in McConnell\b0\par\par\uc2 By JENNIFER STEINHAUER; Mark Landler contributed reporting. \par \uc2 1,052 \uc2 words\par \uc2 15 September 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 12\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 WASHINGTON -- As Myanmar's pro-democracy figure and government leader, Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, makes her way through Washington's power centers this week, one face is particularly familiar: Senator Mitch McConnell, who has been watching her for decades, usually at great remove.\par \par \uc2 Mr. McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader, has spent nearly three decades trying to promote democracy in the country formerly known as Burma, about which he once lamented, ''I have never spent more time on an issue and made less difference.''\par \par \uc2 He has been a lead sponsor of every major sanctions measure against the Burmese government over the last 20 years and has worked quietly and tirelessly with several administrations to try to bring democracy to the country. In 2002, \uc2 Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi\uc2  wrote to thank him for his support in a letter she had secretly sent out of the country.\par \par \uc2 Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi\uc2  impressed Mr. McConnell with her steely resolve during years of house arrest, which kept her from visiting her dying husband, and her refusal to leave for countries offering refuge, the senator said.\par \par \uc2 ''She could have chosen the route of Gandhi and just been an icon,'' Mr. McConnell said in an interview Wednesday. ''Instead she chose the route of Margaret Thatcher by accepting responsibility by bringing along a country that was essentially in the dark ages.''\par \par \uc2 Mr. McConnell first took an interest in Burma the late 1980s and early '90s, long before most Americans had ever heard of it, when the military invalidated \uc2 election\uc2  results. ''It was a totally unknown cause,'' said Robin Cleveland, Mr. McConnell's former longtime foreign affairs adviser.\par \par \uc2 ''In the case of South Africa, there was a huge constituency in this country and a rallying call against apartheid,'' she said. ''Here, there were like three guys on the U.S.-Burma campaign who had been tortured, and that was it. It was his commitment to the person and the principle that drove him.''\par \par \uc2 Their relationship, which was fostered with phone calls and other correspondence over the years, grew closer in 2012 when Mr. McConnell visited her in Yangon, and \uc2 Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi\uc2  visited him in Kentucky later during her first visit to the United States.\par \par \uc2 Mr. McConnell's support is not unlike his early push for sanctions in South Africa, at the time unpopular with many Republicans, including President Ronald Reagan, and another component of the senator's longstanding interest in civil rights.\par \par \uc2 ''You can tell from observing him that the issue of Burma is deeply felt,'' said Derek Mitchell, a former ambassador to Myanmar, who encouraged the foreign minister to issue Mr. McConnell a closely held visa. ''There is a strong affection and commitment he has shown to her personally when he was driving sanctions.''\par \par \uc2 Mr. McConnell introduced the Burmese Freedom and Democracy Act in 2003, imposing additional sanctions on the Burmese government, which was adopted that year after \uc2 Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi\uc2 's motorcade was attacked by junta operatives. Further sanctions followed. In 2008, Mr. McConnell and Senator \uc2 Dianne Feinstein\uc2 , Democrat of California, introduced legislation to award her the Congressional Gold Medal.\par \par \uc2 In early 2009, when Secretary of State \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  was about to embark on a diplomatic outreach effort to Myanmar's military leaders, she went to see Mr. McConnell in his office first. Mr. McConnell was skeptical, she said, mindful of his importance to Burma policy, but acknowledged that the sanctions-only approach had not produced results. He grudgingly agreed to support her diplomatic efforts.\par \par \uc2 In 2011, Mr. McConnell talked to \uc2 Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi\uc2  for the first time, by telephone, and began to work with Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  and the State Department to re-examine the United States's relationship with the changing nation.\par \par \uc2 In 2012 the senator traveled to Yangon where \uc2 Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi\uc2  greeted him with an embrace on the front porch of the house where she had lived under house arrest for years. ''It was actually quite an emotional moment,'' he said.\par \par \uc2 Late that year, \uc2 Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi\uc2  visited Mr. McConnell in Kentucky during a packed trip to the United States. During a day of downtime that she had built into the trip, Mr. McConnell showed her horses, which he had learned she loved from childhood, in central Kentucky.\par \par \uc2 ''I wanted to come here because of Senator McConnell,'' she said, ''because I wanted to see what his home was like. I wanted to thank him for everything he did for us over, well, two decades. That's a long time.'' (She also got to finally collect her gold medal in Washington.)\par \par \uc2 On Wednesday, Mr. McConnell joined a small group of lawmakers at the residence of Vice President \uc2 Joseph R. Biden Jr\uc2 . for breakfast with \uc2 Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi\uc2 . One of them, Senator Bob Corker, Republican of Tennessee and chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, expressed the sort of impatience that some lawmakers and human rights advocates have expressed about her nascent leadership. Critics have faulted her reluctance to condemn the systematic mistreatment of Myanmar's Muslim Rohingya minority.\par \par \uc2 ''While we certainly appreciate the work \uc2 Aung San Suu Kyi\uc2  has done to ensure a democratic transition in Burma,'' Mr. Corker said in a news release, ''I am somewhat appalled by her dismissive reaction to concerns I raised this morning about the problem of human trafficking in her country.''\par \par \uc2 Mr. McConnell said ''inevitable disappointment'' with the pace of change, especially among her compatriots, was part of the less pleasant aspects of accountability that \uc2 Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi\uc2  had agreed to take on.\par \par \uc2 On Thursday Mr. McConnell will once again greet his friend at the Capitol, and he will continue to take her advice on how to proceed with sanctions. ''This woman is truly heroic,'' the senator said Wednesday, ''and it's so gratifying to see her today as, in fact, the head of state.''\par \par \uc2 Follow The \uc2 New York Times\uc2 's politics and Washington coverage on \uc2 Facebook\uc2  and \uc2 Twitter\uc2 , and sign up for the First Draft politics newsletter.\par \par \uc2 Mitch McConnell has sponsored every major sanctions measure against the Burmese government over the last 20 years.

\par\par \uc2 National Desk; SECTA\par \b \uc2 Prime Danger in Vote Hack: Sowing Doubt\b0\par\par\uc2 By DAVID E. SANGER and CHARLIE SAVAGE; Matthew Rosenberg contributed reporting. \par \uc2 1,856 \uc2 words\par \uc2 15 September 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 1\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 WASHINGTON -- Russian hackers would not be able to change the outcome of the United States presidential \uc2 election\uc2 , the nation's most senior intelligence and law enforcement officials have assured Congress and the White House in recent weeks.\par \par \uc2 But disrupting it, they acknowledge, would be far easier -- causing doubts in battleground states, prompting challenges to results and creating enough chaos to make Florida's hanging chads seem like a quaint problem from the analog age. By some measures, in fact, the disruption has already begun.\par \par \uc2 And meddling around the edges of an \uc2 election\uc2  could sow doubts about the legitimacy of the results -- especially in a year in which the Republican nominee, \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , has told his supporters that the only way he will lose is if the \uc2 election\uc2  is ''rigged,'' and while campaign officials for his Democratic opponent, \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , have held a series of meetings about preparing for the possibility that the vote will be hacked.\par \par \uc2 The White House has declined to name Russia publicly as the chief suspect in a series of recent hacks, and has worded its public warnings carefully. The greatest danger, Lisa O. Monaco, President Obama's domestic security adviser, said on Wednesday, is from attempts to cause ''concern or confusion'' about the voting system.\par \par \uc2 The systems most vulnerable to cyberattacks are large, centralized databases, where breaking into one part of the system can often give access to all of it. That is what happened to the Office of Personnel Management, which was unaware for more than a year as Chinese hackers stole credentials to get into its system, copied the highly sensitive security-review documents for nearly 22 million federal employees and contractors, encrypted the data and transmitted it out of the country.\par \par \uc2 By contrast, the American voting system, with its hodgepodge of state and local polling places, is protected by being decentralized and disconnected. ''That makes it extremely disparate, extremely diffuse and, as a consequence, extremely difficult to have an effect across the board that would result in a change in results,'' Ms. Monaco said.\par \par \uc2 At a meeting last week that attracted many of the nation's top intelligence leaders, the F.B.I. director, James B. Comey, described the voting system as ''clunky as heck,'' but a blessing ''because it makes it more resilient and farther away from an actor who might be looking to crawl down a fiber-optic cable.''\par \par \uc2 A recent attempt to steal voter registration rolls in Arizona by what the F.B.I. told state officials were Russian hackers, and a successful theft of voter information in Illinois, raised the question of whether the lists of registered voters at polling stations could be manipulated. One fear is that newly registered voters could be struck from the rolls. They could still cast provisional ballots, but the result would be long lines and delays. Another is that nonregistered voters, foreigners or felons who have been barred from voting might be able to enter the voting booth, leading to challenges.\par \par \uc2 The attempted breach in his state led Senator \uc2 John McCain\uc2 , Republican of Arizona, to charge in a Senate hearing this week that the Obama administration had been far too sanguine about the dangers facing the electoral process.\par \par \uc2 ''Any attempt to interfere with American elections must be treated as a threat to our vital national security interests,'' Mr. McCain said after questioning Adm. Michael S. Rogers, the director of the National Security Agency, at the hearing. ''Yet so far, the only response from the Obama administration has been a warning from the secretary of defense.''\par \par \uc2 It is unclear if Mr. Obama raised the issue with President \uc2 Vladimir V. Putin\uc2  of Russia when they met 10 days ago in China. If an F.B.I. investigation finds overwhelming evidence of Russian government responsibility in the hacking of the \uc2 Democratic National Committee\uc2  or other recent breaches, the president would have to decide whether or how to respond.\par \par \uc2 Any response may not be made public, since Mr. Putin is seen as responding better to private warnings, or demonstrations of retaliation, than to anything that openly challenges his authority.\par \par \uc2 One reason officials like Mr. Comey have expressed confidence in the security of the vote is that most states (Pennsylvania is a notable exception) keep a paper backup of votes as they are cast. Paper trails are not foolproof. But their existence means that after a lengthy audit -- even one as politically paralyzing as the 2000 recount in Florida -- an accurate count would probably be made.\par \par \uc2 Voting machines are not supposed to be connected to the internet (though there are some exceptions), providing some additional measure of protection. But results are reported online, and one fear that federal cyberexperts have discussed is that a sophisticated ''man in the middle'' attack could allow hackers to take over internet systems used to report unofficial results on \uc2 election\uc2  night. Such a breach might not alter the official ballot count, but it could sow deep mistrust about the numbers that are broadcast.\par \par \uc2 ''If I were a bad guy, I know I could manipulate the system,'' said \uc2 Stuart McClure\uc2 , the author of ''Hacking Exposed'' and the chief executive of Cylance, a company that uses artificial intelligence techniques to repel attacks on networks. ''But the problem here is not really about manipulation. It's about the damage you can do with disruption, so that people lose confidence in the system.''\par \par \uc2 Mr. McClure likened the problem to causing a blackout that would bring down part of a power grid. Chaos ensues, but eventually power is restored. The difference is that the nation's utilities now conduct twice-yearly ''stress tests'' of their resilience.\par \par \uc2 But the voting system has never been designated ''critical infrastructure'' by the \uc2 Department of Homeland Security\uc2 , something it suggested recently may soon change. And only a few states have even tried to subject their voting systems to a serious test attack, called ''red teaming,'' by the military and intelligence agencies that regularly try to replicate how the systems would hold up against a sophisticated cyberattacker.\par \par \uc2 The two states that have conducted the most comprehensive top-to-bottom reviews of their voting systems, drawing on computer scientists, are California and Ohio. But those largely involved systemic audits, and they took place in 2007 -- almost another era in the world of cybersecurity. And many other states have not even gone that far.\par \par \uc2 So far, the kinds of attacks on voting machines themselves have seemed pretty unsophisticated -- they would embarrass any serious hacker working for Russia's old K.G.B., now called the F.S.B. -- but have sometimes been extremely effective.\par \par \uc2 In Clay County, Ky., eight local \uc2 election\uc2  officials were convicted in 2010 of fooling voters who used ''iVotronic'' \uc2 election\uc2  machines, which resemble A.T.M.s. After casting their ballots, the voters pressed a big red button on a screen marked ''Vote.'' But some of the machines then required the voter to touch another button, ''Confirm Vote.''\par \par \uc2 The officials were accused of trying to hide this last fact from voters, having them leave the booth as soon as they touched ''Vote.'' When they left, the officials would review and sometimes change the votes, then confirm the selection.\par \par \uc2 The fraud left no paper trail and preyed on voters unfamiliar with the machines. But it also required hands-on tinkering with the actual machines. And since the machines are offline, that could not be done en masse, or from afar.\par \par \uc2 Keeping voting machines off a network is critical, but it is hardly a guarantee against hacking. The Iranians kept their nuclear centrifuges off any network, and it did not stop the United States and Israel from putting malware in the system -- but again, it was a single, central system.\par \par \uc2 And there have been some isolated cases where states discovered they had machines that were not as insulated from the networked world as they thought. Last year, Virginia decertified the use of a certain brand of voting machines that had a wireless internet capcity, said Lawrence Norden of New York University's Brennan Center for Justice. He said he was unaware of any equipment currently in use that still had that vulnerability.\par \par \uc2 ''When you think about someone in Moscow hacking into the voter registration database or D.N.C. email server, they are not going to be able to do that for voting machines'' because they would have to gain access to each machine, said Mr. Norden, who has written several reports about \uc2 election\uc2  systems as deputy director of the Brennan Center's Democracy Program.\par \par \uc2 After the initial attack on the \uc2 Democratic National Committee\uc2 , the \uc2 Department of Homeland Security\uc2  began offering states a ''computer hygiene'' check that would automatically scan the internet addresses of any networked servers an \uc2 election\uc2  agency uses. That scan would look for malware or vulnerabilities, and the department would assist in patching them. The department will also send half a dozen or so specialists to the \uc2 election\uc2  agency's facility to perform a risk and vulnerability assessment.\par \par \uc2 The department also intends to have specialists working on \uc2 election\uc2  night at its National Cybersecurity and Communications Integration Center, which serves as a clearinghouse for information about cyberattacks.\par \par \uc2 So far, at least nine states have reached out to the department for consultations, the agency said.\par \par \uc2 The issue traces back to the botched 2000 vote count in Florida. The ''hanging chads'' defeated electronic vote-reading machines: The tiny bit of punched-out cardboard remained, and the machines could not count them accurately. Sometimes alternative systems are just as bad. While optical scanners avoid the chad problem, they can be confused when voters fill in the oval of a preferred candidate and then circle it for emphasis.\par \par \uc2 The first versions of A.T.M.-style touch-screen machines did not produce backup printouts, and many of those machines are still in service around the country. That makes it impossible to conduct a meaningful audit. \uc2 Election\uc2  officials and voter integrity advocates have been studying such gaps and trying to fix them over the past decade.\par \par \uc2 Still, some states have lagged, in part because buying new machines can be costly. Several other states, including Virginia and Florida, still have a few paperless machines available to provide special access to voters with vision problems.\par \par \uc2 Until recently, said \uc2 Pamela Smith\uc2 , the president of Verified Voting, a San Diego-based nonprofit that advocates improvements to voting equipment and systems, a manipulated \uc2 election\uc2  seemed more like a theoretical problem than a real possibility.\par \par \uc2 But the hacking of the \uc2 Democratic National Committee\uc2 's internal emails and of voter registration databases in Arizona and Illinois has focused minds.\par \par \uc2 ''It's a reality check for the whole country,'' Ms. Smith said.\par \par \uc2 Attacks on voting machines have so far seemed relatively unsophisticated.

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 The largest arm of the \uc2 Bill, Hillary & Chelsea \uc2 Clinton\uc2  Foundation\uc2  will spin off into an independent organization if \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  is elected president, the charity said Wednesday in the latest effort by the foundation and the campaign to alleviate concerns about potential conflicts of interest.\par \par \uc2 If Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  wins in November, former President \uc2 Bill \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , \uc2 Chelsea \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , Bruce Lindsey, Ira C. Magaziner and \uc2 Maggie Williams\uc2  will all step down from the board of the charity, the \uc2 Clinton\uc2  Health Access Initiative, or CHAI, which was established in 2002 to improve access to AIDS drugs around the world.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Magaziner, who is a longtime friend and adviser to the Clintons, will eventually be replaced as chief executive once a succession plan is established, the charity said.\par \par \uc2 Under the arrangement, the initiative would be known solely as CHAI. The \uc2 Clinton\uc2  name would no longer be used, and the \uc2 Clinton\uc2  Foundation\uc2  would no longer have the power to appoint members to its board.\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 Clinton\uc2  Foundation\uc2  has faced heightened scrutiny in recent months over its acceptance of foreign and corporate donations and allegations that the money may have influenced Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  as secretary of state.\par \par \uc2 Last month, Mr. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  announced that the foundation would no longer accept foreign or corporate money and that he would resign from its board should Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  win the presidency. CHAI did not make that promise at the time, so its announcement Wednesday was intended ease concerns about the biggest entity related to the foundation taking foreign money or having \uc2 Clinton\uc2  family members on its board if Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  wins the White House.\par \par \uc2 The foundation is also ending its annual \uc2 Clinton\uc2  Global Initiative conference after its final gathering in New York next week.\par \par \uc2 Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  resigned from the board of the \uc2 Clinton\uc2  Foundation\uc2  in April 2015 in preparation for her presidential bid.\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 Trump\uc2  campaign said Wednesday that the changes did not go far enough and described the announcement as a public relations ''gimmick designed to distract from the mounting \uc2 Clinton\uc2  Foundation\uc2  controversies.''\par \par \uc2 Jason Miller, a spokesman for Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , said that the foundation should return every penny it had received from foreign countries to completely eliminate the prospect of undue influence, and warned that the Clintons could still be compromised through the \uc2 election\uc2  by accepting such donations.\par \par \uc2 ''The continued flow of foreign donations to the Clintons' network of foundations while \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  runs for the presidency is unacceptable, and every contribution from overseas only further compromises her ability to serve,'' Mr. Miller said.\par \par \uc2 Find out what you need to know about the 2016 presidential race today, and get politics news updates via \uc2 Facebook\uc2 , \uc2 Twitter\uc2  and the First Draft newsletter.\par \par \uc2 Document NYTF000020160915ec9f0004r\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 National Desk; SECTA\par \b \uc2 Trump\uc2  Says He Is Overweight, and \uc2 Clinton\uc2  Is Reported to Be Recovering\b0\par\par\uc2 By AMY CHOZICK and MAGGIE HABERMAN; Lawrence K. Altman contributed reporting. \par \uc2 1,627 \uc2 words\par \uc2 15 September 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 16\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 With less than eight weeks until \uc2 Election\uc2  Day and pressure mounting for the candidates to give details about their health and medical histories, \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2  acknowledged on Wednesday that he was overweight and taking a cholesterol-fighting drug, and \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  elaborated on the circumstances that led to her contracting pneumonia and the medicine she was taking to recover.\par \par \uc2 Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's doctor said she ''continues to improve'' after contracting a ''mild, noncontagious'' form of pneumonia diagnosed on Friday, two days before she grew dizzy and was seen losing her footing while leaving a ceremony for the 15th anniversary of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.\par \par \uc2 In a letter released by the \uc2 Clinton\uc2  campaign, the physician, Dr. Lisa R. Bardack, said she had evaluated Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  several times since Sunday, including on Wednesday. ''She is recovering well with antibiotics and rest,'' Dr. Bardack said. ''She continues to remain healthy and fit to serve as president of the United States.''\par \par \uc2 After Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  left Sunday's Sept. 11 ceremony early, a spokesman initially said only that she had felt overheated. But after video shot by an onlooker showed Secret Service agents helping a wobbly Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  into a van, her campaign released a statement from Dr. Bardack saying that Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  had pneumonia.\par \par \uc2 Since then, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's campaign has urged supporters to refrain from talking about Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's health, a frequent topic of speculation among some Republicans before her pneumonia diagnosis. But at a rally in Ohio on Wednesday night, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  said he hoped Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  was improving but added that she was ''lying in bed.''\par \par \uc2 He also noted his ability to keep standing in an overheated room. ''I don't know, folks,'' he said. ''Do you think Hillary would be able to stand up here for an hour?''\par \par \uc2 Despite fanning conspiracy theories about Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's health, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  provided scant information about his own. On Wednesday, he taped an appearance on Dr. Mehmet Oz's daytime television show in which he discussed his health to some degree, including the results of a physical last week, according to people present for the taping and a clip released by the show's publicists.\par \par \uc2 But little information was available about what was said on the show, which will be broadcast on Thursday, other than that Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , 70, said he was taking regular doses of a statin, a drug that lowers cholesterol, and gave his weight as 236 pounds.\par \par \uc2 At about 6-foot-2, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  would have a body mass index of 30.3. The National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute defines obesity as a B.M.I. of 30 or more, and overweight as 25 to 29.9.\par \par \uc2 NBC News reported that Dr. Oz pronounced Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  ''slightly overweight.''\par \par \uc2 Democrats have seized on Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's weight this week, with Harry Reid, the Senate minority leader, noting Tuesday that he was hardly ''slim and trim,'' and \uc2 David Plouffe\uc2 , a former senior adviser to President Obama, suggesting on \uc2 Twitter\uc2  that he would rival William Howard Taft in portliness.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  has yet to make public as much personal medical information as Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  has. Earlier this week, he said he would soon release new medical records, and he was expected to discuss the results of his physical on Dr. Oz's show. During the taping, he theatrically produced what he described as the results and allowed Dr. Oz to review them, according to the brief clip released.\par \par \uc2 Until this week, the latest medical information about Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  had come in December in a letter from his longtime physician, Dr. Harold Bornstein, which included a few numbers -- Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's blood pressure and PSA test score -- and little else aside from superlatives and boasts. The letter also said that Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  had lost 15 pounds over the previous year, though it did not give his weight before or after.\par \par \uc2 In the letter released by the \uc2 Clinton\uc2  campaign, Dr. Bardack said that she had examined Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , 68, on Friday for a prolonged, allergy-related cough, discovered ''small right middle-lobe pneumonia,'' put her on antibiotics and advised her ''to rest and modify her schedule.'' At the Sept. 11 ceremony, she said, Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  ''became overheated and dehydrated,'' but was ''rehydrated and recovering nicely'' later that day.\par \par \uc2 Criticized for concealing Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's illness, her aides apologized on Monday and promised to release more information about her medical history.\par \par \uc2 Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  canceled trips to California and Nevada this week to rest, but she planned to return to the campaign trail on Thursday.\par \par \uc2 Dr. Bardack's letter also cast some new light on the persistent cough that Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  complained of before she was found to have pneumonia. Dr. Bardack said she had examined Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  on Sept. 2, a week before the pneumonia diagnosis, after Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  experienced a low-grade fever, congestion and fatigue. She prescribed antibiotics and rest, but Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  continued to travel, and over several days, ''her congestion worsened and she developed a cough,'' Dr. Bardack wrote.\par \par \uc2 That Monday, Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  had an extended coughing attack while trying to deliver a Labor Day speech in Cleveland.\par \par \uc2 The details released Wednesday included that Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  has been taking the antibiotic Levaquin, ''as well as B-12 as needed.''\par \par \uc2 Dr. William Schaffner, a professor of infectious diseases at Vanderbilt University, said that the information suggested Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  may have had the pneumonia for a longer period, and that she needed a follow-up examination and X-rays to make sure it was responding well to the antibiotics.\par \par \uc2 Dr. Bardack wrote that ''the remainder of her complete physical exam was normal, and she is in excellent mental condition.'' Her letter did not include Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's height or weight.\par \par \uc2 It did note, however, that in January, Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  developed a sinus and ear infection that caused ''progressive pain in her left ear.'' She was treated with antibiotics as well as the placement of a myringotomy tube in her ear, and her symptoms resolved by March.\par \par \uc2 Before Sunday, Dr. Bardack's last public comment about Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's health had come in a two-page letter in July 2015 describing her as a ''healthy female with hypothyroidism and seasonal allergies'' who was in ''excellent physical condition.''\par \par \uc2 Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  has expressed frustration with what she says is a double standard, in which she is expected to adhere to traditional levels of transparency but Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  is not penalized for ignoring them. She has quickly shifted from questions about her medical records to criticizing Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  for not releasing his tax returns.\par \par \uc2 ''It's really past time for him to be held to the same standards,'' she told \uc2 CNN\uc2  on Monday night.\par \par \uc2 Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's running mate, Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia, also released a doctor's letter Wednesday, saying he was in excellent health and worked out three times a week. Dr. Brian Monahan, the attending physician to Congress, said Mr. Kaine's cholesterol and blood lipids were elevated, but made no mention of a statin drug. The upper chamber of the left side of Mr. Kaine's heart is enlarged, but Dr. Monahan noted nothing else unusual about his heart or major arteries.\par \par \uc2 Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's disclosures may help her campaign bat down rumors about her health that have been driven by conservative news outlets with Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's encouragement.\par \par \uc2 After her coughing fit in Cleveland, Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  casually told reporters on her campaign plane that she was taking more antihistamines. ''It happens like twice a year, in the spring when the pollen comes, and it happens in the fall,'' she said. ''It lasts a couple days, and then it disappears.''\par \par \uc2 ''There is a long video recording that someone is compiling right now, going back decades,'' she added jokingly.\par \par \uc2 Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  has tried to bounce back quickly from medical issues in the past. In 2009, she slipped in a State Department garage and fractured her elbow, but traveled to India and Thailand a few days later with her arm in a sling and her joint held together with wire and pins.\par \par \uc2 She took longer to recover after dehydration brought on by a stomach virus led her to faint and hit her head on a toilet at her home in 2012. She sustained a concussion and was later found to have a blood clot in her head. Among the events she missed was testifying before Congress about the Sept. 11, 2012, attack in Benghazi, Libya.\par \par \uc2 The timing led to widespread speculation by Republicans, who accused Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  of faking an illness. One Fox News contributor called it an ''acute Benghazi allergy.''\par \par \uc2 Some have expressed concern about a similar politicizing of Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's current diagnosis.\par \par \uc2 ''They're hitting each other on the heads with stethoscopes to try to earn points,'' said Arthur L. Caplan, a professor of medical ethics at New York University.\par \par \uc2 But Dr. Caplan said both candidates needed additional scrutiny, given their ages. ''You've got older candidates, so you're going to see health problems and risks detected in both of them,'' he said. ''Seventy is still the new 70.''\par \par \uc2 Find out what you need to know about the 2016 presidential race today, and get politics news updates via \uc2 Facebook\uc2 , \uc2 Twitter\uc2  and the First Draft newsletter.\par \par \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  at the National Baptist Convention in Kansas City, Mo., last Thursday.

\par\par \uc2 National Desk; SECTA\par \b \uc2 New Light on \uc2 Trump\uc2 's $25,000 Support of an Attorney General\b0\par\par\uc2 By KEVIN SACK and STEVE EDER; Kevin Sack reported from Tallahassee, and Steve Eder from New York. Kitty Bennett and Agustin Armendariz contributed research. \par \uc2 2,041 \uc2 words\par \uc2 15 September 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 1\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 TALLAHASSEE, Fla. -- It was Aug. 29, 2013, an unremarkable day inside Florida's whitewashed Capitol, and a typically sweltering one outside among the moss-bearded oaks and sabal palms. Around 3:45 p.m., \uc2 Jennifer Meale\uc2 , the communications director for Attorney General Pam Bondi, fielded a seemingly routine call from a financial reporter for The Orlando Sentinel. The attorney general of New York had recently filed a lawsuit against \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2  alleging fraud in the marketing of \uc2 Trump\uc2  University's real estate and wealth-building seminars. Had Florida ever conducted its own investigation, the reporter asked.\par \par \uc2 The call set off an exchange of emails between Ms. Meale and top lawyers in the office. She learned that 23 complaints about \uc2 Trump\uc2 -related education enterprises had been filed before Ms. Bondi became attorney general in 2011, and one since. They had never generated a formal investigation, she wrote the reporter, but added, ''We are currently reviewing the allegations in the New York complaint.''\par \par \uc2 The Sentinel's report, which was published on Sept. 13, 2013, paraphrased Ms. Meale's response and took it a step further, saying that Ms. Bondi's office would ''determine whether Florida should join the multi-state case.'' Four days later, a check for $25,000 from the Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2  Foundation landed in the Tampa office of a political action committee that had been formed to support Ms. Bondi's 2014 re-\uc2 election\uc2 . In mid-October, her office announced that it would not be acting on the \uc2 Trump\uc2  University complaints.\par \par \uc2 The proximate timing of the Sentinel article and Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's donation, and suspicions of a quid pro quo, have driven a narrative that has dogged Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  and Ms. Bondi for three years. It has intensified during Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's presidential campaign, peaking this month with the filing of ethics complaints, calls for a federal investigation by editorial boards and Democrats in Congress, and a new investigation of Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's foundation by New York regulators.\par \par \uc2 But documents obtained this week by The \uc2 New York Times\uc2 , including a copy of Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's check, at least partly undercut that timeline. Although the check was received by Ms. Bondi's committee four days after the Sentinel report, and was recorded as such in her financial disclosure filings, it was actually dated and signed by Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  four days before the article appeared.\par \par \uc2 The check's date does not categorically demonstrate that Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  was not seeking to influence Ms. Bondi, a fellow Republican. Even as he has denied trying to do so in this instance, he has boasted brazenly and repeatedly during his presidential campaign that he has made copious campaign contributions over the past two decades, including to \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  and other Democrats, in order to buy access and consideration for his business dealings.\par \par \uc2 Politicians in Florida, which Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  considers his second home, have been among his leading beneficiaries. An analysis of public records shows he has contributed at least $375,000 to state and federal candidates and political committees here since 1995, accounting for 19 percent of the roughly $2 million he has given to campaigns nationwide, other than his own.\par \par \uc2 Although not unprecedented, his $25,000 gift to And Justice for All, the committee supporting Ms. Bondi, is among his largest.\par \par \uc2 What is more, when Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  wrote that check, he still theoretically had reason to be concerned that Florida's attorney general could become a player in the legal assault on \uc2 Trump\uc2  University.\par \par \uc2 Through 2010, when the company ceased operations, Florida had been one of the most lucrative markets for his unaccredited for-profit school. It ranked second among states in purchases, with 950 transactions, and third in sales, at $3.3 million, according to an analysis of sales data revealed in court filings.\par \par \uc2 The lawsuit by New York's Democratic attorney general, Eric T. Schneiderman, which was announced on Aug. 25, 2013 -- two weeks before Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  wrote the check to And Justice for All on Sept. 9 -- did not cite allegations from consumers in Florida. But news organizations had reported as early as 2010 that the attorneys general of Florida and Texas had fielded complaints from consumers who had paid up to $35,000 for Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's seminars and mentoring programs. His contribution, therefore, could have been a pre-emptive investment to discourage Ms. Bondi from joining the New York case.\par \par \uc2 Brian Ballard, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's lobbyist in Florida, said it was ''ridiculous'' to think his client sought to buy off Ms. Bondi. ''I'm the \uc2 Trump\uc2  Organization\uc2  lobbyist, and he has never, ever brought up \uc2 Trump\uc2  University with me,'' he said. ''It wasn't something of concern to him. With \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2 , if a friend calls up and says, 'Listen, I'm running for XYZ, could you help me?' his instinct is to say yes. That's all it was.''\par \par \uc2 Yet, even those who doubt anything nefarious between Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  and Ms. Bondi acknowledge that they bear blame for the intensifying focus on the appearance of a conflict.\par \par \uc2 For his part, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  fanned the embers by sending the contribution from his nonprofit foundation, which cannot under federal law make political donations. When questions arose this year, he agreed to refund $25,000 to the foundation from his personal account and pay a $2,500 penalty to the \uc2 Internal Revenue Service\uc2 . \uc2 Trump\uc2  officials have called the mix-up an inadvertent error by his staff.\par \par \uc2 Ms. Bondi, meanwhile, has failed to explain why she accepted Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's check even after learning that her office was examining the New York case against \uc2 Trump\uc2  University. Six months later, she allowed him to host a $3,000-per-head fund-raiser for her at his Mar-a-Lago Club in Palm Beach. Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  attended the event, which records indicate raised at least $50,000.\par \par \uc2 Now, with the revelation of the date on Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's check -- which came in a release of correspondence by Mr. Schneiderman -- it appears that Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  and Ms. Bondi had in their possession a piece of favorable evidence that they bewilderingly failed to disclose.\par \par \uc2 ''All these things come together in a way that if you don't unpack the whole thing, the unspoken implications coalesce to create this great suspicion,'' said Mac Stipanovich, a longtime Florida Republican strategist and lobbyist who disdains Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  and has never worked with Ms. Bondi. ''The optics are terrible even though there is not a shred of evidence that Pam Bondi solicited a bribe or that \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  provided one.''\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  and Ms. Bondi have said they share a long friendship, but the origins of it are not apparent. Ms. Bondi, who declined requests for an interview, initially backed former Gov. Jeb Bush of Florida for president. After he withdrew from the race, she endorsed Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  the day before Florida's March 15 primary, snubbing the state's other favorite son, Senator \uc2 Marco Rubio\uc2 . The only woman currently holding statewide elected office in Florida, she has since become an enthusiastic \uc2 Trump\uc2  surrogate.\par \par \uc2 Ms. Bondi became a conservative darling in 2010 when, as an assistant state attorney, she won her post in her first campaign of any kind. Her political future is unclear as she faces a two-term limit and has said she will not run for governor in 2018.\par \par \uc2 It was in late summer 2013, as her re-\uc2 election\uc2  campaign was gearing up, that Ms. Bondi called Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  to solicit the donation, aides to both of them have said; they have declined to provide a precise date. Records show that Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  had already donated $500 to Ms. Bondi's campaign on July 15. His daughter \uc2 Ivanka \uc2 Trump\uc2  donated another $500 on Sept. 10.\par \par \uc2 The Texas attorney general's office, then under Greg Abbott, a Republican, had also decided in 2010 not to act on complaints against \uc2 Trump\uc2  University when it left the state. Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  later donated $35,000 to Mr. Abbott's successful 2014 campaign for governor. Mr. Abbott's office has denied there was any connection. No other attorneys general have joined Mr. Schneiderman's litigation.\par \par \uc2 Both Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  and Ms. Bondi have said they never discussed complaints against \uc2 Trump\uc2  University and a separate entity, \uc2 Trump\uc2  Institute, which Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  did not own but that paid him licensing fees to use his name for wealth seminars held in hotel ballrooms.\par \par \uc2 There is no evidence in more than 8,000 pages of documents released by Ms. Bondi's office in response to an open records request that she had any direct role in assessing a potential case against \uc2 Trump\uc2  University, or that she knew of the Florida complaints when she asked Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  for money.\par \par \uc2 That would not be unusual. Although most of the complaints were received before Ms. Bondi's \uc2 election\uc2 , her predecessor, Bill McCollum, said he had never heard about them. His two top deputies and the chief lawyer and investigator in his consumer protection division each said in interviews that the complaints never reached their level.\par \par \uc2 ''For whatever reason, the synergy didn't exist before I left office,'' said Mr. McCollum, who received a $500 donation from Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  in 2006.\par \par \uc2 Tens of thousands of consumer allegations are lodged with Florida's attorney general each year on everything from used-car sales to pharmaceutical marketing to price gouging. The consumer protection division currently has 38 lawyers and 37 investigators. Limits on manpower and resources mean that most complaints do not prompt a formal probe and therefore do not come to the attorney general's attention, former officials said.\par \par \uc2 Mr. McCollum's deputy, Robert Hannah, and his consumer protection chief, Mary Leontakianakos, said the triage process took into account the quantity, veracity and seriousness of the complaints, as well as the number of Floridians affected and the potential to collect damages. Mr. Hannah said that ''20 would not be the number of complaints that would cause someone to get concerned.''\par \par \uc2 The complaints against \uc2 Trump\uc2  University continued once Ms. Bondi took over, albeit at a slower pace because \uc2 Trump\uc2  University, as well as \uc2 Trump\uc2  Institute, based in Boca Raton, Fla., were no longer operating.\par \par \uc2 In April 2011, Elizabeth J. Starr, then the chief of consumer protection in the Orlando office, wrote in an internal email that she had ''light discussion'' about devoting additional resources to assessing the \uc2 Trump\uc2  complaints. ''The decision was made to hold off at that time,'' she wrote.\par \par \uc2 In the weeks after the initial September 2013 article in The Sentinel, Ms. Bondi received daily emails from her staff to her personal \uc2 Yahoo\uc2  address with news reports about the \uc2 Trump\uc2  case. By mid-October, \uc2 Scott Maxwell\uc2 , a columnist for The Sentinel, had spotted Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's $25,000 donation in public filings and wrote that it smelled ''awfully fishy.'' His column set off days of critical coverage.\par \par \uc2 Despite the pressure, Mark Hamilton, a lawyer in the consumer protection division who eventually had a discussion with an attorney prosecuting the New York case, pushed his view internally that already-announced litigation would cover any Floridians who had been harmed by \uc2 Trump\uc2  University. Within two days, The \uc2 Miami Herald\uc2  reported that Ms. Bondi's spokeswoman had said no action would be necessary because the affected Florida consumers would be compensated if Mr. Schneiderman won his lawsuit.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  also weighed in for the same article.\par \par \uc2 ''Pam Bondi is a fabulous representative of the people -- Florida is lucky to have her,'' he said in a statement. ''The case in New York is pure politics brought by an incompetent attorney general, a political hack.''\par \par \uc2 Find out what you need to know about the 2016 presidential race today, and get politics news updates via \uc2 Facebook\uc2 , \uc2 Twitter\uc2  and the First Draft newsletter.\par \par \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2  and Attorney General Pam Bondi of Florida in March at Mar-a-Lago in Palm Beach, Fla.

\par\par \uc2 Politics; SECT\par \b \uc2 Sales of \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's New Book Are Off to a Slow Start\b0\par\par\uc2 By AMY CHOZICK \par \uc2 621 \uc2 words\par \uc2 15 September 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 The New York Times on the Web\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's newest book, ''Stronger Together,'' which provides a policy blueprint for where she hopes to take the country if she is elected president, sold just 2,912 copies in its first week on sale, according to Nielsen BookScan.\par \par \uc2 Both Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  and her running mate, Senator Tim Kaine, have promoted the book on the campaign trail, but the sales figure, which tallies about 80 percent of booksellers nationwide and does not include e-books, firmly makes the book what the publishing industry would consider a flop.\par \par \uc2 First-week sales typically account for around a third of the total sold, thanks to the publicity blitzes that accompany publishers' biggest releases. By comparison, Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's 2014 memoir, ''Hard Choices,'' which also fell short of expectations, sold more than 85,000 copies in its first week.\par \par \uc2 Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's more revealing 2003 memoir, ''Living History,'' about her years in the White House, sold about six times as many copies in its first week as ''Hard Choices.''\par \par \uc2 Candidates often release hurriedly-written books during their campaigns, often aimed at spreading their message and attracting publicity, rather than topping the best-seller charts.\par \par \uc2 In 2006, Senator \uc2 Barack Obama\uc2  published ''The Audacity of Hope,'' which laid out his vision for the country. In February 2008, when Mr. Obama's campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination against Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  gained momentum, the book averaged sales of more than 35,000 a week.\par \par \uc2 Others cash in after an \uc2 election\uc2 . \uc2 Sarah Palin\uc2 's ''Going Rogue: An American Life'' sold 469,000 copies in its first week in November 2009.\par \par \uc2 ''Stronger Together,'' whose cover shows Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  and Mr. Kaine waving, arrived closer to \uc2 Election\uc2  Day than most of these types of books.\par \par \uc2 Named after the campaign's slogan, ''Stronger Together'' offers readers, according to the book jacket, ''specific and practical solutions, while also articulating a bold and expansive vision of change and renewal.''\par \par \uc2 Its roughly 250 pages intersperse bullet-point policy ideas, like ''launch a national initiative for suicide prevention'' and ''humanely address the Central American migrant crisis,'' with photographs of Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  and Mr. Kaine on the campaign trail, charts in the campaign's signature chunky font and highlights from Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's speeches.\par \par \uc2 Aides said that the proceeds were going to charity, and that the release was part of a larger plan to more clearly communicate Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's vision for the country, rather than just her case against \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , her Republican opponent.\par \par \uc2 Timed to the Sept. 6 release of the book, Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  ''will do a series of 'Stronger Together' speeches over the course of the next several weeks,'' a campaign spokesman, Jennifer Palmieri said. (A case of pneumonia caused Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  to postpone the first of those speeches, on an ''inclusive economy,'' initially scheduled for Tuesday in California.)\par \par \uc2 Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  and Mr. Kaine held the book up at campaign rallies last week.\par \par \uc2 At one point, Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  greeted reporters on her campaign plane holding a copy of the book. ''We're putting out a book tomorrow, called 'Stronger Together,' which is our blueprint for America's future,'' she explained. ''We wanted voters to be able to find, in one easy place, all of the various plans and policies that I've been talking about throughout this campaign.''\par \par \uc2 A spokesman for the publisher, Simon & Schuster, which also published Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's earlier books and \uc2 Bill \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's best-selling memoir, ''My Life,'' declined to comment about the first-week sales.\par \par \uc2 Find out what you need to know about the 2016 presidential race today, and get politics news updates via \uc2 Facebook\uc2 , \uc2 Twitter\uc2  and the First Draft newsletter.\par \par \uc2 Document NYTF000020160915ec9f00045\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 Foreign Desk; SECTA\par \b \uc2 China Expels 45 Legislators Over Fraud in \uc2 Election\b0\par\par\uc2 By MICHAEL FORSYTHE; Kiki Zhao and Owen Guo in Beijing contributed research. \par \uc2 850 \uc2 words\par \uc2 15 September 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 12\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 HONG KONG -- China's legislature has expelled 45 of its members in a vote-buying scandal that has snared a prominent businessman who is active in donating to American universities, foundations and political campaigns.\par \par \uc2 Some of the lawmakers whose dismissals were announced on Tuesday, all from the economically struggling northeastern province of Liaoning, had bribed their way into the National People's Congress by buying votes, according to the official news agency \uc2 Xinhua\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 The nearly 3,000 members of the congress, which meets as a full body for less than two weeks each March, ratify laws and government programs, usually with little drama. Members are mostly voted in by lower-ranking organizations, including provincial congresses.\par \par \uc2 The businessman, Wang Wenliang, is a billionaire who made his fortune in the construction business and from operating a strategic port on the North Korean border. Mr. Wang has also been linked with entities holding hidden stakes in three condominiums in the Time Warner Center in New York.\par \par \uc2 Through his companies, Mr. Wang has donated to American universities, charities, research institutes and political campaigns, including \uc2 New York University\uc2 , the \uc2 Clinton\uc2  Foundation\uc2  and the successful 2013 campaign for Virginia governor of \uc2 Terry McAuliffe\uc2 , a Democrat. Though Mr. Wang is a Chinese citizen, he is also a legal permanent resident of the United States, which entitles him to make campaign contributions.\par \par \uc2 A woman answering the phone at the China Rilin Construction Group, a company in Liaoning where Mr. Wang serves as chairman, said that he was on a business trip and unavailable to comment.\par \par \uc2 Sig Rogich, an adviser to Mr. Wang who is based in Las Vegas, said his client was a philanthropist, an environmentalist and ''a man of great integrity.''\par \par \uc2 Zhang Dejiang, the chairman of the National People's Congress, told lawmakers on Tuesday that the bribery scandal, which resulted in the expulsion of almost half of the province's delegation, was unprecedented in the history of the People's Republic of China, \uc2 Xinhua\uc2  reported. He vowed to show ''no mercy.''\par \par \uc2 Often derided as a rubber-stamp legislature, the congress and its companion advisory body have in recent years become a club for some of China's wealthiest executives, keen to rub elbows with government officials. Holding such high office also brings prestige and, much like peerage or knighthood in Britain, is seen as a marker of status in the Communist Party-dominated establishment. In China, it is sometimes known as ''wearing the red hat.''\par \par \uc2 ''People within the system can trade interests,'' Zhang Ming, a political scientist at Renmin University in Beijing, said by telephone. ''Whoever gets elected will have a pass to do so.''\par \par \uc2 Serving as a lawmaker has become so attractive to the wealthy that last year, of the 1,271 richest Chinese people tracked by the Shanghai-based Hurun Report, a record 203, or more than one in seven, were delegates to the National People's Congress or its advisory body. The richest person that year among all three branches of the United States government, Representative \uc2 Darrell Issa\uc2  of California, would only rank as the 166th richest if he were a Chinese lawmaker.\par \par \uc2 ''For reasons that don't make sense to outsiders given the 'rubber stamp' nature of the N.P.C., membership in any honorary body is coveted by people who see it as a mark of social status, something to add to their resumes,'' said Suzanne Pepper, a scholar based in Hong Kong who studies Chinese elections.\par \par \uc2 Many of the expelled delegates are executives of private businesses or leaders of state-owned companies, rather than career politicians and military officers -- who are also well represented on the body.\par \par \uc2 The vote-buying scandal in Liaoning has been brewing for at least five years, with hundreds of officials and lawmakers in its provincial bodies accused of engaging in the bribery, according to a report in Caixin, a well-regarded Chinese newsmagazine. The report, posted online on Tuesday, has since been taken off the internet.\par \par \uc2 In 2013, in the southern province of Hunan, 56 provincial lawmakers in one city had offered more 110 million renminbi, or $16.5 million, in vote-related bribes to lower-ranking officials there, \uc2 Xinhua\uc2  reported at the time.\par \par \uc2 Delegates to the National People's Congress are elected for five-year terms. The current term began in 2013.\par \par \uc2 News that China faced new accusations of \uc2 election\uc2  fraud has drawn some tart comments on social media from people who are not accustomed to what for some in other countries can be an all-consuming obsession with following electoral politics. Usually, Chinese audiences read about elections in other countries.\par \par \uc2 ''When I saw the news about the vote buying scandal in Liaoning, I was shocked,'' wrote one user on Weibo, a Chinese \uc2 Twitter\uc2 -like social media platform. ''I didn't know there were elections in the motherland!''\par \par \uc2 This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.\par \par \uc2 Follow Michael Forsythe on Twitter @PekingMike.\par \par \uc2 Document NYTF000020160915ec9f00044\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 Style Desk; SECT\par \b \uc2 Ivana \uc2 Trump\uc2  Supports Dennis Basso, and Her Ex-Husband\b0\par\par\uc2 By JACOB BERNSTEIN \par \uc2 638 \uc2 words\par \uc2 15 September 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 The New York Times on the Web\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Ivana \uc2 Trump\uc2 , best known as the first spouse of the 2016 Republican candidate for president and the woman who coined the term ''The Donald,'' made her New York Fashion Week spring 2017 debut at Dennis Basso on Tuesday, sitting front row at Moynihan Station on the West Side of Manhattan.\par \par \uc2 Ms. \uc2 Trump\uc2  wore a black-and-white patterned dress and sat next to Nikki Haskell, a West Coast socialite who helped invent the weight-loss pill Star Caps and who was profiled recently in \uc2 Politico\uc2  in an article called ''The Real Trumpettes of Bel Air.''\par \par \uc2 When the Trumps divorced in the early '90s, after Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's affair with Marla Maples (soon to be Wife No. 2), things were anything but cordial between them. But reporters hoping for a morsel of news that might somehow break the Twittersphere were going to walk away disappointed on this day.\par \par \uc2 Ms. \uc2 Trump\uc2  has already issued unequivocal support for her former husband. And as a reporter approached, she was busy telling someone else about her stance on immigration.\par \par \uc2 ''I think the Mexican people and all the immigrants are perfectly fine,'' she said. ''They are good workers and good people, but they have to come here legally, they have to speak at least a little bit of English and pay their taxes.''\par \par \uc2 She was also not so inclined to discuss such issues with anyone from The \uc2 New York Times\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 ''You are not so nice to Donald,'' Ms. \uc2 Trump\uc2  said, adding that she was ''not a politician'' and was here only because Mr. Basso was a ''good friend.''\par \par \uc2 Had he designed her dress, too?\par \par \uc2 ''No,'' she said. ''Roberto Cavalli.''\par \par \uc2 Security guards announced that the show was about to begin, and party page fixtures like Nicky Hilton Rothschild, Somers Farkas and Elisabeth Kieselstein-Cord took their seats.\par \par \uc2 Then, electronic music blared for 15 minutes, while models showed off white fitted cocktail dresses, taupe suede skirts and luscious brown bolero-like fur coats.\par \par \uc2 In the audience was Kelly Killoren Bensimon and Luann de Lesseps -- both of whom have appeared on ''The Real Housewives of New York'' over the years.\par \par \uc2 Ms. de Lesseps and Ms. Bensimon (who referred to the crowd as ''well bred, well fed and well read'') headed backstage afterward to kiss the ring of the man who designed the collection.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Basso was dressed in a black blazer, a black-and-white tie and khaki-ish dress pants. And it was quickly clear that he has a formidable ability to show equal love for all the women in attendance, whether young or old, famous or nonfamous.\par \par \uc2 He kissed random grandmothers and squeezed their wrists. He posed for pictures with the young daughters of his more middle-aged clients.\par \par \uc2 ''It's wonderful,'' he said, looking out at all his well-wishers a moment later. ''We have young women in their teens to women of a certain age. I think that's great.''\par \par \uc2 Of course, not every designer in this polarized \uc2 election\uc2  season would be so eager to have the supportive ex-wife of the Republican contestant for president as one of these front-row patrons, but Mr. Basso had no such quibbles.\par \par \uc2 ''She's a wonderful woman,'' he said of Ms. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , shortly after a quick hello with her, too. ''She was at my first show in 1983. And she's actually been to every show since then. Her children come. We're friends of the family.''\par \par \uc2 But he was not about to say whom he was planning on voting for.\par \par \uc2 ''I think that's a personal question,'' he said, darting off to kiss more cheeks and squeeze more wrists.\par \par \uc2 Continue following our fashion and lifestyle coverage on \uc2 Facebook\uc2  (Styles and Modern Love), \uc2 Twitter\uc2  (Styles, Fashion and Weddings) and \uc2 Instagram\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Document NYTF000020160915ec9f0003t\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 LETTERS\par \uc2 Editorial Desk; SECTA\par \b \uc2 Trump\uc2  and Kentucky's Downtrodden\b0\par\par\uc2 812 \uc2 words\par \uc2 15 September 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 26\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 To the Editor:\par \par \uc2 I read with interest Roger Cohen's column about the many Kentuckians supporting \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  (''We Need 'Someone Spectacular,' '' Sunday Review, Sept. 11).\par \par \uc2 I lived most of my life in Kentucky. My grandfather was a coal miner and saloonkeeper. My parents were a truck driver and a beautician. I worked on the oil field pipelines of western Kentucky and in a chemical plant. I have some idea of what ordinary working stiffs go through. It is not easy. Automation, foreign competition and shifts in types of energy have taken a toll.\par \par \uc2 Hard times are not an excuse for ignorance. I am now deeply ashamed of the citizens of Kentucky for promoting the absolute nothingness that is \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2 . A preening billionaire is going to create jobs out of thin air? A blustering reality show host is going to make America great? \uc2 Vladimir Putin\uc2  is our new pal?\par \par \uc2 The American experiment will face its greatest threat in November. It is very sad that my beloved Bluegrass State will probably vote against its own interests, again.\par \par \uc2 DAVID DOGGETT\par \par \uc2 Silver Spring, Md.\par \par \uc2 To the Editor:\par \par \uc2 Roger Cohen's column about Appalachia's embrace of \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  was as disturbing as it was sad. More than one of the people interviewed agreed that Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  was dangerous -- as one man put it, he's probably ''going to get us killed'' -- without hesitating to support him for president. Despondent individuals have been known to provoke ''suicide by cop.'' But ''suicide by politician''? That's new.\par \par \uc2 Many in this country, having lost their jobs and sense of purpose, feel that they have nothing else to lose. Given the hardships in their lives, they're entitled to express anger, frustration and despair.\par \par \uc2 But when they vote to empower the dangerous Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , they won't just be putting their own lives at stake. Suicide by politician means the rest of us get taken out, too.\par \par \uc2 GAYE BROWN\par \par \uc2 Portland, Me.\par \par \uc2 To the Editor:\par \par \uc2 In the midst of a report about the economic problems in Kentucky coal country, Roger Cohen comes up with the incredible remark that \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  can win the \uc2 election\uc2  ''in part because of the liberal intellectual arrogance that dismisses the economic, social and cultural problems his rise has underscored.''\par \par \uc2 As a liberal, I consider this remark offensive and totally disconnected from reality. It is the Obama administration that has been pushing for infrastructure spending for years against Republican resistance in Congress. It is the Obama administration that rescued the auto industry and saved millions of jobs, also against Republican opposition.\par \par \uc2 It is Republicans who have undercut and threaten to destroy Obamacare, the program that low-income and unemployed people, like Kentucky coal miners, can turn to when employer-sponsored health care disappears. It is what is known as the political left that is pushing for alternate energy industries that could provide new jobs to replace lost coal jobs. And so on, and on.\par \par \uc2 JACK HERSCHLAG\par \par \uc2 Woodland Park, N.J.\par \par \uc2 To the Editor:\par \par \uc2 I am tired of seeing articles about why people like \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  and why people supposedly don't like \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 . Writing about Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , even in the guise of trying to explain him and his supporters, gives him traction. The more we are told that Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  is popular and the more his supporters are put in the limelight, the more people on the fence will be swayed to think there might be a choice in this \uc2 election\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Why go around looking for people who aren't wild about Hillary and trumpeting their voices? How about some frequent, front-page and in-depth coverage about all the people who are working hard to elect Hillary; those who think she is terrific; those who want a strong, determined, informed, smart and hardworking person as our next president?\par \par \uc2 There are millions of us out here; give us a voice. Give Hillary a fair shot.\par \par \uc2 KATHLEEN LEARNED\par \par \uc2 Seattle\par \par \uc2 To the Editor:\par \par \uc2 After reading Roger Cohen's column about \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2 's appeal in coal country, my reaction was: What makes them think they're special? Since 2014, almost 200,000 Americans have lost their oil industry jobs. \uc2 Dell\uc2 , \uc2 Cisco\uc2 , \uc2 IBM\uc2  and other tech giants have each laid off thousands; one Wall Street analyst says more than 350,000 tech industry jobs could be lost this year alone. Even \uc2 Walmart\uc2  announced 16,000 job cuts.\par \par \uc2 I cannot think of any job that hasn't changed dramatically or been eliminated in the last 20 years, including my own. Somehow a certain portion of underemployed Americans blame President Obama and think \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  can fix their lives. Perhaps if close to 40 percent of newspaper journalists hadn't also lost their jobs in the last decade, we might have a more realistic, better informed public.\par \par \uc2 SHEILA SORVARI\par \par \uc2 Austin, Tex.\par \par \uc2 Document NYTF000020160915ec9f0003b\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw272\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4080\pichgoal600

\par\par \b \uc2 Election\uc2  2016: GOP Tensions Could Grow --- With centrists at risk in \uc2 election\uc2 , conservatives stand to gain more influence in the House\b0\par\par\uc2 By Kristina Peterson   \par \uc2 645 \uc2 words\par \uc2 15 September 2016\par \uc2 The Wall Street Journal\par \uc2 J\par A6\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 Republicans are unlikely to lose their House majority in November's \uc2 election\uc2 , but party leaders could be left with a majority that is harder to control.\par \par \uc2 House Speaker \uc2 Paul Ryan\uc2  (R., Wis.), already contending with a band of dozens of strong-willed conservatives, could see that bloc's share of the House GOP grow next year, adding a new hurdle to any ambitious legislative efforts in 2017.\par \par \uc2 The reason: The Republicans imperiled by potential down-ballot whiplash against their presidential nominee, \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2 , are the dwindling handful of more centrist GOP lawmakers left in swing districts. If a Democratic wave sweeps through House elections in November -- or even a more modest current -- conservative lawmakers in safely Republican districts are most likely to survive.\par \par \uc2 Already often fractured over spending bills and other must-pass legislation, Republicans said their internal divisions could intensify if their majority shrinks and they lose many of their most centrist colleagues.\par \par \uc2 "If we lose a bunch of seats then it gets really, really hard," said Rep. Steve Stivers (R., Ohio). If Republicans only lose a net of 10 seats to 15 seats, he said, "it may be more manageable."\par \par \uc2 However many House seats Republicans lose, the GOP majority is expected to narrow. In the 2014 midterms, Republicans won 247 seats, their largest majority since 1928. That leaves the party defending many of the most competitive districts that tend to bounce between the two parties.\par \par \uc2 The GOP lawmakers most vulnerable in November are also those most willing to cross the aisle on policy. Reps. Bob Dold of Illinois and Carlos Curbelo of Florida have supported some new curbs on gun sales, while Rep. Mike Coffman of Colorado has broken with his party on some immigration proposals.\par \par \uc2 "That's one of the unfortunate things: the most vulnerable members are often the ones that are most constructive," said Rep. John Delaney (D., Md.).\par \par \uc2 Democratic leaders may stand to benefit if Mr. Ryan loses some of the Republicans on whom GOP leaders count to vote for bills opposed by many among the party faithful. Republican leaders already often lose 40 or more GOP votes on contentious legislation including must-pass spending bills, giving leverage to Democrats, whose votes are needed for the bills to pass. Conservatives say they are sticking to their principles and that a GOP-controlled Congress should make fewer concessions to Democrats.\par \par \uc2 The bloc of conservatives is already "big enough now that it has consequences that Paul [Ryan] has to consider with everything that we do," said Rep. Tom Rooney (R., Fla.). If, in November, "we lose seats, then they're going to have even more juice to dictate things that they want."\par \par \uc2 This week members of the Freedom Caucus, a bloc of the House's most conservative Republicans, pushed the House to vote on whether to impeach Internal Revenue Service Commissioner \uc2 John Koskinen\uc2 . However, late Wednesday night it appeared they would hold off in favor of an impeachment hearing next week instead.\par \par \uc2 Conservatives, who helped oust former House Speaker \uc2 John Boehner\uc2 , know they have some leverage in the \uc2 election\uc2  of the House speaker. If Mr. Ryan angers them in the lame-duck session between the \uc2 election\uc2  and January, some conservatives warned they may not initially support him as speaker.\par \par \uc2 "The focus for Speaker Ryan over the next 56 days is defending and strengthening our House majority," Kevin Seifert, executive director of Mr. Ryan's political office, said in a statement Tuesday.\par \par \uc2 Republicans noted that the \uc2 election\uc2  won't be a one-way exodus of centrist Republicans. Some conservatives are leaving at the end of this year and are likely to be replaced by Republicans expected to cooperate with GOP leaders.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=wjco20160915000096"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document J000000020160915ec9f0005f\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw272\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4080\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 Hacked emails posted on a website with suspected ties to Russian intelligence services show former Secretary of State \uc2 Colin Powell\uc2  harshly criticizing both \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  and \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 In one email, Mr. Powell said he remained on the sidelines while Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  marched toward the Republican presidential nomination because "to go on and call him an idiot just emboldens him." In another, Mr. Powell called Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  a "national disgrace and an international pariah."\par \par \uc2 The retired four-star general in one exchange called a Republican-led congressional investigation into the 2012 attacks in Benghazi, Libya, a "witch hunt." He also described a "tantrum" he threw at a party over Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's attempts to justify her use of a private email server by citing his email practices.\par \par \uc2 A spokeswoman for Mr. Powell, who served as secretary of state under President George W. Bush, confirmed the emails were authentic but declined to comment further.\par \par \uc2 The messages were posted Tuesday evening on DC Leaks, which some cybersecurity experts believe has ties to Russian intelligence services. It didn't explain how it obtained them.\par \par \uc2 In a 2014 email to Democratic donor Jeffrey Leeds, Mr. Powell described his misgivings about Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's presidential ambitions.\par \par \uc2 "I would rather not have to vote for her, although she is a friend I respect," Mr. Powell wrote, before describing her as having "unbridled ambition, greedy, not transformational."\par \par \uc2 "Everything [she] touches she kind of screws up with hubris," Mr. Powell wrote in another email to Mr. Leeds in 2015.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Powell expressed frustration with Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's use of a private email server while running the State Department.\par \par \uc2 Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's "mishandling of this has really given her a major problem I do not wish to get involved in, despite the best efforts of her team to drag me in," he wrote.\par \par \uc2 Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  "could have killed this two years ago by merely telling everyone honestly what she had done and not tie me into it. I told her staff three times not to try that gambit. I had to throw a mini tantrum at a Hampton's party to get their attention," he wrote in another email in 2016.\par \par \uc2 Correspondence between the two released last week by the House of Representatives showed Mr. Powell in 2009 describing to her the ways he used a private email setup out of concern about public-records laws. Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's team has pointed to that fact in defense of her email practice.\par \par \uc2 In another message, Mr. Powell said that Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  was responsible for a "racist" effort to show that President \uc2 Barack Obama\uc2  wasn't born in the U.S. Mr. Obama was born in Hawaii to an American mother and a Kenyan father, but a popular conspiracy theory stoked in part by Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  asserted he was born abroad and could be ineligible for the presidency.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  "can never overcome what he tried to do to Obama with his search for the birth certificate . . . the whole birther movement was racist," Mr. Powell wrote.\par \par \uc2 Representatives for Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  and the \uc2 Clinton\uc2  campaign didn't respond to requests for comment.\par \par \uc2 ---\par \par \uc2 Damian Paletta contributed to this article.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=wjco20160915000094"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document J000000020160915ec9f0005d\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw272\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4080\pichgoal600

\par\par \b \uc2 Clinton\uc2  Releases Update as Health Swings Into Focus\b0\par\par\uc2 By Peter Nicholas and Michael C. Bender   \par \uc2 991 \uc2 words\par \uc2 15 September 2016\par \uc2 The Wall Street Journal\par \uc2 J\par A1\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's campaign on Wednesday released additional medical information about the Democratic presidential nominee, as the health and fitness of the two major-party candidates remained a central focus of the race.\par \par \uc2 A two-page note by Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's doctor aimed to reassure voters she is in good overall health coming off a pneumonia diagnosis and a near-collapse over the weekend while she was getting into her vehicle. In the letter, her physician pronounced her healthy and "fit to serve as president."\par \par \uc2 Under pressure to reveal more about his health, \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2 's campaign initially said it would publicly release more medical details. Instead, the Republican nominee on Wednesday provided a written summary of a recent physical exam to TV doctor Mehmet Oz during a taping of his show, which is to air on Thursday.\par \par \uc2 At a rally Wednesday evening, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  mocked Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's recent health woes, suggesting she lacked his ability to endure giving a speech in a hot auditorium. "I don't know, folks, do you think Hillary would be able to stand up here for an hour and do this? I don't think so," he said to a crowd in Canton, Ohio.\par \par \uc2 After three days recuperating at home in Chappaqua, N.Y., Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  will return to the campaign trail Thursday with an appearance in North Carolina. She is facing one of the most severe tests of the campaign, with polls showing her losing ground nationally and in key battleground states. Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  and his running mate, Indiana Gov. Mike Pence, will meet with the Economic Club of New York on Thursday and will later hold an event in New Hampshire.\par \par \uc2 Age is one reason health has emerged as a campaign issue likely to play out through \uc2 Election\uc2  Day. Beginning with \uc2 Bill \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's \uc2 election\uc2  in 1992, the past three presidents were first elected in their 40s or 50s.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  is 70 years old, and if he prevails he would be the oldest newly elected president, eclipsing Ronald Reagan, who was 69 when he took the oath of office in 1981. Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , who turns 69 next month, would be the second-oldest.\par \par \uc2 "They're among the oldest to run for president," said Lawrence Altman, a physician who has written extensively about the health of U.S. presidents. "That's all the more reason the public needs to know as much as it can about the health of the candidates, and have reasonable assurance that the person can fulfill the full term."\par \par \uc2 While conservative critics have drawn attention to a prolonged cough that occasionally interrupted Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's speaking appearances, the stakes rose appreciably for the Democrat when amateur video posted to social media showed her nearly collapsing Sunday after abruptly leaving a 9/11 memorial ceremony in New York. About 90 minutes after she left the event, her campaign put out a statement saying she felt "overheated." Hours later, campaign aides said she had been diagnosed with pneumonia two days earlier.\par \par \uc2 The information released Wednesday offered more details about her condition.\par \par \uc2 Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's physician, Lisa Bardack, said that after several evaluations in recent days the former secretary of state is recovering well with antibiotics and rest. She said a chest CT scan on Friday revealed that Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  had a mild, noncontagious bacterial pneumonia.\par \par \uc2 In the letter released by the campaign, Dr. Bardack also described lab-test results that were normal, including cholesterol, heart rate and respiratory rate.\par \par \uc2 The medications Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  takes include the blood thinner Coumadin and the antihistamine Clarinex, the doctor said. Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  has experienced deep vein thrombosis, and previously had disclosed she takes such blood thinners to prevent blood clots. She also had an elbow fracture in 2009 and fainted and had a concussion in late 2012, which were discussed in a note from Dr. Bardack last year.\par \par \uc2 Dr. Bardack said Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's blood levels have been relatively stable and that the former secretary of state has had several allergy flares during the past year.\par \par \uc2 To combat the pneumonia, Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  is taking Levaquin for 10 days.\par \par \uc2 Dr. Bardack concluded that, beyond the recent diagnosis and a past sinus and ear infection, the Democratic nominee has "remained healthy and has not developed new medical conditions this year."\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 Clinton\uc2  campaign also released a one-page doctor's letter attesting to the health of running mate Tim Kaine, saying the Virginia senator is "in overall excellent health."\par \par \uc2 Until his appearance on the Dr. Oz Show, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  had released only a letter from his longtime doctor that offered scant details and ample superlatives, describing his health as "extraordinary." That physician, Harold Bornstein, also performed the physical examination that was discussed on Wednesday's show, according to a release by the show.\par \par \uc2 In a clip of the appearance released Wednesday, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  turned the moment into a bit of theater, asking the TV audience if he should publicly release more health information. "Should I do it? I have no problem," he said, pulling several pieces of paper from a pocket inside his navy-blue suit.\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 Trump\uc2  campaign didn't release the report he gave to Dr. Oz. Audience members interviewed afterward by cable-television news shows said the GOP nominee conceded he doesn't get much exercise and could lose a few pounds.\par \par \uc2 "\uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  said that he makes a lot of speeches, and that his hand gesturing is the main source of his exercise," Daniel Sinasohn, an audience member, said on MSNBC. "That's how he exercises."\par \par \uc2 Many presidents have endured illness and infirmity while in office. Democrat Franklin Roosevelt died in office in 1945. Republican Dwight Eisenhower suffered a heart attack. Mr. Reagan underwent cancer surgery.\par \par \uc2 ---\par \par \uc2 Rebecca Ballhaus, Colleen McCain Nelson and Thomas M.

"Everything she touched didn't work out. Nothing. Now \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  -- "\par \par \uc2 At that point, the church's pastor, Faith Green Timmons, interrupted and said, "I invited you here . . . not to give a political speech."\par \par \uc2 "Oh, OK, that's good," he said, and shifted his focus back to Flint. "OK. Flint's pain is a result of so many different failures."\par \par \uc2 His political comments were cut off just a few days after Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  gave a speech to a conference of evangelical conservatives, where he promised as president to repeal a law known as the Johnson amendment that bans pastors from endorsing candidates from the pulpit.\par \par \uc2 -- Janet Hook\par \par \uc2 ---\par \par \uc2 CLINTON\uc2  FOUNDATION\par \par \uc2 Program Sets Plans\par \par \uc2 To Cut Family Ties\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 Clinton\uc2  Health Access Initiative, the largest project of the \uc2 Clinton\uc2  Foundation\uc2 , announced Wednesday the steps it would take to sever ties to Democratic nominee \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  and her family if she is elected president.\par \par \uc2 Among CHAI's proposed changes, according to a spokeswoman: The five board members appointed by the \uc2 Clinton\uc2  Foundation\uc2  would step down, including former President \uc2 Bill \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , daughter \uc2 Chelsea \uc2 Clinton\uc2  and \uc2 Clinton\uc2  Foundation board chairman Bruce Lindsey.\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 Clinton\uc2  Foundation\uc2  would lose its power to appoint members of the board, and CHAI would no longer include "\uc2 Clinton\uc2 " in its name, though it would continue to go by the same acronym.\par \par \uc2 Meanwhile, the initiative doesn't plan to implement any restrictions on where it can raise money, as its parent foundation has done. The initiative relies heavily on government donations to fund public health, HIV/AIDS care, vaccination, antimalarial and other programs.\par \par \uc2 "CHAI is a global organization that works around the world, and as such, we have always accepted foreign donations and we would continue to do so to carry out our lifesaving work," said CHAI spokeswoman Regan Lachapelle.\par \par \uc2 The series of proposed changes mark a more substantial effort to distance CHAI from the \uc2 Clinton\uc2  family than those offered by its parent organization, the \uc2 Clinton\uc2  Foundation\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 -- Rebecca Ballhaus\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=wjco20160915000090"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document J000000020160915ec9f00059\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw272\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4080\pichgoal600

\par\par \b \uc2 Election\uc2  2016: Third-Party Ticket on Every Ballot for First Time in 20 Years\b0\par\par\uc2 By Byron Tau   \par \uc2 317 \uc2 words\par \uc2 15 September 2016\par \uc2 The Wall Street Journal\par \uc2 J\par A4\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 Libertarian presidential candidate \uc2 Gary Johnson\uc2 's campaign said Tuesday that he will be on the ballot in all 50 states plus the District of Columbia, marking the first time in two decades that a third-party presidential ticket has appeared on every state ballot.\par \par \uc2 "With a majority of Americans wanting a choice other than \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  and \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , today we now know for certain that on \uc2 Election\uc2  Day, every voter in America will have that alternative option," Mr. Johnson said.\par \par \uc2 No third-party presidential ticket has qualified for every ballot since 1996, when Libertarian Harry Browne and Reform Party candidate \uc2 Ross Perot\uc2  were on every state ballot. Mr. Browne nearly achieved universal ballot access again in 2000, but was stymied by an intraparty dispute where the Arizona Libertarian Party put a different candidate on the state's ballot.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Johnson, a former two-term Republican governor of New Mexico, is running with former Massachusetts Gov. Bill Weld as his running mate.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Johnson's presence on the ballot nationwide comes as voters have increasingly shown a deep level of dissatisfaction with Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  and Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , the two major-party nominees. In recent \uc2 election\uc2  cycles, third parties such as the Libertarians and the Green Party have been little more than an afterthought. However, recent polls show third-party candidates drawing double-digit support in many polls.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Johnson's campaign also said it was taking out a full-page ad in the \uc2 New York Times\uc2 , encouraging the commission that organizes the presidential debates to allow him access to the stage. He would need 15% of the vote in five marquee polls to qualify. He is more than five points shy of meeting that threshold, according to a recent calculation by \uc2 Politico\uc2 .\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=wjco20160915000087"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document J000000020160915ec9f00056\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw272\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4080\pichgoal600

\par\par \b \uc2 Election\uc2  2016: GOP Slow to Back \uc2 Trump\uc2  Leave Plan\b0\par\par\uc2 By Richard Rubin   \par \uc2 684 \uc2 words\par \uc2 15 September 2016\par \uc2 The Wall Street Journal\par \uc2 J\par A4\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2 's proposal to create a new federal program offering six weeks of partially paid maternity leave is winning few Republican supporters in Congress.\par \par \uc2 The mixed reaction to Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's proposal, put forward in a speech Tuesday, leaves him squeezed between Democrats who dismiss it as insufficient and Republicans reluctant to embrace ideas they have spent years criticizing.\par \par \uc2 If more Republicans sign on, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's plan could turn the paid-leave debate from a partisan standoff over whether to create a new benefit into a discussion over how generous it should be and how it should be paid for.\par \par \uc2 For now, there is significant wariness within the party. House Speaker \uc2 Paul Ryan\uc2  (R., Wis.), as well as two members of Congress who attended Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's speech, don't support a federal paid-leave plan.\par \par \uc2 A spokesman for one of them, Rep. Diane Black (R., Tenn.), said she supports only Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's tax cuts for child care. She "wants to see more businesses adopt paid-leave policies, but she does not support mandates to this effect at the federal level," said spokesman Jonathan Frank.\par \par \uc2 Sen. Orrin Hatch (R., Utah), chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, said he supports federally provided maternity leave, though he was concerned about the cost.\par \par \uc2 "Women are increasingly becoming workers," Mr. Hatch said. "And it's very unfair when they have families, and especially when we don't have an economy that's doing as good as we would like."\par \par \uc2 The U.S. is the only major country that doesn't provide paid leave for workers. Changing that has been a consistent cause for many Democrats, including presidential candidate \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 . In the 1990s, her husband, former President \uc2 Bill \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , signed a law requiring many employers to offer 12 weeks of unpaid leave.\par \par \uc2 Republicans have resisted federally guaranteed paid leave, warning against creating new entitlement programs, higher taxes or mandates for businesses. Instead, they have proposed tax incentives to businesses and plans to let workers accumulate leave instead of overtime pay.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , who was urged to make the shift by his daughter Ivanka, broke that mold as he tries to woo suburban and female voters.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's plan would expand unemployment benefits to include six weeks of maternity leave for workers who aren't covered by employers. Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's company released a statement saying it offers eight weeks of paid leave, but wouldn't say how long that policy has been in effect.\par \par \uc2 The campaign estimates the plan would cost $2.5 billion a year, which it says would be financed by eliminating waste and fraud in unemployment insurance. That's less than 10% of Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's more expansive plan, which would guarantee 12 weeks of coverage, at a higher pay rate, for a broader range of reasons.\par \par \uc2 "I'm just so delighted to have a Republican talking about maternity leave, because it finally puts Republicans in the debate," said Rep. Cynthia Lummis (R., Wyo.), who backs Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's tax proposals but said she wants to study paid leave further.\par \par \uc2 The rest of Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's child-care plan is a collection of tax cuts, including tax-advantaged savings accounts, a deduction for child-care costs and a rebate for low-income households. Because it relies on deductions that are more valuable to higher-income households, the plan provides bigger benefits to the upper middle class than to lower-income households.\par \par \uc2 Democrats criticized Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's proposal as tilted to high-income households. They also say his plan doesn't replace enough income, fails to address leaves for illnesses and caring for elderly parents, robs from unemployment benefits and is sexist because it focuses only on mothers.\par \par \uc2 Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  has a better plan and will actually work to turn it into law, said Marc Brumer, a spokesman for Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D., N.Y.), author of a bill to create a national paid-leave program.\par \par \uc2 ---\par \par \uc2 Mike Bender contributed to this article.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=wjco20160915000086"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document J000000020160915ec9f00055\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw272\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4080\pichgoal600

\par\par \b \uc2 Election\uc2  2016: Many Swing States Lag in Income Gains --- Census figures point to a weak recovery in rural and suburban areas of the country\b0\par\par\uc2 By Janet Adamy and Paul Overberg   \par \uc2 754 \uc2 words\par \uc2 15 September 2016\par \uc2 The Wall Street Journal\par \uc2 J\par A4\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 Key swing states such as Nevada, North Carolina and Florida have seen some of the weakest income growth in the country since the last nonincumbent presidential contest in 2008, new census figures show.\par \par \uc2 A Wall Street Journal analysis of state-by-state income data set for release Thursday shows that more than half of the 13 states where the presidential race appears closely contested have seen below-average income growth since 2008. Among the eight laggards, three states saw the lowest wage growth during that time -- Nevada, Georgia and Arizona.\par \par \uc2 The new data show how America's uneven economic recovery is adding another layer of unpredictability to an already volatile electoral map. The traditional realm of battleground states has expanded, putting into play states such as Arizona and Georgia, which haven't gone to a Democratic presidential candidate in at least 20 years.\par \par \uc2 The Census Bureau also said income inequality across the country increased in 2015. The recovery's income gains have been concentrated in central cities, with suburbs and rural areas largely lagging behind.\par \par \uc2 "You actually see the bottom and the top pulling apart a little bit more in some of these keys states," said David Damore, professor of political science at the University of Nevada Las Vegas.\par \par \uc2 On a national basis, most states still haven't seen income recover to prerecession levels. Americans' median household income in 2015 was 2.6% lower than in 2008, census figures show. A separate set of census figures this week showed the income picture brightened considerably in 2015, with the typical family seeing its first significant raise since 2007.\par \par \uc2 In Nevada, the median household income plunged 15.5% between 2008 and 2015 to $52,431 when adjusted for inflation, census figures show. The higher-paying construction jobs that were wiped out during the recession have been replaced by lower-paying service jobs, and the state has yet to recover from its housing collapse.\par \par \uc2 The nonincumbent party typically benefits most from economic unease. But the unorthodox candidacy of Republican presidential nominee \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  may change that dynamic, some political scientists say. Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  appears to be faring worse than previous GOP nominees in Arizona and Georgia, despite the weak income gains there.\par \par \uc2 "Voters always say the economy's the most important issue, but I don't think this \uc2 election\uc2  is about issues," said Peter Brown, assistant director of the Quinnipiac University Poll. "It's about two people, both of whom are enormously disliked."\par \par \uc2 Polls showing a surprisingly tight presidential race in Georgia and Arizona may have more to do with the influx of Latinos and other minorities in those states than any economic factors, Mr. Damore said.\par \par \uc2 In North Carolina, one of the most closely divided swing states this year, the median household income has fallen 6.7% since 2008 to $47,830 for 2015. Massive job losses in banking in Charlotte and at furniture makers in rural parts of the state haven't been fully offset by a crop of new technology and financial-services jobs concentrated in metropolitan areas. Its income growth was the sixth-lowest of any state and the District of Columbia since 2008.\par \par \uc2 In Florida, which has also recovered slowly from its housing collapse, median household income fell 6% between 2008 and 2015 to $49,426.\par \par \uc2 Colorado and Iowa are the only two battlegrounds where incomes showed notably above-average income gains. Median household income in Colorado rose 1.9% to $63,909 between 2008 and 2015 as the state benefited from a Western energy boom, among other things.\par \par \uc2 Urban areas have seen incomes hold up better than rural areas since the recession, with urban median household incomes decreasing 1.7% between 2008 and 2015, while such rural incomes fell 6.1%. But there are signs that pattern may be changing, as urban incomes rose 3.7% in 2015, while rural incomes rose 3.9%.\par \par \uc2 What is notable is that income growth in metropolitan suburban America continues to lag behind that of central cities. Highly educated millennials have flocked to downtowns in search of walkable lifestyles and entertainment.\par \par \uc2 "It's possible that the American dream of the suburbs has eroded," said Linda Lobao, professor of rural sociology at Ohio State University. "It's difficult to get to work, infrastructure hasn't been kept up."\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=wjco20160915000084"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document J000000020160915ec9f00053\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw272\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4080\pichgoal600

\par\par \b \uc2 What's a Reagan Internationalist to Do?\b0\par\par\uc2 By Robert G. Kaufman   \par \uc2 850 \uc2 words\par \uc2 15 September 2016\par \uc2 The Wall Street Journal\par \uc2 J\par A15\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 The \uc2 election\uc2  of 2016 offers a dismal choice for internationalist foreign-policy conservatives in the Reagan tradition.\par \par \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  has repudiated the main staples of Reagan's moral democratic realism, routinely disdaining the value of alliances with fellow democracies such as \uc2 NATO\uc2 , Japan, South Korea and India; advocating conciliation rather than firmness toward an increasingly authoritarian and expansionist \uc2 Vladimir Putin\uc2 ; and ignoring the gathering military danger of a Chinese tyranny's military buildup aimed at dominating East Asia, the world's most important geopolitical region for the 21st century.\par \par \uc2 Yet the internationalist conservatives who endorse \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  delude themselves if they think things would be better with a President \uc2 Clinton\uc2 . As secretary of state, Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  served loyally as President Obama's first mate on his foreign-policy Titanic. And unlike Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  has an actual record of mistakes and bad judgment in foreign policy.\par \par \uc2 Consider:\par \par \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  named the ill-fated reset with Mr. Putin, subverting Ukraine's independence and imperiling America's Eastern European NATO allies fearful of becoming Mr. Putin's next target. She also blocked efforts to place the murderous \uc2 Boko Haram\uc2  on the State Department's list of international sponsors of terrorism, fostering the Obama administration's fictitious narrative that killing Osama bin Laden had ended the war on terror.\par \par \uc2 Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  -- emblematic of the administration's unwillingness to acknowledge radical Islam as a danger -- blamed the attack on the Libyan Embassy on a Coptic Christian video denigrating Islam rather than on the obvious culprits and their Islamist motivations timed for the anniversary of 9/11. She fatuously called Syria's \uc2 Bashar Assad\uc2  a reformer with whom we could do business, and she touted the absurd notion that American "smart power" could substitute for American resolve, moral clarity and military might.\par \par \uc2 Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  remained silent, too, on President Obama's systematic, unwise and dishonorable obsession with putting distance between the U.S. and a democratic Israel while conciliating the worst and most anti-American regimes in international politics. Candidate \uc2 Clinton\uc2  still defends an indefensible Iran deal she advocated as secretary of state that puts Iran on the autobahn to crossing the nuclear threshold while tranquilizing Americans to the gathering danger.\par \par \uc2 Her choice of running mate, Tim Kaine, has the dubious distinction of being in the vanguard of the apologists for an untenable agreement subsidizing a virulently aggressive anti-American Iran while likely triggering a nuclear arms race in the world's most volatile region.\par \par \uc2 Even after the June terrorist attack in Orlando, Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  could barely utter the words Islamic radicalism, intimating that the weapons rather than the motivations of those wielding them deserved primary blame. That's the equivalent of blaming Pearl Harbor on military aviation rather than the Imperial Japanese regime.\par \par \uc2 As secretary of state, Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  bears heavy responsibility for the debacle in Libya. She was the administration's leading proponent for American intervention under the auspices of the United Nations, \uc2 NATO\uc2  and the Arab League, bypassing the Congress. Libya has become a breeding ground of Islamist terrorism because America's mission was ill-defined and its withdrawal premature.\par \par \uc2 Nor did Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  resign on principle when Mr. Obama prematurely withdrew from Iraq, failing to negotiate a status of forces agreement that would have retained a sizable American presence -- something the president could have achieved had he wanted it. On the contrary, Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  voiced no public objection to Mr. Obama's catastrophic decision precipitating Iraq's collapse, with ISIS and a revolutionary Iran filling the vacuum.\par \par \uc2 Nor, despite her allegedly private misgivings, did Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  resign on principle or object publicly to Mr. Obama's bungling and vacillating policy toward a Syrian civil war that has metastasized into a murderous, regional and sectarian civil war and a humanitarian refugee crisis wreaking havoc not just the region but also in Europe and the U.S.\par \par \uc2 The pivot to Asia that then-Secretary of State \uc2 Clinton\uc2  unveiled in 2011 has also proved hollow. Like Mr. Obama, Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  has de-emphasized the gathering danger of China's swelling ambitions, defined combating climate change as the priority, and emphasized diplomacy rather than American hard power. The combination of China's military buildup and America's precipitous build-down that Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  backed has increased the apprehension of traditional democratic allies in East Asia as well as India.\par \par \uc2 A vote for \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  is therefore a vote for Mr. Obama's dangerous doctrine, which fears American power more than it fears our enemies. As secretary of state, Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  contributed enormously to lowering the barriers to aggression everywhere -- with much worse to come unless we reverse course.\par \par \uc2 The internationalist conservatives who oppose Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  on foreign-policy grounds have a point. But they shouldn't fool themselves that they will get something better with Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 ---\par \par \uc2 Mr. Kaufman, a professor of public policy at Pepperdine University, is the author of "Dangerous Doctrine: How Obama's Grand Strategy Weakened America" (University Press of Kentucky, 2016).\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=wjco20160915000043"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document J000000020160915ec9f0003y\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw272\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4080\pichgoal600

\par\par \b \uc2 The Republican Senate Isn't a Lost Cause\b0\par\par\uc2 By Karl Rove   \par \uc2 865 \uc2 words\par \uc2 15 September 2016\par \uc2 The Wall Street Journal\par \uc2 J\par A13\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 Obscured by the drama of the presidential campaign is a battle royal for the \uc2 U.S. Senate\uc2 . Today Republicans control the upper chamber with 54 seats to Democrats' 46. But the balance could tip either way in November, making or breaking the agenda of President \uc2 Trump\uc2  or President \uc2 Clinton\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Next year's Senate will include at least 44 Republicans: 30 who are not up for re-\uc2 election\uc2  this fall, and 14 who face only nominal challengers. On the other side of the aisle will be at least 45 Democrats: 36 who are not up for re-\uc2 election\uc2 , and nine who face only nominal opposition.\par \par \uc2 That leaves 11 seats up for grabs. Democrats now hold one of these: Nevada. Republicans hold 10: Arizona, Florida, Illinois, Indiana, Missouri, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. For the GOP this isn't all friendly territory: Seven of these 11 states went for President \uc2 Obama\uc2  twice.\par \par \uc2 To maintain Senate control, Republicans must win seven of these races. (Or six if \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  is elected, since the vice president holds the tiebreaking vote in a chamber split 50-50.)\par \par \uc2 Democrats believe that their best chances to knock off Republican incumbents are Illinois and Wisconsin. In the former, Republican Sen. Mark Kirk won his deep-blue state in 2010 by only 1.6 percentage points. Mr. Kirk is running an aggressive campaign, while his opponent, Rep. Tammy Duckworth, has yet to unite Democrats. Still, he has his work cut out for him. In Wisconsin, Republican Sen. Ron Johnson faces an attempted comeback by the man he defeated six years ago, former Sen. Russ Feingold. Mr. Johnson trails, but tenacious campaigning has brought him to within 3 points, according to a \uc2 Marquette University\uc2  poll from late August.\par \par \uc2 In Florida and Indiana, Democrats had hoped to easily claim open Republican seats. The Sunshine State's \uc2 Sen. Marco Rubio\uc2  had opted to run for president instead of re-\uc2 election\uc2 . But at the last minute Mr. Rubio re-entered the race. Then his opponent, Democratic Rep. Patrick Murphy, had his claimed resume challenged by a Miami TV news report. Mr. Rubio now leads by 5.4 points.\par \par \uc2 In Indiana the Democrat, former Sen. Evan Bayh, is up by a similar margin. Mr. Bayh retired six years ago, but Democrats substituted him for their lackluster nominee in July. Voters have since soured after learning that Mr. Bayh hasn't lived in Indiana since retiring. Republicans picked a superb candidate in Rep. Todd Young, a Naval Academy grad and Marine, who is hitting Mr. Bayh for supporting ObamaCare, the stimulus and cap-and-trade.\par \par \uc2 As a result, Democrats are moving money into Missouri, North Carolina and Nevada. The Show-Me State's Republican Sen. Roy Blunt, a leader on veterans' issues, is up by 4.8 points. He faces Secretary of State Jason Kander, a supporter of ObamaCare and a national energy tax who was given an "F" rating from the \uc2 NRA\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 In North Carolina, Republican Sen. Richard Burr leads by 3.3 points. He faces a former state director of the ACLU, Deborah Ross, who defended flag burning while refusing to aid a veteran seeking to overturn his condo association's rule against flag displays. She also sought to ban Christmas songs from elementary schools. That might play better in Vermont.\par \par \uc2 The Nevada race to replace the retiring Sen. Harry Reid is tight. GOP Rep. Joe Heck has had a slim lead, 1.2 points. This is due in part to questions about Democrat Catherine Cortez-Masto performance as state attorney general. But Mr. Heck, a doctor and general in the Army Reserves, also has crossover appeal.\par \par \uc2 In two states, Democratic hopes may be evaporating. By taking nothing for granted, Arizona Sen. John McCain has climbed to a 13.7-point lead in the Real Clear Politics average. Ohio's Sen. Rob Portman is running this year's best campaign and gaining support from blue-collar unions. Mr. Portman is up by 12.4 points in the polling average, and national Democrats are pulling funding and turning elsewhere.\par \par \uc2 The remaining two contests are expensive all-out wars. In Pennsylvania, Republican Sen. Pat Toomey is in a statistical tie. His focus on law enforcement and defense has won Democratic and independent support. Democrat Katie McGinty comes off as a partisan who isn't ready for prime time. In New Hampshire, Republican Sen. Kelly Ayotte is now up 1.8 points. She has led the fight against opioid abuse while becoming a respected defense expert, which is why her opponent, Democrat Gov. Maggie Hassan, refuses to participate in a foreign-policy debate.\par \par \uc2 The GOP is blessed with excellent candidates who are mounting strong campaigns and running ahead of Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 . If they keep this up, Republicans may well hold the Senate -- though it will probably come down to a few thousand votes, in a handful of states, and decided very late on \uc2 election\uc2  night.\par \par \uc2 ---\par \par \uc2 Mr. Rove helped organize the political-action committee American Crossroads and is the author of "The Triumph of William McKinley" (\uc2 Simon & Schuster\uc2 , 2015).\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=wjco20160915000041"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document J000000020160915ec9f0003w\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 EDITORIAL\par \uc2 Editorial Desk; SECTA\par \b \uc2 What's Deplorable\b0\par\par\uc2 By THE EDITORIAL BOARD \par \uc2 562 \uc2 words\par \uc2 14 September 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 26\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 It's hard to believe now, but there was a time in American politics, not so long ago, when a presidential candidate might hold only a few fund-raisers, when a serving president -- Ronald Reagan, for example -- might refuse to appear at any fund-raisers at all for his own re-\uc2 election\uc2  campaign. That was back before wily political operatives, and then the Supreme Court, opened the floodgates to cash, and candidates began holding fund-raisers by the score.\par \par \uc2 And as candidates spent more and more time cocooned with their wealthiest supporters, who were often also among their most ideological supporters, they made themselves vulnerable to a particular kind of influence. Not just the kind journalists are ever on the watch for -- the classic quid pro quo -- but a more subtle form, a cultural form that tends to be heard and not seen.\par \par \uc2 We heard it in 1995, when, running for re-\uc2 election\uc2 , President \uc2 Bill \uc2 Clinton\uc2  delighted donors in Houston by saying: ''Probably there are people in this room still mad at me at that budget because you think I raised your taxes too much. It might surprise you to know that I think I raised them too much, too.'' Congressional Democrats who put their careers on the line to pass that tax increase were furious.\par \par \uc2 We heard it again in 2008, when \uc2 Barack Obama\uc2  told donors in San Francisco that people struggling in Pennsylvania towns ''cling to guns or religion or antipathy to people who aren't like them.''\par \par \uc2 We heard it when \uc2 Mitt Romney\uc2  told donors in Florida that ''there are 47 percent of the people'' who ''are dependent upon government, who believe that they are victims ... my job is not to worry about those people.''\par \par \uc2 And we heard it again last week, when \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , speaking at a fund-raiser on Wall Street, deposited ''half of \uc2 Trump\uc2 's supporters'' into what she rather bizarrely called ''the basket of deplorables.'' The donors -- the adorables? -- had a good chuckle.\par \par \uc2 Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  went on to point out that there are other \uc2 Trump\uc2  supporters ''we have to understand and empathize with,'' people who are ''just desperate for change.'' And she later expressed regret for her remarks. But real damage had been done. In wooing one group of voters -- in reading some members of her elite audience, and reflecting their feelings back to them, and perhaps revealing her own -- she had written off another one as ''irredeemable.'' This is what happens when candidates spend so much time in what F. Scott Fitzgerald called ''the consoling proximity of millionaires.''\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , a self-declared billionaire, has also been holding fund-raisers, despite saying in the primaries he would fund his own campaign. He is not letting the press listen in. Although one might wonder what Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  is telling people who have paid up to $250,000 to hear him, it is almost too painful to think about, given how offensive he is in public.\par \par \uc2 Our campaigns have become so dependent on the wealthy that we are at risk of forgetting that there is any other way to do politics -- and our candidates are at risk of forgetting whom they are running to represent.\par \par \uc2 Follow The \uc2 New York Times\uc2  Opinion section on \uc2 Facebook\uc2  and \uc2 Twitter\uc2  (@NYTOpinion), and sign up for the Opinion Today newsletter.\par \par \uc2 Document NYTF000020160914ec9e0006n\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 Express; SECT\par \b \uc2 Will \uc2 Trump\uc2  Release His Tax Returns? Billionaire Pledges Up to $5 Million for Veterans if So\b0\par\par\uc2 By CHRISTINE HAUSER \par \uc2 806 \uc2 words\par \uc2 14 September 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 The New York Times on the Web\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 The billionaire co-founder of LinkedIn, \uc2 Reid Hoffman\uc2 , has pledged to give up to $5 million to veterans groups if \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2  agrees to release his tax returns before the Oct. 19 presidential debate.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Hoffman announced his challenge in a statement published Monday on Medium that said he was offering a matching donation to support a crowdfunding campaign started by Peter Kiernan, a former Marine.\par \par \uc2 By midday Tuesday, Mr. Kiernan's fund-raising on Crowdpac.com had raised more than $74,000 toward its $1 million goal of donating funds to 10 nonprofit organizations that help war veterans. Mr. Hoffman offered to match those donations 5 to 1 up to $5 million.\par \par \uc2 He said that offer was inspired by Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's own pledge in 2012 to donate that amount to a charity if President Obama revealed his college and passport records and applications. At the time, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  had been questioning whether Mr. Obama was born in the United States (indeed he was, in Hawaii).\par \par \uc2 ''Taking \uc2 Trump\uc2 's own 2012 offer to President Obama into account, I'd like to assist Kiernan in his campaign,'' Mr. Hoffman wrote.\par \par \uc2 ''In a functioning democracy, the public shouldn't be forced to bargain with a major presidential candidate to obtain access to his tax returns,'' he wrote.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's failure to release his tax returns has drawn criticism not only from supporters of \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  but from prominent Republicans, including \uc2 Mitt Romney\uc2 , who lost to Mr. Obama in 2012. On Friday, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's running mate, \uc2 Gov. Mike Pence\uc2  of Indiana, released a decade of his own tax returns, but Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  and his campaign have said that the nominee would not release his until an \uc2 Internal Revenue Service\uc2  audit was completed.\par \par \uc2 Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  released a batch of returns last month. They showed that she and her husband, former President \uc2 Bill \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , had an adjusted gross income of $10.6 million for 2015. They paid about $3.6 million in federal taxes for an effective tax rate of about 35 percent.\par \par \uc2 Candidates are not required to release their returns, but if Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  fails to do so before the \uc2 election\uc2 , he would be the first major-party presidential nominee in four decades to withhold them. This has fueled speculation that Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's returns would reveal facts about his wealth, charitable donations, business relationships or tax arrangements that might be politically damaging.\par \par \uc2 The returns might resolve questions about Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's own charitable giving. The \uc2 Washington Post\uc2  has reported that the candidate has exaggerated the amount he has donated to veterans groups over the years.\par \par \uc2 An emailed request to the \uc2 Trump\uc2  campaign for comment about Mr. Hoffman's pledge was not immediately returned on Tuesday.\par \par \uc2 In 2002, Mr. Hoffman, formerly the chief operating officer of PayPal, formed a small team to work on what would become \uc2 LinkedIn\uc2 , a professional networking site. It was introduced in 2003. This June, \uc2 Microsoft\uc2  said it would acquire \uc2 LinkedIn\uc2  for $26.2. billion.\par \par \uc2 After posting his pledge to Medium, Mr. Hoffman later updated it to disclose that he had at one time made an investment in Crowdpac.com. A Buzzfeed report and Shane Goldmacher, a Politico reporter, noted that Mr. Hoffman had promoted Crowdpac before by signing on to a campaign to recall the judge in the \uc2 Stanford University\uc2  rape case, Aaron Persky.\par \par \uc2 ''The ingenuity of Kiernan's proposal is how it gives \uc2 Trump\uc2  a strong incentive to act but doesn't reward him directly for something he should have already done,'' Mr. Hoffman wrote. ''Instead, men and women to whom all Americans owe a great debt of gratitude will benefit from any positive action he takes.''\par \par \uc2 Mr. Hoffman's announcement was reported on Monday night by news media including Forbes, which noted that Mr. Keirnan's campaign had raised a meager $5,000 before the post.\par \par \uc2 ''This is crazy, please help me get to this goal,'' Mr. Kiernan said on his campaign page after the announcement.\par \par \uc2 A 26-year-old former Marine who served in Afghanistan in 2012, he wrote on Monday that the campaign was a way to take advantage of the ''political climate'' to raise money while also holding Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  accountable.\par \par \uc2 ''The nation entrusts its defense to this small group of talented and determined patriots, in return for this responsibility the nation asks for honesty and integrity,'' he wrote, addressing Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 . ''I believe that to be the Commander-in-Chief of this group, you should be held to the same standards.''\par \par \uc2 He noted that it would not cost Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  any money, just the release of his returns. He added: ''So what do you say Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , can you walk away from this deal?''\par \par \uc2 Document NYTF000020160914ec9e0006s\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 ASTON, Pa. -- \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2  unveiled a menu of proposals on Tuesday to help working parents, calling for six weeks of mandatory paid maternity leave and expanded tax credits for child care.\par \par \uc2 The proposals, which Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  outlined in the politically critical Philadelphia suburbs along with his daughter Ivanka, represent a new attempt to court female voters who polls show have been alienated by his bombast and history of provocative remarks about women.\par \par \uc2 ''Those in leadership must put themselves in the shoes of the laid-off factory worker, the family worried about security or the mom struggling to afford child care,'' Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  said at a rally here.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's decision to put forward such a plan represents a different approach from the one taken by previous Republican presidential nominees.\par \par \uc2 But in selling his case, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  stretched the truth, saying that his Democratic rival, \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , has no such plan of her own and ''never will.''\par \par \uc2 Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  issued her plan more than a year ago, and it guarantees up to 12 weeks of paid family and medical leave for a newborn or a sick relative, financed by an increase in taxes on the wealthiest Americans. On \uc2 Twitter\uc2 , her campaign posted a link to her plan after Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's remark.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  and his daughter spoke about the issue at the Republican National Convention in July, but the candidate had not mentioned it publicly until Tuesday. Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  faces a potentially record-high gender gap with women, but pushing the proposal so close to the \uc2 election\uc2  risks looking slapdash on a serious topic.\par \par \uc2 The campaign staved off potential complaints from social conservatives who have historically frowned on giving incentives to mothers to work outside the home, by vowing to make those caretaker roles tax-deductible.\par \par \uc2 At the speech, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  was joined by some female members of Congress. Noting one applauding in the audience as he spoke, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  pointed to the crowd and said, ''Makes your life a lot easier, right?''\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  first proposed the child care initiative weeks ago, but he broadened it to help working parents after facing criticism that his initial proposal would primarily help high earners rather than women and families on the lower end of the economic spectrum.\par \par \uc2 ''Child care is such a big problem,'' he said Tuesday. ''And we're going to solve that problem.''\par \par \uc2 Ms. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , who stood next to her father as he spoke in Pennsylvania, said she would make the plan's passage a priority if her father won. Affordable child care ''should not be the luxury of a fortunate few,'' she said.\par \par \uc2 The new recommendations contained a number of uncertainties, most notably how Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  would pay for them, and they still favor people with higher incomes. The candidate's aides said his goals would be achieved through a change in the tax code to help pay for child care, to be detailed in another speech, probably this week.\par \par \uc2 The main thrust of Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's plan involves a reordering of the tax code so working parents can take an income tax deduction for care of up to four children and older-adult dependents. The deduction is available for individuals earning up to $250,000, or $500,000 for a married couple filing jointly.\par \par \uc2 There would also be child care spending rebates as high as $1,200 a year for families on the lower end of the income scale.\par \par \uc2 That is an amount that some critics called inadequate given that the cost of child care in some states is $10,000 to $20,000 a year.\par \par \uc2 Another proposal aimed at lower-income parents is a dependent care savings account, a version of a flexible spending account usually offered by employers. Such accounts would be universal and used for after-school or traditional child care, with a government match of $500 a year -- a minuscule amount given the cost of such care, and given the difficulty that lower-income families have putting away money in such accounts.\par \par \uc2 Among the open questions are whether the deductions that working parents could claim would replace the existing earned-income tax credit, whether there would be an age cap for the children involved, and what the actual scale of benefit would be for people of various incomes.\par \par \uc2 The signature element of the plan, six weeks of paid maternity leave for new mothers whose employers do not currently provide coverage, would be financed by eliminating fraud in unemployment insurance.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's aides trumpeted the proposal as unprecedented for a G.O.P. presidential nominee; many Republicans oppose requiring paid maternity leave as an onerous new regulation on businesses.\par \par \uc2 Earlier Tuesday, at a campaign rally in Clive, Iowa, the candidate singled out \uc2 Ivanka \uc2 Trump\uc2 , a mother of three who has developed her own licensing and branding company, as the driving force behind the plan.\par \par \uc2 Some social conservatives said they were pleasantly surprised by Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's proposed tax benefit for stay-at-home mothers.\par \par \uc2 ''I was quite pleased with it,'' said \uc2 Tony Perkins\uc2  of the conservative \uc2 Family Research Council\uc2 . He called it ''innovative'' in acknowledging ''the contribution that stay-at-home parents make.''\par \par \uc2 But the plan was met with criticism from the \uc2 Clinton\uc2  campaign and skepticism from some child care advocacy groups, which warned that the people most in need of relief would not get it.\par \par \uc2 ''After spending his entire career -- and this entire campaign -- demeaning women and dismissing the need to support working families,'' Maya Harris, Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's senior policy adviser, said in a statement, ''\uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  released a regressive and insufficient 'maternity leave' policy that is out of touch, half-baked and ignores the way Americans live and work today.''\par \par \uc2 Vivien Labaton, a director of the nonpartisan group Make It Work Action, called Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's plan ''woefully inadequate.''\par \par \uc2 She said the earned-income tax credit component meant that families in need would have to wait to receive relief just once a year, and called the $1,200 rebate a ''drop in the bucket'' for low-income families who were facing child care costs of more than $10,000 a year.\par \par \uc2 Paid leave has increasing political resonance. One of the major reasons the share of women working in the United States has fallen behind other developed countries is the lack of paid family leave, according to research by \uc2 Cornell University\uc2  economists.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's embrace of paid leave would apply only to mothers, as opposed to Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's plan, which would cover both parents.\par \par \uc2 Some economists say that when leave is offered only to women, it can backfire by lowering women's chances of being hired and promoted and getting raises.\par \par \uc2 Ms. Labaton expressed skepticism about the proposal ''coming less than 60 days before \uc2 Election\uc2  Day,'' deriding it as ''a naked attempt to court women voters while not actually offering up much by way of genuine support.''\par \par \uc2 Find out what you need to know about the 2016 presidential race today, and get politics news updates via \uc2 Facebook\uc2 , \uc2 Twitter\uc2  and the First Draft newsletter.\par \par \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2  after a speech Tuesday in Aston, Pa. Social conservatives praised his child care plan, but some groups had doubts.

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Let's assume, just for the sake of argument, that \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  and his supporters on the deplorable right actually mean what they say and are not just spewing sound bites for fun or attention.\par \par \uc2 If that's the case, here are some of the things they want Americans to believe:\par \par \uc2 Vladimir Putin\uc2 , an unabashed dictator who invades other countries, tramples on his people's civil and human rights, and has the blood of Russian journalists on his hands is the proper role model for an American president.\par \par \uc2 Disgruntled right-wingers would be justified to rise in armed rebellion if they don't like the results in November. Because of course that's what Thomas Jefferson and the other founding fathers had in mind when they set in motion more than 200 years of peaceful transfer of power.\par \par \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  has a fatal illness and the national media are conspiring to cover it up. (Why have I never been invited to join these conspiracies?)\par \par \uc2 The list goes on and on, and I have not even mentioned the idea that building walls on our borders and starting trade wars with countries like China would somehow jumpstart the American economy.\par \par \uc2 Just this past weekend, the Republican governor of Kentucky, Matt Bevin, told the hilariously named ''Values Voter Summit'' that there could be bloodshed if \uc2 Clinton\uc2  is elected this fall.\par \par \uc2 ''The roots of the tree of liberty are watered by what?'' he said. ''The blood, of who? The tyrants, to be sure, but who else? The patriots. Whose blood will be shed? It may be that of those in this room. It might be that of our children and grandchildren.''\par \par \uc2 (Bevin was taking some liberties with a quote from Jefferson, who actually said that the blood of patriots is the ''manure'' of the tree of liberty, which is a better description for Bevin's comments.)\par \par \uc2 Bevin went on to talk about Islamic extremists who threaten American freedoms. But he clearly was echoing the view of some extremists, including \uc2 Trump\uc2  himself, who have suggested that violence might be an appropriate response to a \uc2 Clinton\uc2  victory.\par \par \uc2 The Republicans call themselves the party of Abraham Lincoln, but seem to have forgotten that Lincoln took the nation to war to put down an illegitimate insurrection by Southern states who objected to his \uc2 election\uc2 . Maybe they just remember his suspension of habeas corpus, the kind of steel-fisted governing that \uc2 Trump\uc2  admires so much in Putin.\par \par \uc2 At the town hall meeting last week where Matt Lauer made a national fool of himself, \uc2 Trump\uc2  said he admired Putin because he ''has very strong control over a country.'' He added: ''It's a very different system, and I don't happen to like the system, but certainly in that system, he's been a leader. Far more than our president has been a leader.''\par \par \uc2 This is moral relativism in its most base form. Does \uc2 Trump\uc2  believe that Stalin, Mao and Hitler were even greater leaders? They had ''very strong control'' -- even if the systems they ran were mind-bogglingly brutal. They also were, ultimately, failures. Putin is such a good leader that he has presided over the economic collapse of his country.\par \par \uc2 A presidential candidate's health, meanwhile, is actually relevant to voters. But it's hard to believe that \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's attackers really care about that. Questioning her physical well-being is just another way to throw mud at her.\par \par \uc2 The ideas that have turned this \uc2 election\uc2  into such a farce are not just dangerous and appalling by the standards of American democracy and political traditions. They also violate just about every principle the Republican conservatives have been voicing since the days of Ronald Reagan, whom the Grand Old Party still claims as its icon.\par \par \uc2 (I can just imagine \uc2 Trump\uc2  in Reagan's place, standing in Berlin and yelling ''Mr. Gorbachev, nice wall!'')\par \par \uc2 The situation has gotten so dire, \uc2 Politico\uc2  reported recently, that former President George W. Bush told a reunion of members of his staff in April: ''I'm worried that I will be the last Republican president.''\par \par \uc2 Actually, the Republican Party that Reagan built has been moribund since the rise of the Tea Party and the do-nothing Congress led by Mitch McConnell and \uc2 John Boehner\uc2 . If \uc2 Trump\uc2  finally kills it with his conspiracy-mongering, immigrant-bashing, race-baiting and Kremlin-loving, it will just be a coup de gr\u226\'00\'E2ce.\par \par \uc2 Follow The \uc2 New York Times\uc2  Opinion section on \uc2 Facebook\uc2  and \uc2 Twitter\uc2  (@NYTOpinion), and sign up for the Opinion Today newsletter.\par \par \uc2 Document NYTF000020160914ec9e0005x\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 Politics; SECT\par \b \uc2 Pneumonia, Polyps and Gunshots: A Short History of Presidential Health\b0\par\par\uc2 By ALAN RAPPEPORT \par \uc2 951 \uc2 words\par \uc2 14 September 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 The New York Times on the Web\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's bout of pneumonia and the criticism of how little she and her opponent, \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , have made public about their medical histories thrust questions of transparency about health to the center of the presidential campaign this week, with both candidates promising to release more detailed records in the coming days.\par \par \uc2 While the public scrutiny of modern campaigns has made speculation about the health of presidential candidates more relentless, concerns about the fitness of candidates for office have long been a hallmark of American politics, with many hopefuls trying to conceal their maladies and opponents doing their best to exploit signs of weakness.\par \par \uc2 From brushing off gunshot wounds to working through paralysis, presidents, and those seeking the office, have been no strangers to challenging ailments. Here are a few of history's most prominent examples.\par \par \uc2 William Henry Harrison\par \par \uc2 The revelation that Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  had pneumonia instantly drew comparisons to William Henry Harrison, the ninth president, whose tenure was the shortest in the country's history. Harrison died from pneumonia, according to his doctor, in 1841, a month after delivering a two-hour inaugural address on a blustery day.\par \par \uc2 Being underdressed in bad weather was blamed for causing an illness that quickly spiraled out of control. Doctors treated him with opium and other medications that proved to be useless.\par \par \uc2 Historians continue to debate the true cause of Harrison's death, and some scholars have wondered whether his history of dyspepsia, rather than pneumonia, was really to blame. According to one theory, the White House's lack of a proper sewage system may have contaminated its water supply with pathogens that poisoned the president.\par \par \uc2 _____\par \par \uc2 Theodore Roosevelt\par \par \uc2 Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's campaign said that she had wanted to push through her pneumonia after it was diagnosed last Friday. For Douglas Brinkley, a Rice University historian, the urge to put politics before health echoed Theodore Roosevelt.\par \par \uc2 In 1912, Roosevelt, a former president, was running again with the Progressive ''Bull Moose'' Party when he was shot in the chest before he was to deliver a speech in Milwaukee. The manuscript of the speech, which was in his coat pocket, cushioned the blow and saved his life. Gritting through the pain, he delivered a shortened version of the speech anyway, declaring, ''It takes more than that to kill a bull moose.''\par \par \uc2 ''He thought if he went to a hospital and seemed infirm, it would lower his chances of winning,'' Mr. Brinkley said of Roosevelt, who ultimately lost the \uc2 election\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 _____\par \par \uc2 Woodrow Wilson\par \par \uc2 President Woodrow Wilson had a debilitating stroke in 1919, leaving him incapacitated and raising questions about who was really running the executive branch.\par \par \uc2 Scholars such as Edwin A. Weinstein, a neuropsychiatrist, spent years studying Wilson's old correspondence to determine that he had experienced smaller strokes dating back to 1898, which might have foreshadowed his health problems later in life.\par \par \uc2 Transparency was particularly problematic at the time, as Wilson's wife, Edith, and his doctor allegedly orchestrated a cover-up to prevent the public from learning about his deteriorating condition.\par \par \uc2 _____\par \par \uc2 Franklin D. Roosevelt\par \par \uc2 Health was always something of a concern for Franklin D. Roosevelt, who was partly paralyzed and was vigilant about keeping his wheelchair hidden from the public. But it was when he sought his fourth term as president in 1944 that his opponents seized on his diminished strength and failing faculties in hopes of finally defeating him.\par \par \uc2 Documents in Roosevelt's presidential library show how the ''whispering campaign'' of his rival Thomas E. Dewey tried to paint Roosevelt as a ''tired old man,'' and how Roosevelt campaigned more aggressively to demonstrate that he still had vigor. Privately, Roosevelt's doctors had warned that he had high blood pressure and was at a high risk of heart failure.\par \par \uc2 In April 1945, Roosevelt collapsed and died from a cerebral hemorrhage.\par \par \uc2 _____\par \par \uc2 John F. Kennedy\par \par \uc2 In 1960, John F. Kennedy declared himself the ''healthiest candidate for president in the country.'' But despite his youthful good looks, Kennedy was battling a variety of ailments, including Addison's disease, an autoimmune disorder that affects the adrenal glands.\par \par \uc2 Despite efforts by his family to hide the disorder, which can be life-threatening, pathologists who conducted his autopsy revealed in 1992 that Kennedy, who was assassinated at the age of 46, had been taking hormone replacement supplements to control the rare condition. Some suggested that he might have lost the 1960 \uc2 election\uc2  to Richard M.

\par\par \uc2 National Desk; SECTA\par \b \uc2 Pence Finds Unity Elusive in a Visit to Capitol Hill\b0\par\par\uc2 By JONATHAN MARTIN and ALEXANDER BURNS; Jonathan Martin reported from Washington, and Alexander Burns from New York. \par \uc2 1,253 \uc2 words\par \uc2 14 September 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 18\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 WASHINGTON -- \uc2 Gov. Mike Pence\uc2  came to Capitol Hill on Tuesday on a mission to promote Republican unity, attacking \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  for describing many supporters of the G.O.P. ticket as bigoted ''deplorables'' and urging Republicans to rally behind their nominee, \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 But Mr. Pence struggled to press the attack: In separate news conferences, House and Senate Republican leaders declined to join Mr. Pence, the Indiana governor and vice-presidential nominee, in rebuking Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  over her remark.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Pence wound up raising the subject only when pressed by a reporter -- and then gave a halting answer in which he would not call David Duke, a white supremacist and onetime Ku Klux Klan leader, ''deplorable.'' He insisted instead that Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  did not have ''that bad man'' in mind when she assailed Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's supporters.\par \par \uc2 It was a noticeable break in stride for the \uc2 Trump\uc2  campaign, which had zeroed in on Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's remark at a Manhattan fund-raiser Friday night -- one for which she expressed regret the next day -- running a new commercial and dispatching surrogates to attack her for what Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  has termed a ''slander'' of his ''wonderful, amazing'' followers.\par \par \uc2 Congressional Republicans were even blunter in private.\par \par \uc2 An otherwise friendly morning meeting with House Republicans turned awkward when Mr. Pence was pressed by Representative Jeff Fortenberry of Nebraska about Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's difficulties with women, said two House Republicans who relayed the conversation. Mr. Fortenberry told Mr. Pence that his young daughter had come to him and said, ''Daddy, \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  hates women,'' according to one of the lawmakers, who both insisted on anonymity to recount a private conversation.\par \par \uc2 ''It's just not true,'' Mr. Pence shot back, arguing that Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  was improving with women, the two House Republicans said.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Pence faced resistance again when he met privately with Senators Mike Lee of Utah and Ted Cruz of Texas, neither of whom has endorsed Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 . Mr. Lee pressed the governor on his reluctance to denounce Mr. Duke and the so-called alt-right movement more explicitly, stressing ''that Republicans must identify David Duke's racism as deplorable,'' according to Conn Carroll, a spokesman for Mr. Lee.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Pence was greeted warmly by Senate Republicans when he joined them for a lunch of \uc2 Chick-fil-A\uc2  sandwiches, but received a firm rebuke from \uc2 John McCain\uc2  of Arizona, the chairman of the Armed Services Committee. Calling \uc2 Vladimir V. Putin\uc2 , the Russian president, ''a thug and a butcher,'' Mr. McCain said Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's embrace of the autocratic ruler was unacceptable, according to a Republican official present who also insisted on anonymity.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Pence insisted that he and Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  were trying to belittle President Obama rather than to laud Mr. Putin.\par \par \uc2 The very nature of Mr. Pence's visit to Capitol Hill offered some insights as to why Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , who had his own testy visit with Senate Republicans here in July, is still confronting difficulties with his party. Playing the part of troubleshooting diplomat as much as running mate, Mr. Pence spent much of the day behind closed doors reassuring his former colleagues, with whom he retains close ties, that they could trust Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 . Mr. Pence said Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  behaved differently in private, and even had a spiritual side.\par \par \uc2 Congressional Republicans said they were pleased that the presidential race was tightening and that Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  appeared more viable, partly because their own prospects depend on his being competitive enough that Republicans still bother to vote.\par \par \uc2 With his modest uptick in the polls, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  may have forestalled an outright break with Republicans in Congress. As recently as a few weeks ago, party leaders and strategists in Washington were preparing to take emergency measures, having their candidates disavow Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  and present themselves to voters as a counterweight to a President \uc2 Clinton\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Republicans may still activate those plans if Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  stumbles badly against Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  in the final stretch of the race. But for now, the party has adopted a middle-ground approach, with most Republicans in Washington nominally supporting Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  while advancing campaign messages that differ widely from his in almost every respect.\par \par \uc2 That distance was on display when congressional Republicans refrained from echoing Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's indictment of Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  over her saying that half his supporters were bigots, sexists and homophobes.\par \par \uc2 Few Republicans want to confront thorny follow-up questions about Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's supporters, and fewer still want to make matters of race, gender and sexual orientation central to their campaigns. The silence about what has for the last three days been at the core of Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's campaign also underscored a more fundamental gap: Republicans on Capitol Hill have their own agenda and intend to run their campaigns apart from Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  -- not as a unified ticket.\par \par \uc2 So Speaker Paul D. Ryan tried to use his news conference with Mr. Pence to promote his own ''Better Way'' proposals on the economy, military and poverty, which were formulated separately from the \uc2 Trump\uc2  campaign.\par \par \uc2 David Winston, a Republican pollster who advises congressional leaders, said lawmakers were right to focus on their own political interests.\par \par \uc2 ''That's a \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  statement, and that's who \uc2 Trump\uc2  is running against,'' Mr. Winston said of the ''deplorables'' debate. ''For a lot of these members, what they're trying to do is define their view of the future in contrast to what they're facing. These are members representing individual districts with specific concerns.''\par \par \uc2 That Mr. Pence had to assume a Willy Loman-meets-Henry Kissinger role and sell elected Republicans on Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's merits less than two months before \uc2 Election\uc2  Day illustrates the unique challenges Republicans are facing.\par \par \uc2 By contrast, Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia, Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's running mate, is spending much of his time appealing to voters in swing states -- not pleading with recalcitrant Democrats in Senate cloakrooms to endorse their nominee.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Pence was plainly unable to win over Republican holdouts. Representative Carlos Curbelo, a first-term Florida congressman who has said he will not vote for Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , was left pining for an alternative reality.\par \par \uc2 ''The country would probably be more pleased with the vice-presidential candidates than the two candidates at the top,'' Mr. Curbelo said with a grin.\par \par \uc2 Representative Lee Zeldin of New York, a Long Island Republican who supports Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , said it was widely accepted that some Republicans would seek distance from the national ticket and focus on a congressional agenda.\par \par \uc2 But Mr. Zeldin urged Republicans to take sides in the presidential race, and said he planned to talk ''not only about issues impacting the next Congress, but also understanding that who is in the White House is important.''\par \par \uc2 ''There are people watching this race as if there's another option that's going to win on Nov. 8,'' Mr. Zeldin said. ''It's \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  versus \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , not \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  versus \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  versus Ronald Reagan arriving as a white knight and becoming a substitute and winning.''\par \par \uc2 Find out what you need to know about the 2016 presidential race today, and get politics news updates via \uc2 Facebook\uc2 , \uc2 Twitter\uc2  and the First Draft newsletter.\par \par \uc2 Gov.

\par\par \uc2 Business/Financial Desk; SECTA\par \b \uc2 Incomes in U.S. Are Up Sharply; Poor Gain Most\b0\par\par\uc2 By BINYAMIN APPELBAUM; Nick Corasaniti contributed from Clive, Iowa \par \uc2 1,361 \uc2 words\par \uc2 14 September 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 1\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 WASHINGTON -- Americans last year reaped the largest economic gains in nearly a generation as poverty fell, health insurance coverage spread and incomes rose sharply for households on every rung of the economic ladder, ending years of stagnation.\par \par \uc2 The median household's income in 2015 was $56,500, up 5.2 percent from the previous year -- the largest single-year increase since record-keeping began in 1967, the Census Bureau said on Tuesday. The share of Americans living in poverty also posted the sharpest decline in decades.\par \par \uc2 The gains were an important milestone for the economic expansion that began in 2009. For the first time in recent years, the benefits of renewed prosperity are spreading broadly.\par \par \uc2 The data was released into a heated presidential race, where Democrats seized on the statistics to promote \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's candidacy and undercut \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's dark assessment of the nation's well-being.\par \par \uc2 ''It has been a long slog from the depths of the Great Recession, but things are finally starting to improve for many American households,'' said Chris G. Christopher Jr., director of consumer economics at IHS Global Insight. He said the gains had continued this year.\par \par \uc2 The economic recovery, however, remains incomplete. The median household income was still 1.6 percent lower than in 2007, adjusting for inflation. It also remained 2.4 percent lower than the peak reached during the boom of the late 1990s. The number of people living in poverty also remained elevated, although it shrank last year by about 3.5 million, or roughly 8 percent.\par \par \uc2 Mark R. Rank, a professor of social welfare at Washington University in St. Louis, said the new data ''is obviously good news.'' But he noted that poverty and income inequality in the United States remained more extreme than in most developed countries. ''It would take a lot to move that needle,'' he said.\par \par \uc2 The Census Bureau also reported that the share of Americans with health insurance continued to increase. It said that only 9.1 percent of the population had no health insurance last year.\par \par \uc2 Several states, including Alaska, Indiana and Pennsylvania, expanded their Medicaid programs in 2015, taking advantage of increased federal funding under the Affordable Care Act. Private sector coverage also increased as companies hired more workers and offered them better benefits.\par \par \uc2 With the presidential \uc2 election\uc2  looming in less than two months, the annual report provided immediate fodder.\par \par \uc2 ''We lifted three and a half million people out of poverty, the largest one-year drop in poverty since 1968,'' President Obama said on Tuesday at a rally in Philadelphia for Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 . ''The uninsured rate is the lowest since they began keeping records. The pay gap between men and women shrank to the lowest level on record,'' he said, adding, ''Thanks, Obama.''\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , the Republican nominee, has repeatedly cited the stagnation of household income as evidence of a broader economic malaise. He did not address the new report directly at a rally in Clive, Iowa, but he said the Obama administration's economic policies had failed.\par \par \uc2 ''Poverty is beyond belief,'' Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  said. ''It's time to break up the failed Democratic control over our inner cities, and provide real hope and opportunity to every single community in this nation.''\par \par \uc2 The Census Bureau's annual report, based on a survey of 95,000 households, is the latest evidence that 2015 was a good year for the economy. Employers added more than three million jobs as the unemployment rate fell to 5 percent. Hourly pay increased by 2 percent, adjusting for inflation. Americans drove more miles in their cars. Even housing showed some signs of a revival.\par \par \uc2 The details of the bureau's report revealed that the gains last year were both broad and deep. Notably, lower-income households saw the largest income gains in percentage terms. Real household incomes rose 7.9 percent for households in the 10th percentile and 6.3 percent for those in the 20th percentile. By contrast, the increase was only 2.9 percent for those households in the 90th percentile.\par \par \uc2 ''You know the old saying, 'When the economy sniffles, the least advantaged catch pneumonia?''' said Jared Bernstein, an economist at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a Washington research organization, and a former adviser to Vice President \uc2 Joseph R. Biden Jr\uc2 . ''Well, that works the other way, too. The benefits of closing in on full employment disproportionately flow to the least advantaged.''\par \par \uc2 The increase in median income outpaced average income, which rose 4.5 percent to $79,263. The median income is the amount that divides households evenly between those that make less and those that make more. Average income is generally higher because some households make a lot more.\par \par \uc2 The gains, however, came mostly from job growth rather than wage growth. More people are working, but many of them are still struggling to maintain their standard of living.\par \par \uc2 Jeff Labruzzo, 56, said he was still earning significantly less than before the recession. Mr. Labruzzo, who lives in southwest Louisiana, treats building sites for termites before concrete is poured. The construction business remains soft, and Mr. Labruzzo said he faced increased competition from firms that employ illegal immigrants. He had five workers, but he recently let two of them go.\par \par \uc2 ''Things are to the point where I'm thinking about just closing up the business and letting my income drop,'' Mr. Labruzzo said. As a veteran, he said he could then qualify for government health benefits.\par \par \uc2 Last year's income gains do not fundamentally alter the economy's long-term trajectory. Growth remains slow despite the \uc2 Federal Reserve\uc2 's campaign to stimulate the economy. Predictions of faster growth, followed a few months later by disappointment, have become an annual ritual.\par \par \uc2 Both Fed officials and outside economists argue that stronger growth requires action by fiscal policy makers. But Democrats and Republicans are at loggerheads over the best steps, and there is little suggestion that a breakthrough is in the offing.\par \par \uc2 ''It is encouraging that our economic recovery is lifting Americans out of poverty and boosting wages,'' said Representative \uc2 Nancy Pelosi\uc2  of California, the minority leader. ''But instead of building on this progress, Washington Republicans want to turn back the clock.''\par \par \uc2 Republicans responded in kind, presenting the data as evidence Democrats should step aside.\par \par \uc2 ''Today's report is another disappointing confirmation that too many Americans are still struggling to provide for their families and reach their full potential,'' said Representative Kevin Brady of Texas, the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee. ''The federal government invests billions of dollars each year in programs to help low-income Americans, but more than 43 million people continue to live in poverty.''\par \par \uc2 The distribution of income in the United States remains tilted toward the affluent. Last year's gains by lower-income households were not enough to shift measures of income inequality.\par \par \uc2 The data also was a mixed bag for minority groups. Poverty rates fell most sharply for African-American and Hispanic households, but their income gains were smaller than for white households.\par \par \uc2 ''One good year does not reverse decades of stagnation,'' Mr. Bernstein said. ''Middle- and low-income households need a lot more than one good year. We need to keep this going.''\par \par \uc2 Follow The \uc2 New York Times\uc2 's politics and Washington coverage on \uc2 Facebook\uc2  and \uc2 Twitter\uc2 , and sign up for the First Draft politics newsletter.\par \par \uc2 The South Side neighborhood of Columbus, Ohio, in April.

\par\par \uc2 Foreign Desk; SECTA\par \b \uc2 U.S. and Israel Seal Huge Military Aid Deal\b0\par\par\uc2 By PETER BAKER and JULIE HIRSCHFELD DAVIS; Peter Baker reported from Jerusalem, and Julie Hirschfeld Davis from Washington. \par \uc2 1,120 \uc2 words\par \uc2 14 September 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 6\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 JERUSALEM -- The United States has finalized a $38 billion package of military aid for Israel over the next 10 years, the largest of its kind ever, and the two allies plan to sign the agreement on Wednesday, American and Israeli officials said.\par \par \uc2 The State Department scheduled a ceremony to formally announce the pact, which will be signed by Jacob Nagel, the acting national security adviser to Prime Minister \uc2 Benjamin Netanyahu\uc2  of Israel, and Thomas A. Shannon Jr., the under secretary of state for political affairs. Susan E. Rice, President Obama's national security adviser who handled negotiations, plans to be on hand.\par \par \uc2 The package represents a major commitment to Israel's security in the waning months of Mr. Obama's presidency after years of fractious relations with Mr. Netanyahu over issues like the Iran nuclear agreement. Mr. Netanyahu agreed to several concessions to cement the deal rather than gamble on winning better terms from the next president.\par \par \uc2 The package will provide an average of $3.8 billion a year over the next decade to Israel, already the largest recipient of American aid, including financing for missile defense systems that defend against rockets fired by groups like Hezbollah and \uc2 Hamas\uc2 . Under a previous 10-year agreement that expires in 2018, the United States provides about $3 billion a year, but lately Congress has added up to $500 million a year for missile defense.\par \par \uc2 ''The United States has invested significantly in many of Israel's most effective defenses against terrorist threats,'' Daniel B. Shapiro, the American ambassador to Israel, said in a speech this week. He cited the Iron Dome antimissile system and the delivery by the end of this year of the first F-35 Joint Strike Fighter.\par \par \uc2 Looking ahead to the next decade, Mr. Netanyahu initially sought as much as $45 billion, but Mr. Obama refused to go that high. Money for missile defense is included in the package, and the two sides agreed not to seek additional funds from Congress over the next decade unless both agree, such as in case of a war.\par \par \uc2 The new deal will also phase out a special provision that allowed Israel to use about a quarter of the money to buy Israeli arms, an exception once intended to strengthen the small state's defense industry. Now, with Israel a robust arms exporter competing with American firms, it will have to use the American money to buy American military systems, just as other aid recipients are required to do.\par \par \uc2 ''The most important thing about this is the strategic message,'' said Ilan Goldenberg, the director of the Middle East Security Program at the Center for a New American Security. ''The fact that Obama and Netanyahu are able to get this done even when they don't agree on a lot of things and they don't have a very good personal relationship is a very strong signal that this is a vital alliance and each side recognizes it transcends politics and personalities.''\par \par \uc2 Dennis Ross, a former Middle East adviser to Mr. Obama and other presidents, noted that the agreement follows one negotiated by George W. Bush. ''If nothing else, it shows the basic American approach to Israel is, in fact, bipartisan,'' said Mr. Ross, author of ''Doomed to Succeed,'' a history of Israeli-American relations.\par \par \uc2 But the completion of the deal after nearly a year of discussions comes against the background of continuing friction between the two nations' leaders. Just in recent days, the Obama administration publicly chastised the prime minister for a provocative video in which he accused Palestinian leaders of favoring ''ethnic cleansing'' by demanding a Jew-free Palestinian state through opposing Israeli settlements in the West Bank. Palestinians said he twisted reality.\par \par \uc2 The aid package hardly signals the end of such tension. Mr. Obama's foreign policy team is debating whether he should make a final effort after the November \uc2 election\uc2  to lay out terms of a possible peace agreement between Israelis and Palestinians. Such a move could come in a presidential speech or potentially, though less likely, a resolution at the \uc2 United Nations Security Council\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 The idea would be to break out of what American officials consider the trap of waiting for one or both of the parties to step forward. While Mr. Obama's statement would hardly settle the issue, some advisers argue it might break the logjam or at least lay down a marker. Other advisers doubt it would be worth Mr. Obama's political capital in the lame-duck period after the \uc2 election\uc2  and worry it would be unwelcome if \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  wins.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Netanyahu strongly opposes such an American move, especially if it were made at the United Nations. His camp has expressed concern that once the aid agreement was finalized, Mr. Obama might feel emboldened to go ahead over Mr. Netanyahu's objections because the president could argue he had already addressed Israel's security needs.\par \par \uc2 As a result, the finalization of the aid package may not leave either side feeling especially satisfied. ''My take is, given the context, nobody feels like throwing a big party,'' said \uc2 Aaron David Miller\uc2 , a longtime Middle East peace negotiator now at the \uc2 Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Critics of Israel's policy toward the Palestinians said the United States was effectively subsidizing operations it regularly criticized.\par \par \uc2 ''We are helping the Israelis sustain the costs of the occupation we claim is unsustainable,'' said Yousef Munayyer, the executive director of the U.S. Campaign to End the Israeli Occupation, a group advocating Palestinian rights.\par \par \uc2 ''The whole policy is outdated,'' he added. ''It goes back to an era when there were major Arab-Israeli wars and when Israel was in a very different place economically. Those conditions no longer exist, even though the occupation does, and it is high time we address our complicity in it.''\par \par \uc2 Mr. Obama, however, promised to bolster Israeli security last year when he sealed an international agreement with Iran intended to curb its nuclear program. Mr. Netanyahu vociferously opposed that deal, describing it as a na\u239\'00\'EFve capitulation to Tehran that will ultimately free it from international sanctions without effectively restraining its hostile ambitions.\par \par \uc2 Negotiations on a security package since then have progressed fitfully, but White House officials insisted the aid would underscore unparalleled American support for Israeli defenses. ''Through word and deed, this administration has done more for Israel's security than any other in U.S. history,'' Ms. Rice told Congress over the summer in a letter also signed by the budget director, \uc2 Shaun Donovan\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Document NYTF000020160914ec9e0005r\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 National Desk; SECTA\par \b \uc2 Obama Urges His Backers to Help \uc2 Clinton\uc2  and Ignore 'Nonsense'\b0\par\par\uc2 By JULIE HIRSCHFELD DAVIS; Amy Chozick contributed reporting from New York. \par \uc2 1,166 \uc2 words\par \uc2 14 September 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 19\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 PHILADELPHIA -- President Obama vigorously defended \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  on Tuesday as a relentless leader who had been held to unfair standards during an uncommonly wild presidential campaign, pleading with the voters who were the core of his own support to tune out the ''reality show'' noise of the race and vote for his chosen successor.\par \par \uc2 ''We cannot afford, suddenly, to treat this like a reality show -- we can't afford to act as if there's some equivalence here,'' Mr. Obama told thousands of people at an afternoon rally in front of the \uc2 Philadelphia Museum of Art\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 ''What sets Hillary apart is that through it all, she just keeps on going, and she doesn't stop caring, and she doesn't stop trying, and she never stops fighting for us -- even if we haven't always appreciated it,'' Mr. Obama said.\par \par \uc2 The roughly 40-minute speech was by turns a condemnation of \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2  and a venting session about news coverage of a presidential race that Mr. Obama argued had focused on the ''frivolous'' while allowing Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , the Republican nominee, to go unchallenged. Its intended audience was the young and minority voters who had propelled Mr. Obama to the White House.\par \par \uc2 ''I love you, too -- but we got some business to do here,'' Mr. Obama told the crowd as it chanted his name. ''I am really into electing \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  -- like, this isn't me going through the motions here. I really, really, really want to elect \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 .''\par \par \uc2 Eight years ago, Mr. Obama defeated Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  for the Democratic nomination in large part by appealing to young people and minorities who had never participated in presidential elections but were inspired by his hopeful message and newness to politics. Now he is trying to energize those voters on behalf of a candidate whose decades-long political and policy r\u233\'00\'E9sum\u233\'00\'E9 is her chief selling point, and who struggled to draw their support during a bruising primary campaign as Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont linked her to what he characterized as the corrupt status quo.\par \par \uc2 ''We always like the new, shiny thing -- I benefited from that when I was a candidate -- and we take for granted sometimes what is steady and true, and \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  is steady, and she is true,'' Mr. Obama said. ''The young people who are here, who all you've been seeing is just the nonsense that's been on TV, you maybe don't remember all the work that she has had to do, and all the things that she has had to overcome.''\par \par \uc2 ''You can't stay home because, 'You know, she's been around for a long time,''' Mr. Obama said. ''I need you to work as hard for Hillary as you did for me.''\par \par \uc2 The president's appearance came as Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  was sidelined from the campaign to recuperate from pneumonia. Her team was toiling to shake off questions about the initial decision to keep her diagnosis secret amid questions about her health.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Obama referred obliquely to the controversy, asking the crowd gathered on a tree-lined boulevard to permit him to ''just vent for a second'' about the questions dominating the presidential campaign.\par \par \uc2 ''You know, you don't grade the presidency on a curve -- this is serious business,'' Mr. Obama said. ''You want to debate transparency? You've got one candidate in this race who's released decades' worth of her tax returns; the other candidate is the first in decades who's refused to release any at all.''\par \par \uc2 An aide to Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  said she had watched the speech on television from her home in Chappaqua, N.Y., where she spent the day reading briefings and making calls. She planned to take another day off before returning to the campaign trail Thursday.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Obama's speech was the latest turn in the evolution of his relationship with Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 . Their once-bitter rivalry transformed into a partnership when he selected her as secretary of state, and they now have a vital political alliance with consequences for both of them.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Obama seemed exhilarated to be back on the campaign trail, and he has told his advisers that he is eager to be useful to Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 . Aides say he will spend the final days of the race traveling extensively on her behalf. \uc2 Michelle Obama\uc2 , a rare and reluctant presence at political events, also plans to become involved this week, appearing at a Friday rally at \uc2 George Mason University\uc2  in Fairfax, Va., to exhort people to register before that state's Oct. 17 deadline.\par \par \uc2 On Tuesday in Philadelphia, Mr. Obama drew a sharp contrast between Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  and Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , condemning the tenor of his campaign and denouncing him for his recent praise of President \uc2 Vladimir V. Putin\uc2  of Russia.\par \par \uc2 ''Their nominee is out there praising a guy, saying he's a strong leader because he invades smaller countries, jails his opponents, controls the press and drives his economy into a long recession,'' Mr. Obama said. ''Think about the fact that that is \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2 's role model.''\par \par \uc2 In an apparent appeal to Republicans alienated by Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's candidacy, he marveled at how far the party had strayed from the principles espoused by Abraham Lincoln or Ronald Reagan.\par \par \uc2 ''He saw America as a shining city on a hill,'' Mr. Obama said, referring to Reagan. ''\uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  calls it a divided crime scene. He's not offering any real policies or plans, just offering division and offering fear. And he's betting that if he scares enough people, he might just scare up enough votes to win this \uc2 election\uc2 .''\par \par \uc2 The president also reminded voters of his accomplishments over eight years, including job and wage growth and a health care measure that provided insurance for 20 million people. ''Thanks, Obama,'' he said, adopting a phrase his critics have used sarcastically.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Obama argued that Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  was the only candidate who could build on those successes, and he ridiculed the notion that Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  would appeal to working-class voters.\par \par \uc2 ''Really?'' Mr. Obama said with a smile. ''This guy who spent 70 years on the earth showing no concern for working people?''\par \par \uc2 Mr. Obama also spent time Tuesday raising money to elect Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  and other Democrats, attending a fund-raiser at a downtown Philadelphia hotel for the Hillary Victory Fund, a joint operation with the \uc2 Democratic National Committee\uc2  and state parties, and one at a private home in New York City for the party's House campaign arm.\par \par \uc2 Find out what you need to know about the 2016 presidential race today, and get politics news updates via \uc2 Facebook\uc2 , \uc2 Twitter\uc2  and the First Draft newsletter.\par \par \uc2 President Obama, in Philadelphia on Tuesday, called Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  ''steady and true'' and said the race was not a ''reality show.''

\par\par \uc2 OP-ED COLUMNIST\par \uc2 Editorial Desk; SECTA\par \b \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2 's Putin Crush\b0\par\par\uc2 By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN \par \uc2 957 \uc2 words\par \uc2 14 September 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 27\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 When it comes to rebutting \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2 's idiotic observation that \uc2 Vladimir Putin\uc2  is a strong leader -- ''far more than our president has been a leader'' -- it is hard to top the assessment of Russian-born Garry Kasparov, the former world chess champion, which The Times's Andrew Higgins quoted in his story from Moscow: ''\uc2 Vladimir Putin\uc2  is a strong leader in the same way that arsenic is a strong drink. Praising a brutal K.G.B. dictator, especially as preferable to a democratically elected U.S. president, whether you like Obama or hate him, is despicable and dangerous.''\par \par \uc2 Indeed, Kasparov's point cuts to the core of what is so scary about a \uc2 Trump\uc2  presidency: \uc2 Trump\uc2  is what The Economist has called ''the leading exponent of 'post-truth' politics -- a reliance on assertions that 'feel true' but have no basis in fact,'' and, sadly, ''his brazenness is not punished, but taken as evidence of his willingness to stand up to elite power.'' When politics becomes ''like pro-wrestling,'' society pays a huge cost, The Economist added, because any complex explanation of any problem is dismissed as experts just trying ''to bamboozle everyone else.''\par \par \uc2 So \uc2 Trump\uc2  just skips from blaming Mexican immigrants for high murder rates, to President Obama for inventing ISIS, to China for creating the concept of global warming, to thousands of Muslims in New Jersey for celebrating 9/11, to Obama for really having been born in Kenya, to an I.R.S. audit for preventing him from showing us his tax returns -- which would probably show that he paid no taxes.\par \par \uc2 Every word of it is a lie that most in his own party won't call out. Can you imagine the damage \uc2 Trump\uc2  could do to the fabric of our democracy if he had the White House pulpit from which to preach his post-truth politics -- how it would filter down into public discourse at large and infect every policy debate?\par \par \uc2 ''\uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  has not only brought haters into the mainstream, he has normalized hate for a much broader swathe of the population who were perhaps already disaffected but had their grievances and latent prejudices held in check by social norms,'' observed Josh Marshall, publisher of TalkingPointsMemo.com, in his blog on Saturday. ''This isn't some minor point or critique. It's a fundamental part of what is at stake in this \uc2 election\uc2 , what makes it different from Obama v. Romney. ... This \uc2 election\uc2  has become a battle to combat the moral and civic cancer \uc2 Trump\uc2  has [been] injecting into the body politic.''\par \par \uc2 Think about the ridiculous trope \uc2 Trump\uc2  has been peddling, that if only Obama were as ''strong'' as Putin. Well, if he were, here are some of the benefits America would enjoy:\par \par \uc2 A 2015 report in The Moscow Times noted that ''life expectancy in Russia has been growing several times slower than in the rest of the world for the past 20 years, according to a research by the U.S.-based \uc2 Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation\uc2 .'' That coincides almost exactly with Putin's leadership of the country. The article explained, ''During the period of 1990-2013 [life expectancy] only grew by 1.8 years in Russia, while the global average number increased by 6.2 years, pushing Russia out of the top 100 countries with the highest life expectancy and placing it in 108th position -- between Iraq and North Korea.''\par \par \uc2 Why don't we have a leader strong enough to slow gains in the life expectancy of an entire nation?\par \par \uc2 An investigation by the \uc2 World Anti-Doping Agency\uc2  released last summer found that Putin's Russia was operating a state-sponsored doping scheme for four years across the ''vast majority'' of Summer and Winter Olympic sports. According to a July 18, 2016, \uc2 BBC\uc2  report on the investigation, ''\uc2 Russia's sports ministry\uc2  'directed, controlled and oversaw' manipulation of urine samples provided by its athletes.'' Scores of Russian athletes were barred from the Rio Olympics as a result.\par \par \uc2 I get it: A weak president doesn't dare tamper with his Olympic athletes. A strong president dopes up his Summer and Winter Olympic teams for multiple Games.\par \par \uc2 Since Putin invaded Ukraine to shore up his faltering domestic popularity, and then got hit with Western economic sanctions, the dollar-ruble exchange rate has gone from around 36 rubles to the dollar to 65 rubles to the dollar. Russia's economic growth fell 3.7 percent in 2015, and the I.M.F. predicts it will fall 1 percent in 2016. Inflation in Russia doubled to 15.4 percent in 2015, compared with 7.8 percent in 2014. A \uc2 World Bank\uc2  report quoted by the \uc2 BBC\uc2  in April said ''the number of Russians living below the poverty line will grow at its fastest pace in more than 17 years in 2016.''\par \par \uc2 It takes a strong leader to shrink his currency by 50 percent, double inflation and vastly accelerate poverty in just two years. A weak leader could never do that.\par \par \uc2 Putin is a leader who is always looking for dignity in all the wrong places -- by investing in bullying wars, not in his own people; by jailing and likely poisoning his opponents; and by being so insecure that he just shut Russia's last independent polling firm after it indicated that many Russians may not vote in the coming parliamentary elections because, among other things, they think they're ''rigged.''\par \par \uc2 This is the man \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  admires more than our own president.\par \par \uc2 I invite you to follow me on Twitter (@tomfriedman).\par \par \uc2 Follow The \uc2 New York Times\uc2  Opinion section on \uc2 Facebook\uc2  and Twitter (@NYTopinion), and sign up for the Opinion Today newsletter.\par \par \uc2 Document NYTF000020160914ec9e0004l\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 A hacker who American intelligence officials believe has ties to the Russian government made public on Tuesday a second batch of documents suspected of having been stolen from the \uc2 Democratic National Committee\uc2 's computer system, leaving the organization rushing to contain damage or embarrassment less than two months before the presidential \uc2 election\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 The internal documents, which party officials were verifying for authenticity, were distributed at a cybersecurity conference in London.\par \par \uc2 The release was apparently the work of Guccifer 2.0, a self-identified Romanian hacker who claimed responsibility for publishing a trove of the committee's documents before the Democratic convention in July.\par \par \uc2 Donna Brazile, the interim chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee, blamed Russian espionage for the hack and said that foreign agents were trying to help \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , the Republican presidential nominee, be elected.\par \par \uc2 ''The D.N.C. is the victim of a crime: an illegal cyberattack by Russian state-sponsored agents who seek to harm the Democratic Party and progressive groups in an effort to influence the presidential \uc2 election\uc2 ,'' Ms. Brazile said in a statement. ''There's one person who stands to benefit from these criminal acts, and that's \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2 .''\par \par \uc2 The first batch of documents showed that party officials had favored \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  over Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont in the Democratic primary campaign, and their disclosure appeared to have been timed to sow discord before a unifying moment.\par \par \uc2 Ms. Brazile said that the committee had expected more documents to be released and that its legal team was working to determine whether they were real or forged.\par \par \uc2 The documents released Tuesday were not immediately as damaging as the first trove, and they proved difficult to access. \uc2 WikiLeaks\uc2 , the anti-secrecy platform, posted multiple messages on \uc2 Twitter\uc2  explaining how to download the documents after users struggled to do so. Initial reports suggested that they were old records related to the committee's donor outreach program.\par \par \uc2 Their release is likely to put more focus on Russia's efforts to meddle in the presidential \uc2 election\uc2 . American intelligence agencies and private investigators concluded in July that the hack was the work of the Russian government.\par \par \uc2 President \uc2 Vladimir V. Putin\uc2  of Russia denied involvement in the security breach in an interview with Bloomberg News this month, but he did describe it as a public service.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  has dismissed suggestions of Russian involvement, but he drew scorn this summer when he invited Russian hackers to track down missing emails from the private server Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  used as secretary of state.\par \par \uc2 While Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  laughed off his remark, the \uc2 Democratic National Committee\uc2  said Tuesday that the hacking was not a coincidence.\par \par \uc2 ''Not only has \uc2 Trump\uc2  embraced Putin, he publicly encouraged further Russian espionage to help his campaign,'' Ms. Brazile said, calling Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's statements ''dangerous, divisive and unprecedented.''\par \par \uc2 Find out what you need to know about the 2016 presidential race today, and get politics news updates via \uc2 Facebook\uc2 , \uc2 Twitter\uc2  and the First Draft newsletter.\par \par \uc2 Document NYTF000020160914ec9e0004b\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 CONGRESSIONAL MEMO\par \uc2 National Desk; SECTA\par \b \uc2 A G.O.P. Fear in the House: Cooperation After Nov. 8\b0\par\par\uc2 By JENNIFER STEINHAUER \par \uc2 1,160 \uc2 words\par \uc2 14 September 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 12\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 WASHINGTON -- A big conspiracy theory in Washington these days, perhaps second only to the one concerning \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's supposed body double, is the fear among some House Republicans of what President Obama and their party leaders might cook up during a lame-duck session of Congress after \uc2 Election\uc2  Day.\par \par \uc2 They dread sudden approval of the Trans-Pacific Partnership. They worry about a sweeping bill that would fully fund the federal government. Some even fret that Judge \uc2 Merrick B. Garland\uc2  could be confirmed to the Supreme Court.\par \par \uc2 In short, they fear Congress functioning in a conventional, bipartisan way.\par \par \uc2 So some more conservative House Republicans are pushing for a long-term spending bill -- one that could very likely work against their interests next year -- to avoid returning to Washington in late November.\par \par \uc2 ''In lame ducks, all the rules seem to get muddled,'' said Representative Paul Gosar of Arizona, a Republican who counts himself among the lame-duck loathers. ''Legacy items run to the front of the line.''\par \par \uc2 The angst is not without merit. Serious legislation and political altercations have occurred in the 19 lame-duck sessions held by Congress since 1940, including the censure of Senator Joseph R. McCarthy; a gas tax increase; a huge and contentious land preservation measure; and, in 2010, a vote to overturn a 17-year ban on gays and lesbians serving openly in the military.\par \par \uc2 But the panic among Republicans that they will be betrayed by their party also demonstrates a profound gulf of trust between many rank-and-file members and congressional leaders that has fermented over the last six years, as well as a frustration that their party has been unable to curtail the power of the executive branch.\par \par \uc2 ''I do think it shows a lack of trust,'' said former Senator Trent Lott of Mississippi, a Republican, who tried repeatedly and in vain to stop lame-duck sessions while in Congress and who likened members of the newest group of opposition to fleshy, wattled fowl. ''But I also think it shows a lack of understanding reality. I was conservative before most of these turkeys were born.''\par \par \uc2 Members of the hard-right Freedom Caucus, who are pushing for a spending bill that goes beyond Dec. 9, are trying hard to make their case to Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin, the House speaker, even as their arguments lay bare their distrust of his promises.\par \par \uc2 They insist that scores of members who are retiring or who are likely to lose their seats in the November \uc2 election\uc2  should not be permitted to weigh in on big policy matters.\par \par \uc2 ''During the time between the \uc2 election\uc2  and the next Congress, perhaps as many as 20 percent of those voting in Congress will have lost their jobs, either voluntarily or involuntarily,'' said Representative Mick Mulvaney of South Carolina, a Republican. ''It doesn't make sense, when the body is populated in such a fashion, to make final decisions on critical issues.''\par \par \uc2 Some House Republicans also fear a large spending bill, known as an omnibus, that would replace appropriations measures to fund the government, possibly at levels far higher than current spending. ''What's going to happen is they're going to come back in the lame-duck session and plus up spending,'' said Representative Thomas Massie, Republican of Kentucky.\par \par \uc2 Lame-duck sessions can indeed be vehicles for omnibus spending bills. However, the House Republicans who despise those bills are the same ones who have voted down individual appropriations measures or helped load them up with policy riders that contributed to their failure on the House floor. This has made omnibus and short-term broad spending bills hard to avoid, short of a government shutdown. And, notably, Mr. Ryan has repeatedly rejected the idea of an omnibus.\par \par \uc2 There is also fear that a trade bill, which has tenuous support in both chambers and which Mr. Obama greatly desires, would sail through Congress. ''Both presidential candidates say they are against the trade bill,'' Mr. Gosar said. ''In that sense, it's perfect timing for them to do it in lame duck.''\par \par \uc2 On Tuesday, Max Baucus, the ambassador to China and a former Democratic senator from Montana, was on Capitol Hill to make a final pitch for the trade deal, showing that there was still interest in passage this year.\par \par \uc2 It would be virtually impossible for a lame-duck Congress to approve the Pacific trade accord, the largest regional trade deal in history. The ''fast-track'' trade negotiating law that helped Mr. Obama complete the accord requires hurdles Congress must clear before a final up-or-down vote on any trade deal, including hearings, a public drafting of legislation, and a full debate and vote in both chambers.\par \par \uc2 For that process to conclude this year, congressional leaders would almost certainly have to hold the first hearings, at least, before \uc2 Election\uc2  Day. ''I don't think the predicate has been laid,'' said Mr. Lott, who supports the measure. ''That would be a mistake.''\par \par \uc2 Senate Republicans are eager to cut a short-term spending deal that would authorize new funds to combat the Zika virus and fund veterans programs, hoping to pass it by the middle of next week and return to the campaign trail. The approach has ample bipartisan appeal.\par \par \uc2 But barring their own plan for a long-term deal, House Republicans want something in return. ''Let's get something for it,'' said Representative Jeff Duncan, Republican of South Carolina, who mentioned a policy provision he would like attached to a bill that would halt the Obama administration's Syrian refugee program and said he was seeking support from the Senate on a possible impeachment of \uc2 John Koskinen\uc2 , the commissioner of the Internal Revenue Service.\par \par \uc2 As expected, Democrats say, ''No, thanks.'' ''If Republican leadership starts giving in to one demand from the hard right, there will be another and then another,'' said Senator \uc2 Chuck Schumer\uc2 , Democrat of New York. ''The only way this is going to get done is if Republican leadership bucks the hard right, period.''\par \par \uc2 A spending bill that bleeds into next year would give more power to the White House and the next Congress, which could be at least partly controlled by Democrats, so it is against the interest of the very people clamoring for it.\par \par \uc2 ''I do think that ending up with an omnibus at the end of every year makes people cynical,'' said Senator John Thune, Republican of South Dakota. ''But in terms of any nefarious attempts to cut deals, I don't think anyone should fear that. It's not going to happen.''\par \par \uc2 Follow The \uc2 New York Times\uc2 's politics and Washington coverage on \uc2 Facebook\uc2  and \uc2 Twitter\uc2 , and sign up for the First Draft politics newsletter.\par \par \uc2 From left, Senators John Barrasso; John Thune; Mitch McConnell, the majority leader; and John Cornyn, the majority whip.

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 For much of the summer, \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  deliberately kept a low public profile, fund-raising in private and pursuing a hands-off campaign strategy: If \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2  wanted to seize center stage by picking unpopular fights -- with a Gold Star father, a federal judge, the leaders of his own party -- she would not stand in his way.\par \par \uc2 Now, sidelined with pneumonia just as she hoped to reintroduce herself with a series of more personal policy speeches, Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  has left herself uniquely vulnerable to an unplanned absence.\par \par \uc2 Her dismal public standing on questions of candor, combined with decades of conspiracy theories about her health, had already produced an uncommon challenge for aides and supporters seeking to tamp down speculation about her physical condition.\par \par \uc2 More substantively, among Democrats worried that Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  has failed to make a more forceful case for her candidacy since the party's convention, her illness has reinforced the danger of a \uc2 Trump\uc2 -centric strategy -- leaving the \uc2 Clinton\uc2  side without a memorable affirmative message to hammer home, especially when its chief messenger is on the mend.\par \par \uc2 The focus on Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  has done little to remedy Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's trust deficit with voters. And despite volumes of policy proposals, even \uc2 Clinton\uc2  supporters often strain to identify cohesive themes, independent of Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , in her campaign.\par \par \uc2 Aides said last week that she planned to give several speeches aimed at connecting her personal motivations to her political agenda. The second in the series, slated for Tuesday, was postponed after she fell ill.\par \par \uc2 ''They've clearly framed the race as a referendum on \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2 ,'' said Steve McMahon, a longtime Democratic strategist. ''That does create a vacuum and a greater level of interest in things like this that, frankly, probably have no special significance.''\par \par \uc2 In recent days, with the \uc2 election\uc2  nearing its final stretch, Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  had shown signs of more openness after months of encouragement from advisers to hold more news conferences, sit for more interviews and brandish the dry charm they have encountered in private. Last week, she brought out a new campaign plane with room for reporters to fly with her and stood for extended questions from her traveling press corps, for the first time in several months, without major incident.\par \par \uc2 The campaign also introduced a new advertisement, a largely positive spot focused on Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's history of working with Republicans. She is seated, speaking directly to the camera, evoking a biographical video from the Democratic National Convention in July that highlighted her career accomplishments and compassion.\par \par \uc2 ''They're going back to that part of the convention that got lost in the month of August,'' said Bob Shrum, a veteran Democratic adviser and strategist.\par \par \uc2 Brian Fallon, a campaign spokesman, said that Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  would continue her speech tour once she returned to full health, with addresses focused on ''an inclusive economy,'' ''a call to national service'' and ''a vision for how we should prioritize the condition of kids and families.''\par \par \uc2 ''We're going to pick up right where we left off in terms of sparking a conversation about her aspirational vision for the country,'' Mr. Fallon said in an interview. ''I think that that will be far more enduring in the course of this campaign than this brief focus on this case of pneumonia.''\par \par \uc2 But the diagnosis has proved particularly ill timed, not least because of recent ominous insinuations from Republicans, including Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , that Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's health was faltering.\par \par \uc2 In the past, she has tried to deflect questions with humor, opening a jar of pickles to demonstrate her vitality on ''Jimmy Kimmel Live'' last month and asking the host to take her pulse. This time, there has been no such attempt at levity.\par \par \uc2 Her campaign's handling of the episode has also exacerbated an impression that she is overly guarded, a trait that \uc2 Clinton\uc2  allies have long attributed to an endless feedback loop: She retreats to secrecy because she distrusts the news media, they say, creating a sense that there is something to hide, which makes reporters more wary.\par \par \uc2 ''The past impressions of \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  help fuel the questions about being transparent about her health,'' said Joe Trippi, a Democratic operative who helped steer campaigns for Howard Dean and \uc2 Richard A. Gephardt\uc2 , among others. ''No one would have asked them of Dick Gephardt.''\par \par \uc2 Still, in this particular instance, Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's team has acknowledged some regrets. After she abruptly left a ceremony for the 15th anniversary of the Sept. 11 attacks, her campaign did not disclose her whereabouts for more than an hour.\par \par \uc2 Several hours later, aides announced that she had received a diagnosis of pneumonia -- two days earlier.\par \par \uc2 On Monday, staff members were determined to take the blame for the secrecy and to shield Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  from the criticism.\par \par \uc2 ''We could have done better,'' Jennifer Palmieri, Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's communications director, wrote on \uc2 Twitter\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 ''That's on the staff,'' Mr. Fallon told MSNBC.\par \par \uc2 ''That's on us,'' Robby Mook, her campaign manager, later told the network.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Mook was referring to the gap between Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's departure from the memorial and the campaign's announcement of what had happened. Some supporters, though, suggested that even more disclosure was necessary.\par \par \uc2 ''I would have, on the initial diagnosis, made that public,'' said Edward G. Rendell, a former governor of Pennsylvania. ''They're probably a little bit gun-shy.''\par \par \uc2 Mr. Fallon said there was never ''an intent to conceal the diagnosis'' and speculated that Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  might have told the traveling press corps about it on her own this week, had she not become overheated at the memorial on Sunday and changed her travel schedule.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Rendell echoed several other Democrats who predicted that the episode would be largely forgotten if Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  returned to the campaign trail soon, especially if she delivers a commanding performance at the first presidential debate in two weeks.\par \par \uc2 But after a trying summer for Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , during which he seemed to set off controversy almost daily, he has displayed something approaching self-discipline in recent days. He has often focused on Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's remark at a fund-raiser last week that half of his supporters belonged in a ''basket of deplorables.''\par \par \uc2 The events over the weekend heightened Democrats' anxiety about a race some had thought would effectively be over by now, given Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's historic unfavorable ratings and the Democrats' built-in advantages on the electoral map.\par \par \uc2 Dan Pfeiffer, a former top adviser to President Obama, preached calm. He said that while ''the last couple of days could have gone better,'' the main cost to the \uc2 Clinton\uc2  campaign had been ''playing defense instead of offense'' while parrying questions about her health.\par \par \uc2 ''That is less of a problem because she is winning,'' Mr. Pfeiffer said, citing Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's continued advantage in polls, though some have shown a tightening race. ''Every day the race doesn't move is a win for her. \uc2 Trump\uc2  can't afford to trade baskets at this point.''\par \par \uc2 Find out what you need to know about the 2016 presidential race today, and get politics news updates via \uc2 Facebook\uc2 , \uc2 Twitter\uc2  and the First Draft newsletter.\par \par \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  in White Plains last week.

\par\par \uc2 ABROAD IN AMERICA\par \uc2 Foreign Desk; SECT\par \b \uc2 Fearful and Flummoxed: Watching the Presidential Race From Abroad\b0\par\par\uc2 By DECLAN WALSH \par \uc2 1,209 \uc2 words\par \uc2 14 September 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 The New York Times on the Web\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 They feel invested in this American presidential race, like no \uc2 election\uc2  before, and fret about its outcome -- even if, for the most part, they don't have a vote.\par \par \uc2 A current of helpless anxiety runs through hundreds of emails and \uc2 Facebook\uc2  posts from \uc2 New York Times\uc2  readers around the world since I arrived here in July to help cover the helter-skelter presidential \uc2 election\uc2 , now hurtling down its homestretch. Among foreigners, it boils down to a single question: How did it come to this?\par \par \uc2 ''In one of the most mature democracies in the world, how does a campaign get so wild?'' asked Manu Duggar, a Nepali living in Canada. ''I'm afraid,'' said Bernt Klein, a computer scientist in Germany.\par \par \uc2 Overwhelmingly, international readers say they are transfixed by the unorthodox candidacy of \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , the Republican candidate, and confounded by the strong emotions that \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  evokes among many Americans, including Democrats.\par \par \uc2 Many see Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's campaign as an extension of the political tides that have buffeted their own countries. The French see shades of the hard-right nationalist Marine Le Pen. Britons see parallels with supporters of Brexit, the decision to leave the \uc2 European Union\uc2 . Arabs draw comparisons with popular support for strongman nationalists.\par \par \uc2 ''What we Europeans, especially Italians, cannot understand is how the party of Lincoln and Eisenhower has declined so deep and fast toward \uc2 Trump\uc2 ,'' said David Cerri, an Italian lawyer. Sure, he conceded, Italians elected \uc2 Silvio Berlusconi\uc2 . ''But frankly he's not been a danger for democracy so conspicuous as Donald.''\par \par \uc2 America's neighbors are just as baffled. Sharon Campbell, a self-described ''nervous Canadian,'' fears a victory for Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  on Nov. 8 would portend serious disruption between the two countries. ''Treaties torn up, alliances ended, currency exchange proscribed, trade agreements abrogated and movement of people and goods between the borders of Canada and the U.S. at risk. That's for starters. Wow!'' she wrote.\par \par \uc2 American readers, intrigued to know what a foreigner makes of their country in this strange political moment, offered voluminous advice and urgent invitations to visit. Go to the border towns of the Southwest, they said, or to the back streets of Baltimore, or to the Midwestern heartland.\par \par \uc2 Come to Texas, wrote Diann Nicols, ''to see what America looked like in the 1950s when the good ole boys talked politics after dinner and the womenfolk retired to the parlor to talk about recipes and household tips.''\par \par \uc2 A curveball \uc2 election\uc2  has thrown up curveball queries. For some, the extreme nature of the campaign rhetoric -- which is already thick with insults and grumbles about possible vote rigging -- raises questions about American law, during the \uc2 election\uc2  and beyond.\par \par \uc2 Will foreign \uc2 election\uc2  observers be deployed to monitor the vote, much as they do in elections in other countries?\par \par \uc2 Given the president's power to launch a nuclear strike, is there a legal entity that monitors his or her mental capacity?\par \par \uc2 ''Can anyone restrain a president who is obviously not fit?'' asked Ken Martin, a retired government official from New Zealand.\par \par \uc2 And what would happen if Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  won the \uc2 election\uc2  but was assassinated before she was sworn in?\par \par \uc2 That last question, submitted by Hank Gehman, seems extreme. But it stemmed from the moment in August when Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  suggested that gun rights advocates might take matters into their own hands if Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  won.\par \par \uc2 (Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  later said his comment had been made in jest.)\par \par \uc2 For answers I turned to James A. Thurber, a professor of political science at \uc2 American University in Washington\uc2 , who has just returned from a trip to Russia, Turkey and several other European countries where he said he had fielded similar questions from concerned foreign observers.\par \par \uc2 International observers will be present in November, just as they have been in past American elections, Dr. Thurber said. Their goal is to learn, not to lecture. ''They don't come to look for fraud, but to take lessons from how we administer the \uc2 election\uc2 ,'' he said.\par \par \uc2 The job of monitoring the vote falls largely to Democrat and Republican \uc2 election\uc2  monitors who will be present at polling places across the country.\par \par \uc2 American law has no specific provisions for the death of a president-elect, Dr. Thurber said. The most likely outcome would be for the winning party to choose its vice-presidential running mate to step up. ''The people would have spoken for the ticket,'' he said.\par \par \uc2 Similarly, there is no legal authority for oversight of the president's mental capacity -- determining fitness to hold office is a major purpose of the campaign. But it is a timely query.\par \par \uc2 Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , 68, and Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , 70, have produced doctor's letters to attest their good health, but have provided less information about their health than any previous candidate in recent decades. On Sunday, Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  grew weak as she abruptly left a ceremony in New York. Her campaign acknowledged that she had been given a diagnosis of pneumonia two days earlier -- an acknowledgment that stoked worries about Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's transparency as well as her health.\par \par \uc2 The letter from Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's doctor, which made a number of unfounded assertions about his health, later turned out to have been dashed off in less than five minutes.\par \par \uc2 Once in office, a president can be replaced only if he or she is convicted by the Senate, after articles of impeachment are issued by the House of Representatives, or is incapacitated. Short of that, Dr. Thurber added, the phalanx of military and civilian advisers around the president might informally restrain him from making certain rash decisions. At the end of Ronald Reagan's administration, Dr. Thurber said, ''lots of people around him guided him and persuaded him.''\par \par \uc2 ''It would be a similar situation,'' he added, should Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  or Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  demonstrate they lack the fitness to make decisions.\par \par \uc2 The biggest mystery for many abroad, though, relates to Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , and the intense emotions she elicits among so many Americans. ''The bit I don't get is the antipathy towards Hillary,'' wrote Stephen Woodmansee, an Australian living in Malaysia. ''Why is she so widely distrusted (hated even)? Is it pure misogyny or am I missing something?''\par \par \uc2 ''From our perspective she's an imperfect politician (aren't they all?) but has a very good record of getting things done,'' wrote Kim Glasgow.\par \par \uc2 I can see where they are coming from: During the Labor Day holiday this month, I visited my relatives in New Jersey, many of whom are staunch Republicans. At the dinner table, just the mention of Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  provoked a barrage of sharp criticism that echoed attack lines often heard on Fox News about her being a criminal.\par \par \uc2 But Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  is also a divisive figure among Democrats -- her unfavorable ratings among registered voters is the worst for a front-runner in any modern \uc2 election\uc2 . I've noticed that, to animate any barroom conversation, you just have to mention her name. It's like rolling a grenade under the table, which makes me think it might be a good subject to examine in the coming weeks.\par \par \uc2 Follow Declan Walsh on Instagram @declanjwalsh and on Twitter @declanwalsh .\par \par \uc2 Document NYTF000020160914ec9e0003f\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 To the Editor:\par \par \uc2 Re ''The Selling of Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2 '' (Op-Ed, Sept. 10):\par \par \uc2 Lee Siegel is right that Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  is pushing himself as a product, not a politician. This is what he does, masterfully. It works because we have more experience as consumers of products and advertising than as students of history and facts.\par \par \uc2 The division between Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's non-college-educated white men and \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's credentialed, affluent women reflects this. Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's style and success as a huckster and Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's ''teacher knows best'' persona polarize this division.\par \par \uc2 The real message (and tragedy) of the 2016 \uc2 election\uc2  is that the \uc2 Trump\uc2  phenomenon demonstrates the transformation of politics (and democracy) by money and advertising, which have not only captured the media but also, sadly, an alarming portion of the American mind.\par \par \uc2 WALT GLAZER\par \par \uc2 Sagamore Hills, Ohio\par \par \uc2 The writer is a retired historian.\par \par \uc2 Document NYTF000020160914ec9e0003b\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw272\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4080\pichgoal600

\par\par \b \uc2 Niou Wins Assembly Primary\b0\par\par\uc2 By Mike Vilensky   \par \uc2 947 \uc2 words\par \uc2 14 September 2016\par \uc2 The Wall Street Journal\par \uc2 J\par A17\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 In former New York state Assembly Speaker \uc2 Sheldon Silver\uc2 's onetime district, a critic is poised to succeed him over an ally.\par \par \uc2 Former Assembly aide Yuh-Line Niou won the Democratic nomination to represent lower Manhattan on Tuesday over her longtime rival, incumbent Assemblywoman Alice Cancel, who succeeded Mr. Silver after he was convicted of public-corruption charges. Ms. Cancel had the backing of Mr. Silver's supporters.\par \par \uc2 In a high-profile Senate race in Manhattan, Marisol Alcantara won a four-way Democratic primary for an open seat representing much of the borough's West Side, according to preliminary returns.\par \par \uc2 Ms. Niou had 32% of the vote in the Assembly contest. In the six-person race for the lower Manhattan district, Ms. Cancel, who won a special \uc2 election\uc2  in April to succeed Mr. Silver, had 12.4% of the vote.\par \par \uc2 "It took us two times, but we did it," said Ms. Niou, adding she was humbled to be the first Asian-American to represent Chinatown in the Legislature. "We stood up to the political bosses and we won."\par \par \uc2 Ms. Cancel said she was disappointed with the outcome but pledged to "never stop fighting to improve the quality-of-life of the community."\par \par \uc2 Ms. Cancel's loss marks an unusual blow for an incumbent legislator in Albany, reflecting calls for change in the area after Mr. Silver's allies backed her earlier this year in the special \uc2 election\uc2 . Ms. Niou unsuccessfully ran against Ms. Cancel on the \uc2 Working Families Party\uc2  line in April.\par \par \uc2 Lower East Side voter Lisa Polen, 43 years old, voted for Gigi Li, who lost, but said earlier Tuesday she didn't vote for Ms. Cancel because "I'm looking for change -- someone who was not part of the \uc2 Sheldon Silver\uc2  experience."\par \par \uc2 The district is heavily Democratic and Ms. Niou is expected to cruise to victory in the Nov. 8 general \uc2 election\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 The primary race in the 65th Assembly District was one of the most closely watched contests on Tuesday. There were dozens of other contested primaries for the Legislature's 213 seats, and early returns showed incumbents winning most of them.\par \par \uc2 In November, every seat in the Legislature is up for grabs in an \uc2 election\uc2  that could shift which party holds power in the Senate. Democrats hold a razor-thin majority but Republicans control the chamber because they are allied with six Democrats who have splintered from their party's conference in Albany.\par \par \uc2 With 95% of precincts reporting in the Senate primary, Ms. Alcantara had 35% of the vote. Ms. Alcantara is seeking to succeed Sen. Adriano Espaillat, a Democrat who won a primary last June to succeed longtime \uc2 Rep. Charles Rangel\uc2 , who is retiring.\par \par \uc2 Ms. Alcantara, a union organizer, had been endorsed by Mr. Espaillat, and her win over two candidates who appeared to have institutional advantages over her was a boost to Mr. Espaillat's reputation as a political power broker.\par \par \uc2 At a victory party, Ms. Alcantara walked on stage with Mr. Espaillat to roaring applause. Many in the crowd chanted in Spanish, "Women taking power!"\par \par \uc2 "The Senate needed a little bit of spice and they needed a dose of immigrant," Ms. Alcantara said.\par \par \uc2 Her chief competitors were Micah Lasher, a former aide to the New York attorney general, and Robert Jackson, a former city councilman who is close to teachers unions.\par \par \uc2 Ms. Alcantara's win gives the Independent Democratic Conference a new member, a boon to Republicans who have been aligned with the conference to maintain control of the chamber.\par \par \uc2 Ms. Alcantara had positioned herself in the race as the most in-touch with working-class constituents and has touted her Dominican roots. She is the only major candidate in the primary who supported Bernie Sanders for president over \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Assemblywoman Margaret Markey, a Queens Democrat, lost her party's nomination to Brian Barnwell, an activist in the borough. Assemblyman Guillermo Linares, a Manhattan Democrat, lost his primary to Carmen De La Rosa, a district leader in upper Manhattan and another ally of Mr. Espaillat's.\par \par \uc2 Sen. Gustavo Rivera, a Bronx Democrat, fended off a primary challenge from Councilman Fernando Cabrera. He had more than 60% of the vote, according to early returns. Assemblywoman Latrice Walker, a Brooklyn Democrat, won her party's nomination over challenger Councilwoman Darlene Mealy with about 75% of the vote.\par \par \uc2 Meanwhile, in the Rochester area, a dead Republican legislator, Assemblyman Bill Nojay, was leading in his primary with about 59% of the vote. Local leaders had encouraged Republicans to vote for Mr. Nojay, who remains on the ballot, over Rick Milne, the mayor of the village of Honeoye Falls.\par \par \uc2 If Mr. Nojay is declared the winner, the Republican leaders of the three counties Mr. Nojay represented will have the power to replace him on the ballot ahead of the general \uc2 election\uc2  in a largely Republican district.\par \par \uc2 In New York City, Councilman Rafael Salamanca Jr., a Bronx Democrat, won his party's nomination in his bid for re-\uc2 election\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Mr. Salamanca won the seat in a special \uc2 election\uc2  earlier this year.\par \par \uc2 Asian-Americans at Ms. Niou's victory party were hailing her nomination as a historic win. "I enjoy this moment because it's a long time coming," said Virginia Kee, 84 years old and a longtime leader in the community.\par \par \uc2 Chung Seto, a senior adviser to Ms. Niou's campaign, said a diverse coalition of support led to the victory.\par \par \uc2 "It's historic for us," Ms. Seto said. "We waited 40 years for our own representative."\par \par \uc2 ---\par \par \uc2 Mara Gay, Sonja Sharp, Thomas MacMillan and Zolan Kanno-Youngs contributed to this article.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=wjco20160914000140"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document J000000020160914ec9e00041\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw272\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4080\pichgoal600

\par\par \b \uc2 Election\uc2  2016: \uc2 Trump\uc2  Lays Out Child-Care Proposal --- Republican wants rebates for low-income families; \uc2 Clinton\uc2  camp sees skew to wealthy\b0\par\par\uc2 By Janet Hook and Richard Rubin   \par \uc2 663 \uc2 words\par \uc2 14 September 2016\par \uc2 The Wall Street Journal\par \uc2 J\par A6\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 ASTON, Pa. -- \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  proposed new federal subsidies for child care, including tax deductions, rebates for lower-income households and tax-preferred savings accounts, as well as a promise of paid maternity leave for workers who don't have it.\par \par \uc2 The proposal is the latest move by the Republican presidential nominee to build up a policy agenda that has been short on detail. The child-care proposal could help Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  appeal to blocs of voters who have resisted him, like women and swing voters who dominate the Philadelphia suburbs, even as it contravenes parts of GOP orthodoxy on tax and social policy.\par \par \uc2 "We're about solutions," said Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , setting a very different tone from his massive rallies as he presented the child care proposal to a small audience at a community center here in a measured, scripted policy speech. "Right now, our politicians have locked our country into endless fights about small and petty things."\par \par \uc2 The plan fleshes out and broadens the general idea Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  brought up in an economic policy speech in Detroit in early August, when he said he wanted to offer tax deductions for child-care expenses.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  was accompanied by his daughter Ivanka, who helped craft the proposal. Introducing her father, Ms. \uc2 Trump\uc2  said she considered it a top priority for her father's presidency to improve a child-care system that was "too expensive, too outdated and too inaccessible."\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's proposal calls for allowing taxpayers -- both those who take the standard deduction and those who itemize deductions -- to deduct child-care expenses up to an amount equal to the average cost of care in their state. The deduction wouldn't be available to individuals earning more than $250,000, or couples earning $500,000.\par \par \uc2 The proposal also calls for six weeks of paid maternity leave through unemployment benefits to parents whose employers don't offer it now. Republicans have long resisted the idea of having the U.S. emulate other countries' paid- leave programs, warning about budgetary costs and government mandates. The \uc2 Trump\uc2  campaign said the cost -- roughly $2.5 billion a year, according to a senior aide -- would be offset by reducing waste and abuse in the unemployment insurance program.\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 Trump\uc2  proposal also would offer "spending rebates" up to $1,200 a year to lower-income families through the Earned Income Tax Credit.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  also calls for a new savings account for families to save for caring for their children or elderly parents.\par \par \uc2 Jacob Leibenluft, a senior policy adviser to the \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  campaign, told reporters Tuesday that some low-income families would get a relatively small fraction of their costs covered under Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's plan because the tax deduction for child care could only offset income taxes and a portion of payroll taxes.\par \par \uc2 Higher-income households, meanwhile, could save significantly on private-school tuition through the new savings account, he said.\par \par \uc2 Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  has proposed limiting child-care costs to 10% of a family's income but has offered few details. She called for universal access to preschool education, increased federal subsidies and tax breaks for child-care costs, a program to promote raises for child-care workers, higher spending on Early Head Start, and scholarships for college students with children.\par \par \uc2 Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  has also proposed guaranteeing workers up to 12 weeks of paid family and medical leave. Her plan would specify such workers get at least two-thirds of their regular wage, up to a ceiling.\par \par \uc2 A \uc2 Trump\uc2  campaign aide couldn't say how much revenue the tax breaks would cost. He said that it would be part of Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's broader tax overhaul and economic policy. He said the goal was for the entire package to be deficit-neutral.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=wjco20160914000132"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document J000000020160914ec9e0003t\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw272\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4080\pichgoal600

They invoked their Fifth Amendment right against testifying before the Republican-led House Oversight and Government Reform committee. Another technology staffer unaffiliated with the company, Bryan Pagliano, defied a congressional subpoena and declined to attend Tuesday's hearing.\par \par \uc2 A spokesman for Platte River Networks, which helped manage Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's server, declined to comment other than to say the company would be issuing a statement in the near future. An attorney representing Mr. Pagliano didn't respond to a request for comment.\par \par \uc2 The standoff in front of the committee is the latest episode in the saga over Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's use of a private email server while heading the State Department between 2009 and 2013.\par \par \uc2 -- Byron Tau\par \par \uc2 ---\par \par \uc2 NEW YORK\par \par \uc2 State AG to Probe\par \par \uc2 Trump\uc2  Foundation\par \par \uc2 New York state Attorney General Eric Schneiderman has opened an inquiry into the Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2  Foundation "based on troubling transactions," according to a person familiar with the matter.\par \par \uc2 The person familiar said Tuesday that the office was concerned about several transactions, the same day Mr. Schneiderman, a Democrat, said on \uc2 CNN\uc2  he was looking into the \uc2 Trump\uc2  Foundation.\par \par \uc2 The person familiar with the matter declined to specify the nature of the transactions that were under review.\par \par \uc2 A spokesman for the \uc2 Trump\uc2  campaign called Mr. Schneiderman "a partisan hack." "This is nothing more than another left-wing hit job designed to distract from Crooked \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's disastrous week," said Jason Miller, senior communications adviser for Mr. \uc2
