\par\par \b \uc2 Democrats In Albany Skeptical Of Cuomo\b0\par\par\uc2 By Mike Vilensky and Erica Orden   \par \uc2 810 \uc2 words\par \uc2 26 July 2016\par \uc2 The Wall Street Journal\par \uc2 J\par A17\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 In the 2014 \uc2 election\uc2  cycle, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo sparked criticism from Democrats who said he did little to help his own party gain control of the state Senate. Two years later, some say times haven't changed.\par \par \uc2 "The governor wants what the governor wants," shrugged Sen. Ruben Diaz of the Bronx, who identifies as a conservative Democrat, when asked which party he thought Mr. Cuomo wants to be in charge of the Senate.\par \par \uc2 New York's Assembly is overwhelmingly Democratic, but the Senate is roughly split between Republicans and Democrats, and all of both chambers' seats are up this November.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Cuomo is set to be in Philadelphia this week for a speaking role at the Democratic National Convention in support of \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's presidential campaign. He showed less support for state Democrats earlier this month, saying it was too soon for a conversation about a Democratic Senate and that he was focused on Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's \uc2 election\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Those remarks drew a rebuke from the liberal \uc2 Working Families Party\uc2 , which said Mr. Cuomo "could not bring himself to support Democratic candidates."\par \par \uc2 In the aftermath of that dust-up, Mr. Cuomo said he would support Democrats.\par \par \uc2 Sen. Mike Gianaris, a Queens Democrat who serves as deputy leader of the Senate Democratic Conference, said he appreciated Mr. Cuomo "clarifying" his remarks, but that there was still room for the governor to help.\par \par \uc2 "Fundraising would be significant," Mr. Gianaris said. He added that after past elections, the Senate Democrats have learned to "provide for ourselves."\par \par \uc2 The Democratic housekeeping account Mr. Cuomo controls hasn't transferred money to Democratic Senate candidates since a special \uc2 election\uc2  this spring, and the governor hasn't endorsed or raised funds for any Democratic state legislators this summer.\par \par \uc2 His spokesman, Richard Azzopardi, said the governor "supports a Democratic Senate and looks forward to campaigning for them as \uc2 election\uc2  season ramps up."\par \par \uc2 Mr. Azzopardi pointed to endorsements Mr. Cuomo made in 2014 in support of Democrats.\par \par \uc2 Christine Quinn, vice chairwoman of the state Democratic Party and former speaker of the New York City Council, defended Mr. Cuomo in an interview Monday, saying he separated government and politics during the legislative season. "Make no doubt about it," she said, "the state Democratic committee is committed to all Democratic candidates."\par \par \uc2 Mr. Cuomo, who oversees that committee, has triggered these intraparty concerns before. He agreed in 2014 to push for a fully Democratic Legislature in exchange for an endorsement from the \uc2 Working Families Party\uc2 , but Republicans remained in power in the Senate.\par \par \uc2 "We're hopeful that this time he'll be all in," said Bill Lipton, director of the Working Families Party.\par \par \uc2 Since his re-\uc2 election\uc2 , Mr. Cuomo has sought to allay tensions with his party's left flank, but he has worked with Republicans this year to pass much of his Democratic agenda, including raising the minimum wage and establishing 12 weeks of paid family leave.\par \par \uc2 Political lobbyists, advisers and other operatives with ties to Mr. Cuomo said the state races create a conundrum for him, since he has worked closely with the GOP and touted his ability to ease partisan gridlock. Mr. Cuomo has also pinned some failures to pass liberal legislation on the GOP Senate.\par \par \uc2 "It's likely that he will get most of what he really wants with a Republican Senate," said Douglas Muzzio, a political scientist for the City University of New York.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Cuomo's work with Republicans extends to his staff. Last year, he hired a Senate Republican aide, \uc2 Robert Mujica\uc2 , as his budget director. This month, he hired the Republican Senate communications director, Kelly Cummings, as his senior adviser.\par \par \uc2 Bill Hyers, an ally of Democratic Mayor \uc2 Bill de Blasio\uc2  who managed his 2013 \uc2 election\uc2  campaign, criticized the moves, saying it would be one thing to keep government workers in clerical positions, but "large political appointees should reflect your values."\par \par \uc2 Mr. Azzopardi said Mr. Hyers is "just a political hack."\par \par \uc2 "Not sure who that even is," Mr. Hyers said in response. "Maybe someday he can work his way up to being a political hack."\par \par \uc2 Other governors have hired outside the party as well.\par \par \uc2 Former Gov. George Pataki, a Republican, recalled having a Democrat, Jim McGuire, serve as his counsel. In an interview, Mr. Pataki said partisan fights within administrations are unusual, even when an executive hires outside the party.\par \par \uc2 "You're the executive," Mr. Pataki said. "If they don't agree with your idea, they're gone."\par \par \uc2 Mr. Cuomo's Republican staffers could be useful to him, Ms. Quinn said. "If you have to spend a lot of your time basically working with Republicans and getting Republicans to move on your agenda, it might be useful to have someone who speaks their language."\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=wjco20160726000070"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document J000000020160726ec7q00057\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw272\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4080\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 Heard on the Street\par \b \uc2 Party Roles Need a Reassessment\b0\par\par\uc2 By Justin Lahart   \par \uc2 523 \uc2 words\par \uc2 26 July 2016\par \uc2 The Wall Street Journal\par \uc2 J\par C8\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 [Financial Analysis and Commentary]\par \par \uc2 One cornerstone of U.S. politics has been that Republicans treat investors and big businesses better than Democrats do. In the current campaign, that assumption needs updating.\par \par \uc2 In many areas such as bank regulation, the minimum wage and the environment, Republicans still are the kindlier party, but the differences are subtler. And on trade and immigration, the Democrats under \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  have become the more business-friendly party.\par \par \uc2 The platform that the Democratic Party was poised to adopt on Monday took an even harder line on Wall Street than the Republican platform, with its surprising promise to reinstate the 1933 Glass-Steagall Act. It isn't a surprise that the Democrats' new platform also calls for a new version of the Glass-Steagall, which separated investment and commercial banking.\par \par \uc2 The Democrats, though, also promised to "vigorously implement, enforce, and build on" the Dodd-Frank law -- the postcrisis regulatory overhaul that imposed new requirements and rules on banks. The Republicans have vowed to overturn Dodd-Frank.\par \par \uc2 So while Wall Street might chafe under the Republican platform, the Democratic platform would be harsher. The biggest impact would be on regional and community banks, which would be largely unaffected by a Glass-Steagall reinstatement but have been more tightly regulated under Dodd-Frank. For them, the Republican platform is friendlier.\par \par \uc2 The Democratic platform also says that "Americans should earn at least $15 an hour," and the subminimum wages for tipped workers should be abolished. That would impose higher labor costs on businesses that rely on low-wage workers, particularly restaurants. And it calls for tougher rules on the environment, which would hurt oil and gas producers.\par \par \uc2 The old playbook goes out the window on trade. \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  has vowed to halt the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade agreement between the U.S. and Pacific Rim countries, and over the weekend threatened to pull the U.S. out of the \uc2 World Trade Organization\uc2  if his plan to impose penalties on companies that move American production offshore is foiled.\par \par \uc2 The Democratic platform holds that the U.S. "has signed too many trade deals that have not lived up to the hype," but the rhetoric isn't nearly as strident as Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's. And rather than opposing the TPP, it merely says trade agreements need to meet certain standards. For companies that rely on imports, and for exporters that could face retaliatory tariffs, the Democrats' position on trade may now be the friendlier one.\par \par \uc2 Immigration is another area of role reversal. The Democratic platform is far more positive on immigration than the toughened stance in the GOP platform. For companies that have come to rely on immigrant workers, the Democrats' view could have advantages.\par \par \uc2 Platforms aren't binding. So even though investment strategists have been busy putting together portfolios of stocks that might rise or fall under a \uc2 Clinton\uc2  or \uc2 Trump\uc2  presidency, what the \uc2 election\uc2  will actually mean for investors is hard to fathom. But it doesn't seem likely to be business as usual.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=wjco20160726000056"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document J000000020160726ec7q0004t\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw272\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4080\pichgoal600

\par\par \b \uc2 U.S. News: \uc2 EPA\uc2  Moves to Curb Aircraft Emissions --- Agency concludes that carbon from plane exhaust endangers public health\b0\par\par\uc2 By Amy Harder and Jon Ostrower   \par \uc2 494 \uc2 words\par \uc2 26 July 2016\par \uc2 The Wall Street Journal\par \uc2 J\par A2\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 The \uc2 Environmental Protection Agency\uc2  advanced plans Monday to limit carbon emissions from aircraft, one of a string of actions President Barack Obama is pursuing in his climate agenda that affects large swaths of the U.S. economy.\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 EPA\uc2  issued a final scientific assessment concluding carbon emissions from aircraft endanger public health and welfare, a legal prerequisite the agency must take before regulating those emissions.\par \par \uc2 Whether the \uc2 EPA\uc2  follows through with proposed rules depends largely on who wins the November presidential \uc2 election\uc2 , as any rule couldn't be completed by January.\par \par \uc2 Presumptive Democratic nominee \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  has said she would keep pursuing and expand Mr. Obama's climate regulations. Republican nominee \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  has questioned the scientific findings underpinning the administration's climate rules and has vowed to repeal them.\par \par \uc2 EPA\uc2  officials said last year, when first proposing the aircraft scientific assessment, that any regulation would be implemented in coordination with the \uc2 International Civil Aviation Organization\uc2 , an arm of the United Nations, which is drafting a global standard for airline carbon emissions.\par \par \uc2 Emissions from aircraft represent about 2% of total global carbon emissions, and the U.S. is the largest contributor to global aviation greenhouse gases, according to federal data. The \uc2 EPA\uc2  said aircraft are the third-largest source of greenhouse-gas emissions in the U.S. transportation sector, accounting for about 3% of such emissions.\par \par \uc2 "\uc2 EPA\uc2  has already set effective [greenhouse gas] standards for cars and trucks, and any future aircraft-engine standards will also provide important climate and public-health benefits," said Janet McCabe, \uc2 EPA\uc2  acting assistant administrator for air and radiation.\par \par \uc2 The finding issued Monday is the latest in an array of regulatory actions the Obama administration has taken over the last several years to clamp down on greenhouse-gas emissions that most scientists blame for climate change.\par \par \uc2 EPA\uc2  officials indicated on Monday that the agency could eventually adopt standards stronger than global standards adopted by the \uc2 ICAO\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 EPA\uc2 's scientific finding applies to 89% of U.S. aircraft carbon emissions, with exemptions for military and small piston-engine planes often used for recreational purposes.\par \par \uc2 Airlines for America\uc2 , the trade association representing U.S. airlines and air cargo carriers, said it commends the \uc2 EPA\uc2 's action because it is working within the coming international framework.\par \par \uc2 "As aviation is a global industry, with airlines operating internationally and aircraft manufacturers selling their aircraft in international markets, it is critical that aircraft emissions standards be set at the international level and not imposed unilaterally by one country or set of countries," said \uc2 Vaughn Jennings\uc2 , spokesman for Airlines for America.\par \par \uc2 Environmental groups also praised the move.\par \par \uc2 "\uc2 EPA\uc2 's endangerment finding today sets the stage for the U.S. to step up," said Annie Petsonk, international counsel at the Environmental Defense Fund.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=wjco20160726000051"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document J000000020160726ec7q0004o\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw272\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4080\pichgoal600

\par\par \b \uc2 Trump\uc2 's -- and FDR's -- 'Forgotten Man'\b0\par\par\uc2 By Amity Shlaes   \par \uc2 1,054 \uc2 words\par \uc2 26 July 2016\par \uc2 The Wall Street Journal\par \uc2 J\par A15\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 "I have visited the laid-off factory workers, and the communities crushed by our horrible and unfair trade deals. These are the forgotten men and women of our country."\par \par \uc2 -- \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2 , July 21, 2016\par \par \uc2 This year's Republican presidential nominee is not the first politician to utter the phrase "forgotten man." The term has periodically surfaced since the late 19th century, when voters learned that the forgotten man opposed the Dingley Tariff. Yet it still resonates today. Two years ago \uc2 Sarah Palin\uc2  told the Western Conservative Summit that "what the forgotten man has is belief in this exceptional nation."\par \par \uc2 But what do politicians mean by the forgotten man? Two opposing definitions predominate. Which of these Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  chooses will tell us the kind of president he might make.\par \par \uc2 The forgotten man emerged in the 1880s in the lectures of a Yale professor named William Graham Sumner. A Thomas Piketty in reverse, Sumner abhorred efforts to equalize society and offered an elegant equation: "As soon as A observes something which seems to him to be wrong, from which X is suffering, A talks it over with B, and A and B then propose to get a law passed to remedy the evil and help X. Their law always proposes to determine what C shall do for X or, in the better case, what A, B and C shall do for X."\par \par \uc2 "C" is the forgotten man, declared Sumner, a kind of everyman who falls into no category: "He works, he votes, generally he prays -- but he always pays -- yes, above all, he pays."\par \par \uc2 Sumner, a classical liberal, believed that strong commerce helped the poor better than the best government benefit. "If you do anything for the Forgotten Man, you must secure him his earnings and savings, that is, you legislate for the security of capital and for its free employment," Sumner wrote.\par \par \uc2 "Jobbery," as Sumner called it, also wounded the forgotten man. In the 1870s and 1880s, the era of Tweed and Tammany, municipal and county governments joined private contractors to build public structures. Sumner skewered such projects: "They are carried out, not because they are needed in themselves, but because they will serve the turn of some private interest." He added that "the biggest job of all is a protective tariff," which generates forgotten men and forgotten costs to consumers.\par \par \uc2 Sumner's forgotten man was a political phenomenon, a warning that supplied arguments for reformers of both parties. His chum William Whitney helped lead anti-Tammany Democrats and served in Grover Cleveland's cabinet.\par \par \uc2 That we know so little about Sumner, who died in 1910, is evidence of the thoroughness of the progressive takeover of academic culture. By the early 1930s and the Great Depression, a different forgotten man had stepped onto the political stage. Raymond Moley, campaign adviser to New York's Gov. Franklin Roosevelt, was drafting a speech that the presidential candidate was to give on the Lucky Strike Radio Hour. "I scraped from my memory an old phrase, 'The Forgotten Man,' which has haunted me for years," Moley later explained.\par \par \uc2 The forgotten man FDR sketched was not the universal "C" but "X," the man, as Roosevelt put it, "at the bottom of the economic pyramid." The key difference was that Roosevelt would single out specific groups, starting with the poor.\par \par \uc2 FDR's forgotten man was the opposite of Sumner's. Roosevelt's predecessor as the Democrats' presidential nominee, Al Smith, objected to the switch. Smith, himself from the humblest of backgrounds, warned that highlighting class distinctions divided the country when it needed to pull together. "The Forgotten Man is a myth," Smith said, "and the sooner he disappears from the campaign the better it will be for the country."\par \par \uc2 FDR's forgotten man carried him to victory in 1932 and defined the platform of his subsequent presidential campaign. As the 1936 \uc2 election\uc2  neared, Roosevelt identified and rewarded one group of "forgottens" after another.\par \par \uc2 Unions received the Wagner Act, the right to bargain collectively. Senior citizens received Social Security. Municipal lobbies got billions for "jobbery." The unemployed received payments or make-work jobs. At \uc2 Howard University\uc2 , Roosevelt thundered that "there should be no forgotten men and no forgotten races."\par \par \uc2 This interest-group strategy netted FDR a stunning victory in 1936 -- 46 of 48 states -- and provided a template that has since served not only his party but also Latin American governments. The forgotten footnote is that the economic outcome of FDR's program vindicated Sumner. Remembering so many forgotten men meant forgetting the average worker. The slump that followed FDR's spending blitz drove unemployment back into the high teens.\par \par \uc2 Hoisting FDR by his own rhetoric, an Indiana paper asked: "Who is the forgotten man in Muncie? I know him as intimately as my own undershirt. He is the fellow that is trying to get along without public relief."\par \par \uc2 More recent sightings include Richard Nixon's 1968 campaign, when he spoke of "the great majority of Americans, the forgotten Americans -- the non-shouters, the non-demonstrators."\par \par \uc2 And where stands Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 ? With Sumner's anonymous crowd, or Roosevelt's specific groups? That Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  is by temperament a man of deals suggests he will be inclined toward FDR's way of thinking. Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's Atlantic City projects fit perfectly into the Sumneresque definition of "jobbery." Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's unabashed protectionism does not recall Roosevelt, an exception as a free trader, but it does recall the Democratic Party.\par \par \uc2 But Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  does not pit rich against poor. He may end up standing more for the universal than the individual.\par \par \uc2 We're told this \uc2 election\uc2  is "different." Perhaps different enough that we will get a real discussion of the consequences of rewarding groups. Sumner's distinction between "jobbery" and true capitalism is one that many voters would be thrilled to see Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  recognize. And how fabulous it would be if \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  took on Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  over trade with the vigor of a Sumner. Here's an opening question for the first \uc2 Trump\uc2 -\uc2 Clinton\uc2  debate: "Who is the forgotten man?"\par \par \uc2 ---\par \par \uc2 Miss Shlaes, author of "The Forgotten Man: A New History of the Great Depression" (Harper, 2007), is a presidential scholar at King's College.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=wjco20160726000030"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document J000000020160726ec7q00043\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw272\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4080\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 REVIEW & OUTLOOK (Editorial)\par \b \uc2 Putin and Those Democratic Emails\b0\par\par\uc2 487 \uc2 words\par \uc2 26 July 2016\par \uc2 The Wall Street Journal\par \uc2 J\par A14\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 Here's the last word Democrats wanted to hear at their Philadelphia convention this week: emails. But there it was after \uc2 WikiLeaks\uc2  released 20,000 internal emails hacked from the \uc2 Democratic National Committee\uc2  revealing, among other things, that party officials had favored \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  over Bernie Sanders.\par \par \uc2 That wasn't news, but it gave the Sanders legions a new opening to vent their frustration with the establishment. Their fury brought down \uc2 Debbie Wasserman Schultz\uc2 , the party chair, who on Sunday announced her resignation at the end of the convention but by Monday had been strong-armed by the \uc2 Clinton\uc2  campaign to abandon any convention role.\par \par \uc2 Remember those Casualties of Bill (\uc2 Clinton\uc2 ) from the 1990s? Ms. Wasserman Schultz is the first Casualty of Hillary in this \uc2 Clinton\uc2  comeback. She had to go for the sake of party unity but also because the DNC emails remind Americans of another batch of emails, those belonging to the former Secretary of State.\par \par \uc2 On that score, it was startling to hear the \uc2 Clinton\uc2  campaign respond to the email leak by blaming Russia. Campaign manager Robby Mook accused Russian "state actors" of divulging the emails for "the purpose of helping \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2 ," and even suggested several pro-Russian provisions in the recent GOP platform were behind the leak. The media is now noting that \uc2 Trump\uc2  campaign manager \uc2 Paul Manafort\uc2  once worked for a \uc2 Vladimir Putin\uc2  crony.\par \par \uc2 Nothing is beyond Mr. Putin, especially since he is already trying to influence European elections. His allies are bankrolling France's National Front leader, Marine Le Pen, they supported Britain's exit from the \uc2 European Union\uc2  and fabricated stories this spring to undercut Chancellor \uc2 Angela Merkel\uc2  in regional elections. Vlad the \uc2 Election\uc2  Impaler might well prefer Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  in the Oval Office, even if Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  was an architect of President Obama's 2009 "reset" with Russia.\par \par \uc2 But then again, Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's self-serving email set-up made it easier for him to meddle. FBI Director James Comey recently said that it is likely that her private email server was hacked by "hostile actors" even if he found no specific evidence that it was. Former CIA Director Michael Hayden has said that he'd "lose respect for any serious intelligence agency on this planet if they had not accessed the emails" on her server.\par \par \uc2 Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  went to great lengths to hide her emails, perhaps because they contain details about the inner workings of the \uc2 Clinton\uc2  Foundation\uc2  and political machine. Could the \uc2 Clinton\uc2  camp be blaming Russia for the DNC leak in pre-emptive anticipation that her emails will also eventually be leaked? This would certainly make for a big October surprise.\par \par \uc2 We don't agree with Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  about Mr. Putin, but Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  is the candidate who made her emails and U.S. secrets vulnerable to hackers.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=wjco20160726000023"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document J000000020160726ec7q0003w\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw272\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4080\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 President Obama said in 2008 that he wanted to be the reverse Ronald Reagan, and in one sense he has been. As he takes the Democratic stage in Philadelphia Tuesday he can rightly claim to have fulfilled most of his major progressive policy goals. The difference is the results. After eight years of Reagan, the Cold War was on the way to ending and the U.S. economy had grown by the size of Germany. Mr. Obama is leaving to his successor a world of spreading disorder and a country as economically anxious and more politically polarized than he inherited.\par \par \uc2 Even opponents of Mr. Obama's agenda have to admit that he has achieved most of what he campaigned on. With a Democratic supermajority in 2009-2010, he passed the largest stimulus spending bill in decades, pushed through ObamaCare, nationalized the student-loan industry, and turned the banks into public utilities answerable first to government.\par \par \uc2 Democrats resisted him on cap and trade and union card check, but he has since achieved by executive fiat most of what he wanted on climate change and labor organizing. As the Bush tax rates expired in 2013, he insisted on and won a huge tax increase. His one major unfulfilled ambition is immigration reform, but that hangs on who nominates the next Supreme Court Justice.\par \par \uc2 On foreign policy, he has also largely fulfilled his goal of reducing America's global commitments. He has struck deals with adversaries and distanced the U.S. from allies. Perhaps most important, by refusing to reform entitlements he has narrowed the budget room for future military spending. He has put defense spending on a path to 3% of GDP, and falling, down from 4.6% when he took office. He has Europeanized the U.S. defense budget.\par \par \uc2 ---\par \par \uc2 Democrats will cheer all of this, yet they might stop to ask themselves why, amid so much progressive success, the country is so frustrated and miserable. When Reagan left office the U.S. mood was buoyant and Americans celebrated immigration as a point of national pride. The political turmoil of the 1970s had vanished.\par \par \uc2 As Mr. Obama leaves office, the national mood is more sour than at anytime since the 1960s. The polls say some two-thirds of the voters think the country is on the "wrong track," and a majority say they expect their children to do less well financially than they did. This reflects the historically slow economic recovery and incomes that have only recently begun to return to where they were when the recession ended.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Obama will claim he inherited a recession (he did) and saved the U.S. from depression (doubtful), but his policies have been in place for eight years. His appointees run the \uc2 Federal Reserve\uc2 . He is the one who chose to block tax reform and pile regulatory costs on nearly every part of the U.S. economy.\par \par \uc2 The resulting economic anxiety that sometimes becomes anger is bipartisan. Sanders and \uc2 Trump\uc2  voters represent the mirror image of frustration with slow growth and stagnant incomes, even if they prefer different villains. The Sanders crowd blames inequality, big business and foreign trade. The Trumpians blame big government and business, immigration and foreign trade. Neither vindicates the results of Obamanomics.\par \par \uc2 These frustrations also reflect an American politics that is increasingly divided by ideology, age, race, class and gender. This is in no small part the result of Mr. Obama's governing strategy. When Democrats ran Congress with supermajorities, he settled for passing his agenda on partisan votes. He thus built no durable consensus for ObamaCare.\par \par \uc2 His strategy became even more partisan after Democrats lost Congress in 2010. Mr. Obama backed out of a budget deal with \uc2 John Boehner\uc2  in 2011 at the last minute because he wanted a bigger tax increase. To win re-\uc2 election\uc2 , he played the race card to mobilize minority voters and class warfare to demonize \uc2 Mitt Romney\uc2 . After his 2012 victory, he all but gave up working with Congress and has governed by regulatory decree, daring Republicans and the courts to stop him.\par \par \uc2 As for the world, U.S. retreat has produced the opposite of Reagan's pax Americana. His premature departure from Iraq and abdication on Syria created a vacuum for Islamic State. A refugee crisis threatens Middle East stability and torments Europe with terror attacks on trains and family outings to view fireworks. Authoritarians in Iran, Russia and China are advancing to dominate their regions.\par \par \uc2 After Reagan, George H.W. Bush could cut defense spending and conduct a Cold War mopping up operation. After Mr. Obama, the next President will have to spend more on defense and rebuild U.S. credibility.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Obama won't acknowledge it, but this is the reality that made it possible for Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  to give last week's speech with its litany of U.S. decline. He couldn't have done it if tens of millions of Americans didn't believe it. Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's unique liabilities may still allow \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  to win a third Obama term, but on all the evidence they won't be happy about it.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=wjco20160726000021"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document J000000020160726ec7q0003u\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw272\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4080\pichgoal600

\par\par \b \uc2 Clinton\uc2  Won the Battle, Sanders the War\b0\par\par\uc2 By Juan Williams   \par \uc2 1,106 \uc2 words\par \uc2 25 July 2016\par \uc2 The Wall Street Journal\par \uc2 J\par A11\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 Bill \uc2 Clinton\uc2  took Democrats to the political middle. He met with Republicans to pass welfare-to-work laws and put more police on the streets. \uc2 Barack Obama\uc2  steered the party leftward with "change we can believe in." He promised to end long-running wars, deliver an economic recovery, offer medical coverage to the uninsured and unify an increasingly diverse nation.\par \par \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  will claim the Democratic nomination this week in Philadelphia, but the party is no longer defined by its standard-bearer. The energy rests instead with a rising generation of Democrats excited to use activist government to protect them in anxious economic times.\par \par \uc2 Older Democrats and minority voters provided a "firewall" that allowed Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  to defeat her rival in the primaries, Sen. Bernie Sanders. Democrats who call themselves "somewhat liberal" went for Hillary by 13 percentage points, according to exit poll data analyzed by Public Opinion Strategies. "Moderates" backed her by 23 percentage points. But among the quarter of Democrats who see themselves as "very liberal," she ran even with the socialist.\par \par \uc2 Bernie Sanders and his activist supporters have moved Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  and the party's platform to the left. The result is that the Democrats have taken on an identity that comes from a new base: voters under 40 who have no problem with Mr. Sanders's socialist vision. A 2015 study by the \uc2 Pew Research Center\uc2  found that 51% of millennials "identify as Democrats or lean Democratic," compared with only 35% for Republicans. Two-fifths of millennials are people of color and immigrants.\par \par \uc2 This is not your father's -- or even your older sister's -- Democratic Party. It is far more left-leaning than under \uc2 Bill \uc2 Clinton\uc2  or President \uc2 Obama\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Almost 60% of Democratic voters agree that "socialism has a positive" impact on society, according to a February poll by OnMessage Inc. and the American Action Network. In Iowa 43% of Democrats said in January that they would use the word "socialist" to describe themselves, a survey by the Des Moines Register and Bloomberg Politics found.\par \par \uc2 Forty-seven percent of Democrats told Gallup last year that they are both "socially liberal and economically moderate/liberal" -- the highest level in the poll's history. In 2001 only 30% of Democrats described themselves that way. Between 2000 and 2015 the percentage of "Democratic and Democratic-leaning registered voters" who consider themselves liberal has gone up to 42% from 27%, according to a Pew study in February.\par \par \uc2 Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  has been running to the front of this liberal parade. This month she wrapped her arms around one of Mr. Sanders's biggest causes by backing tuition-free college at in-state public universities for families making under $125,000 a year.\par \par \uc2 She broke with Mr. Obama by calling for repeal of the so-called Cadillac tax on health-insurance plans, a priority for labor unions. She gave a sop to the teachers unions by backtracking on her decades-old support for charter schools. It is clear that in this new liberal order of Democratic politics, the unions will be the enforcers.\par \par \uc2 Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  is now even backing a "public option" -- a Medicare-style government program to compete against private insurance companies. This idea was so radioactive during the debate over the Affordable Care Act that Democrats jettisoned it for fear of being tarred as proponents of socialized medicine.\par \par \uc2 With the implicit support of Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  and her allies, the Sanders coalition added language to the Democratic platform calling to raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour, put a price on climate-altering emissions like carbon, and abolish the death penalty.\par \par \uc2 The party also stripped out language supporting the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal, which Mr. Sanders opposed during the campaign. Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  had once praised the deal a "gold standard," but last fall she withdrew her support.\par \par \uc2 "It is no secret that \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  and I disagree on a number of issues," Mr. Sanders said this month as he endorsed her in New Hampshire. He correctly noted that the threat of a divided party had forced Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  to accept "the most progressive platform in the history of the Democratic Party."\par \par \uc2 Mr. Sanders then urged his supporters to keep the pressure on: "Our job now is to see that platform implemented by a Democratic Senate, a Democratic House and a Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  presidency -- and I am going to do everything I can to make that happen." The Vermonter has a stronger hand to play after the success of his populist campaign.\par \par \uc2 Meanwhile, Democrats in Congress have become more liberal -- the mirror image of what has happened to the GOP. Democratic incumbents who were defeated during the \uc2 Obama\uc2  years were largely centrists from red states: Sens. \uc2 Mary Landrieu\uc2  of Louisiana, Mark Pryor of Arkansas and Mark Begich of Alaska.\par \par \uc2 After the 2012 \uc2 election\uc2 , much was written, including by me, about whether the \uc2 Obama\uc2  coalition of young people, blacks, Hispanics, gays and single women would keep Democrats in the White House for the near future. No one predicted that first of these core constituencies, young people, would become so vocally liberal.\par \par \uc2 A final factor is the GOP's strategy of unrelenting obstructionism against President \uc2 Obama\uc2 , which sparked a low-grade fury among the left wing. This is why Monday night's convention speaker, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, gets hundreds of thousands of views every time she posts a fiery speech on \uc2 YouTube\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Senate Republicans have refused to have a hearing, much less a vote, on \uc2 Merrick Garland\uc2 , President \uc2 Obama\uc2 's nominee to fill the vacancy on the Supreme Court.

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 Nationwide fear of the reckless and shady \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  as the next U.S. commander in chief -- and at least a 12-year streak of Democrats in the White House -- means that a Republican presidential victory in November cannot be ruled out. But why, with a rival so highly unlikable, is GOP candidate \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  unable to excite a wider number of voters?\par \par \uc2 One glaring problem is that Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , who has an undergraduate degree from the \uc2 University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School\uc2 , fails economics. Exhibit A is his promise to shred the \uc2 North American Free Trade Agreement\uc2  (\uc2 Nafta\uc2 ) on the grounds that Mexico, his favorite bete noire, is stealing American jobs. It is technology, not free trade, that is behind the shrinking number of U.S. manufacturing jobs.\par \par \uc2 Beating Nafta like a pinata worked in the Republican primary. But it is likely to hurt Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  and GOP candidates further down the ticket in the general \uc2 election\uc2 . Mexico is, after all, the U.S.'s third-largest trading partner and second-largest export market.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's trade tirades undermine his credibility with voters who know better. And that's a lot of voters. Americans from every walk of life are beneficiaries of U.S. global trade.\par \par \uc2 Indiana, the home of GOP vice-presidential candidate \uc2 Gov. Mike Pence\uc2 , exported some $4.8 billion of goods to Mexico in 2015, making it the state's second-largest export market. That included $1.5 billion in transportation equipment, $1.4 billion in machinery and $88 million in corn-fructose products. More than 120,000 Hoosier jobs depend on trade with Mexico.\par \par \uc2 Exports to Mexico were over $1 billion in 31 states in 2015. It's the largest export market for California, Arizona, New Mexico and Texas. It ranks second for 25 other states.\par \par \uc2 To hear the \uc2 Trump\uc2  campaign tell it, American workers who don't want to increase protectionism are coddled members of the "elite." Yet the majority of people employed in today's globally connected, tech-driven U.S. economy hail from middle-class families who made financial sacrifices to prepare them to compete in the modern workforce. It's dispiriting to hear the GOP nominee denigrate achievers and try to pit Americans against one another.\par \par \uc2 Higher tariffs on U.S. imports will be passed on to American consumers, many of whom are already hurting economically due to the sluggish Obama recovery. Trade wars will also damage U.S. competitiveness. As former Mexican deputy trade minister Luis de la Calle explained in a conference call to investors in New York earlier this month, \uc2 Carrier Corp\uc2 .'s production move to Mexico from Indiana -- much-assailed by Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  -- means that the company can survive Asian competition and can retain U.S. jobs in research, development, marketing and high-end components.\par \par \uc2 Perhaps the biggest lie that Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  peddles is that higher tariffs can restore lost U.S. manufacturing jobs. They won't, and to suggest otherwise is a cruel hoax.\par \par \uc2 In a recent Foreign Affairs magazine essay titled "The Truth About Trade," Dartmouth economist Douglas Irwin observes that while technology has "enabled vast productivity and efficiency improvements," it has "also made many blue-collar jobs obsolete." Mr. Irwin cites a study by the Center for Business and Economic Research at \uc2 Ball State University\uc2 , which "found that productivity growth accounted for more than 85 percent of the job loss in manufacturing between 2000 and 2010, a period when employment in that sector fell by 5.6 million." This 85% compares, according to the study, with 13% of job losses attributed to trade during the same period. In other words, to bring most jobs back, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  would have to outlaw mechanization. Will Mr. Pence break the news to Indiana farmers?\par \par \uc2 In a paper published last summer in the Journal of Economic Perspectives, MIT economist David Autor unpacks the reason automation has hit the middle-class hard. He observes that in order to write code for a task, a programmer must be able to "enunciate the explicit 'rules' or procedures" necessary to do it. But tasks understood by humans "tacitly" are not easy to automate. Mr. Autor calls this constraint "Polanyi's paradox" after the Hungarian-born chemist and economist who observed that "we know more than we can tell."\par \par \uc2 It is "high-education" and "low-education" jobs -- requiring "interpersonal interaction, flexibility, adaptability and problem solving" -- that are most difficult to automate Mr. Autor notes. Traditional middle-education jobs have been the easiest to replace with technology.\par \par \uc2 Yet there is also strong evidence of adaptation in the middle of the pack. Mr. Autor cites a couple of economists who have identified evidence of new job creation for this group. The catch, he says, is that "human capital investment must be at the heart of any long-term strategy for producing skills that are complemented by rather than substituted for by technological change."\par \par \uc2 Protectionism is populist demagoguery and will only impoverish the middle class. Many Americans see through Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's false promises, which is one reason he's in a tight race despite Hillary's high negatives.\par \par \uc2 (See related letters: "Letters to the Editor: \uc2 Trump\uc2 , Trade, Technology and American Jobs" -- WSJ Aug. 1, 2016)\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=wjco20160725000016"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document J000000020160725ec7p00003\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 National Desk; SECTA\par \b \uc2 In Hacking, Russia Is Accused of Playing in American Politics\b0\par\par\uc2 By DAVID E. SANGER and NICOLE PERLROTH; David E. Sanger reported from Washington, and Nicole Perlroth from Olympic Valley, Calif. Nick Corasaniti contributed reporting from Washington. \par \uc2 1,402 \uc2 words\par \uc2 25 July 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 1\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 WASHINGTON -- An unusual question is capturing the attention of cyberspecialists, Russia experts and Democratic Party leaders in Philadelphia: Is \uc2 Vladimir V. Putin\uc2  trying to meddle in the American presidential \uc2 election\uc2 ?\par \par \uc2 Until Friday, that charge, with its eerie suggestion of a Kremlin conspiracy to aid \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , has been only whispered.\par \par \uc2 But the release on Friday of some 20,000 stolen emails from the \uc2 Democratic National Committee\uc2 's computer servers, many of them embarrassing to Democratic leaders, has intensified discussion of the role of Russian intelligence agencies in disrupting the 2016 campaign.\par \par \uc2 The emails, released first by a supposed hacker and later by \uc2 WikiLeaks\uc2 , exposed the degree to which the Democratic apparatus favored \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  over her primary rival, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, and triggered the resignation of \uc2 Debbie Wasserman Schultz\uc2 , the party chairwoman, on the eve of the convention's first day.\par \par \uc2 Proving the source of a cyberattack is notoriously difficult. But researchers have concluded that the national committee was breached by two Russian intelligence agencies, which were the same attackers behind previous Russian cyberoperations at the White House, the State Department and the Joint Chiefs of Staff last year. And metadata from the released emails suggests that the documents passed through Russian computers. Though a hacker claimed responsibility for giving the emails to \uc2 WikiLeaks\uc2 , the same agencies are the prime suspects. Whether the thefts were ordered by Mr. Putin, or just carried out by apparatchiks who thought they might please him, is anyone's guess.\par \par \uc2 On Sunday morning, the issue erupted, as Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's campaign manager, Robby Mook, argued on ABC's ''This Week'' that the emails were leaked ''by the Russians for the purpose of helping \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2 '' citing ''experts'' but offering no other evidence. Mr. Mook also suggested that the Russians might have good reason to support Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 : The Republican nominee indicated in an interview with The \uc2 New York Times\uc2  last week that he might not back \uc2 NATO\uc2  nations if they came under attack from Russia -- unless he was first convinced that the countries had made sufficient contributions to the Atlantic alliance.\par \par \uc2 It was a remarkable moment: Even at the height of the Cold War, it was hard to find a presidential campaign willing to charge that its rival was essentially secretly doing the bidding of a key American adversary. But the accusation is emerging as a theme of Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's campaign, as part of an attempt to portray Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  not only as an isolationist, but also as one who would go soft on confronting Russia as it threatens nations that have shown too much independence from Moscow or, in the case of Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia, joined \uc2 NATO\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  has also said he would like to ''get along with Russia'' if he is elected, and complimented Mr. Putin, saying he is more of a leader than President Obama. Mr. Putin has in turn praised Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 . But \uc2 Trump\uc2  campaign officials on Sunday strongly rejected any connections between their candidate and efforts to undermine the Democrats.\par \par \uc2 ''Are there any ties between Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , you or your campaign and Putin and his regime?'' George Stephanopoulos, of ''This Week,'' asked \uc2 Paul Manafort\uc2 , Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's campaign chairman.\par \par \uc2 ''No, there are not,'' Mr. Manafort shot back. ''That's absurd. And, you know, there's no basis to it.''\par \par \uc2 One of Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's sons, Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  Jr., was more definitive, charging the \uc2 Clinton\uc2  camp with a smear campaign. ''I can't think of bigger lies,'' he said on \uc2 CNN\uc2 . The younger Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  mockingly suggested that Mr. Mook's ''house cat at home once said this is what happened with the Russians.''\par \par \uc2 It may take months, or years, to figure out the motives of those who stole the emails, and more important, whether they were being commanded by Russian authorities, and specifically by Mr. Putin. But the theft from the national committee would be among the most important state-sponsored hacks yet of an American organization, rivaled only by the attacks on the Office of Personnel Management by state-sponsored Chinese hackers, and the attack on \uc2 Sony Pictures Entertainment\uc2 , which Mr. Obama blamed on North Korea. There, too, embarrassing emails were released, but they had no political significance. The \uc2 WikiLeaks\uc2  release, however, has more of a tinge of Russian-style information war, in which the intent of the revelations is to alter political events. Exactly how, though, is a bit of a mystery, apart from embarrassing Democrats and further alienating Mr. Sanders's supporters from Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Evidence so far suggests that the attack was the work of at least two separate agencies, each apparently working without the knowledge that the other was inside the Democrats' computers. It is unclear how \uc2 WikiLeaks\uc2  obtained the email trove. But the presumption is that the intelligence agencies turned it over, either directly or through an intermediary. Moreover, the timing of the release, between the end of the Republican convention and the beginning of the Democratic one, seems too well planned to be coincidental.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  himself leapt on the news after the \uc2 WikiLeaks\uc2  release on Saturday. In a \uc2 Twitter\uc2  message he wrote: ''Leaked emails of DNC show plans to destroy Bernie Sanders. Mock his heritage and much more. On-line from Wikileakes, really vicious. RIGGED.''\par \par \uc2 The experts cited by Mr. Mook include \uc2 CrowdStrike\uc2 , a cybersecurity firm that was brought into the \uc2 Democratic National Committee\uc2  when officials there suspected they had been hacked.\par \par \uc2 In mid-June the company announced that the intruders appeared to include a group it had previously identified by the name ''Cozy Bear'' or ''APT 29'' and been inside the committee's servers for a year. A second group, ''Fancy Bear,'' also called ''APT 28,'' came into the system in April. It appears to be operated by the G.R.U., the Russian military intelligence service, according to federal investigators and private cybersecurity firms. The first group is particularly well known to the F.B.I.'s counterintelligence unit, the C.I.A. and other intelligence agencies. It was identified by federal investigators as the likely culprit behind years of intrusions into the State Department and White House unclassified computer system.\par \par \uc2 Russian intelligence agencies went to great lengths to cover their tracks, investigators found, including meticulously deleting logs, and changing the time stamps of the stolen files.\par \par \uc2 Officials at several other firms that have examined the code for the malware used against the \uc2 Democratic National Committee\uc2  and the metadata of the stolen documents found evidence that the documents had been accessed by multiple computers, some with Russian language settings. Moscow has outsourced politically motivated hacking to outside groups in the past. A crippling attack on Estonia in 2007, for example, was attributed to the pro-Kremlin Nashi youth organization. Intelligence officials and security researchers believe this outsourcing is done, in part, to preserve a measure of plausible deniability.\par \par \uc2 Intrusions for intelligence collection are hardly unusual, and the United States often does the same, stealing emails and other secrets from intelligence services and even political parties. But the release to \uc2 WikiLeaks\uc2  adds another strange element, because it suggests that the intelligence findings are being ''weaponized'' -- used to influence the \uc2 election\uc2  in some way. The story has another level of intrigue involving Mr. Manafort, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's campaign chairman. Working through his lobbying firm, Mr. Manafort was one of several American advisers to Viktor F. Yanukovych, the Russian-backed leader of Ukraine until he was forced out of office two years ago. Mr. Yanukovych was a key Putin ally who is now in exile in Russia.\par \par \uc2 In April, asked on Fox News about his relationship with Mr. Yanukovych, Mr. Manafort said he was simply trying to help the Ukrainians build a democracy that could align more closely with the United States and its allies.\par \par \uc2 Find out what you need to know about the 2016 presidential race today, and get politics news updates via \uc2 Facebook\uc2 , \uc2 Twitter\uc2  and the First Draft newsletter.\par \par \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2  last week during his acceptance speech at the Republican National Convention.

\par\par \uc2 OP-ED CONTRIBUTOR\par \uc2 Editorial Desk; SECTA\par \b \uc2 Philly Is Hillary's Kind of Town\b0\par\par\uc2 By JENNIFER WEINER \par \uc2 1,409 \uc2 words\par \uc2 25 July 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 23\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 PHILADELPHIA -- Once it became clear that Philadelphia would host the Democratic National Convention, and that \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  would be the nominee, I started thinking about my city, and how well it suits her.\par \par \uc2 I've lived here since 1994. I came here to work as a reporter, and I've stayed to write books and raise my daughters.\par \par \uc2 To many people, Philly's still the rough-around-the-edges Acela stop between the glittering poles of Washington and New York. Here we are, in the middle -- a little overlooked, a little resentful, entirely our own place, apt to get snappish if you suggest that we're Brooklyn Lite or think we're nothing more than ''Rocky.''\par \par \uc2 Our attractions can have an eat-your-vegetables feel -- Independence Hall, the Liberty Bell, the places a million Girl Scouts and field trippers have been herded through. Tell middle schoolers that they're going to New York or Washington and you'll get bounces of excitement. Philadelphia gets sullen shrugs and ''I guess so's.''\par \par \uc2 Maybe that sounds familiar to a woman who's been characterized as an eat-your-vegetables kind of candidate, more dogged than dazzling, stuck between the poles of \uc2 Bill \uc2 Clinton\uc2  and \uc2 Barack Obama\uc2 , two of our most gifted speakers and charismatic leaders.\par \par \uc2 We aren't perfect. We've got a long list of missteps, goofs and gaffes, caught-on-tape embarrassment and hilariously venal politicians. We're the place where tourists die on Duck Boat rides and people are killed by a collapsing building. At the dedication of our beautiful new Constitution Center, a huge falling piece of scenery almost took out Justice Sandra Day O'Connor. In 1985, our police bombed a house in a residential neighborhood occupied by a black liberation group called MOVE, killing 11.\par \par \uc2 We are where the Declaration of Independence was signed, where the Liberty Bell rang, and where Alexander Hamilton cheated on his wife with Maria Reynolds, whose love letters rival any teenager's sexts for their cringe factor (''Oh my God I feel more for you than myself and wish I had never been born to give you so mutch unhappiness.'')\par \par \uc2 Sure, Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  has got a server scandal and Benghazi. We gave the world Wing Bowl. She stood by her husband when he dallied with an intern. We claimed Bill Cosby, even as the rumors and whispers and, finally, reports about lawsuits made the rounds.\par \par \uc2 We get each other, the candidate and the city. We are both derided, scarred, flawed, still standing. Immovable. I doubt that Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  will have much down time during the convention, but if she does, here is the Philadelphia I'd want to show her.\par \par \uc2 We could start at the south end of Broad Street where, every New Year's Day, men in skirts and sequins known as Mummers march and dance and twirl and sometimes also make fun of trans people and Native Americans, among others, reminding the world that here, in the cradle of American democracy, there are plenty of people who might like what they hear when the Republican candidate for president says, ''We cannot afford to be so politically correct anymore.''\par \par \uc2 We could walk through the site of the Lombard Street riots, where, in 1871, white Philadelphians, enraged that blacks had won the right to vote, shot and killed the civil rights campaigner Octavius Catto, a black man who, historians note, had been on his way home to pick up ammunition for the newly purchased gun that was part of his national guard uniform.\par \par \uc2 Maybe we'll stroll up Locust Street, toward the jewelry stores and the expensive boutiques, where we'll pass \uc2 Planned Parenthood\uc2  and the protesters. Once, one of them once yelled at my friend Jamie, when she was pushing her stroller, on her way to the gym, ''Thanks, Mom, for not killing your baby,'' and Jamie yelled back, over her daughter's wails, ''I'm pro-choice! Do you think a teenager should be forced to do this?!''\par \par \uc2 We could make our way to Queen Village, my neighborhood, leafy and lovely, with brick rowhouses, little cafes and hidden parks. We'll walk to Monroe Street, and my first apartment -- two bedrooms, hardwood floors, central air, dishwasher and garbage disposal and a shared garden in the back, $600 a month in 1994.\par \par \uc2 I set up my metal-legged folding bridge table in the second bedroom and wrote my first novel on a Mac Classic, imagining that I'd find an agent and sell a book, and someday, my dreams would come true and I would be happy.\par \par \uc2 I wonder if Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  ever thought like that. If Bill wins the \uc2 election\uc2 . If he wins another term. If I become a senator. If I become president, that would be enough. People slam her for her drive. They say she is all raw ambition, no heart; a soulless automaton with her eyes eternally on the prize who will do, or say, or forgive anything to get what she wants. I've wondered, when I've been called ambitious, whether there's any acceptable way for a woman to desire, any way to say I want, where the object is anything besides a man or a baby, and not have it be perceived as a threat.\par \par \uc2 When Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  was in Philadelphia for a fund-raiser in January, I brought my daughters, because this was history, and I wanted them to see it. Upstairs, we had our picture taken. The three of us had ended up in black-and-white dresses, and the candidate smiled at our outfits, as my 8-year-old said, ''I hope you win!''\par \par \uc2 Downstairs, in front of a crowd that had been waiting for hours, she looked understandably weary, and she sounded painfully hoarse while hitting talking points with grim precision: about how we need to build bridges, not walls, about how we must remain a land of hope, not fear.\par \par \uc2 I remember feeling frustrated; then feeling frustrated at my frustration, thinking that there's no good way for a woman to speak, no good way for a woman to be as a presidential candidate. Too loud and you're shouting; too soft and you're weak. Still, I wanted soaring oratory. I wanted a less flawed, less problematic candidate; one without baggage, questionable choices, a long, fraught history; a candidate whose rise had the whiff of legend or destiny, not grim inevitability.\par \par \uc2 Perhaps it's in there, somewhere. I'd look for it, as we strolled through the Italian Market, where the vendors from the ''Rocky'' films have been joined by Cambodian and Laotian and Vietnamese and immigrants from Puebla. We'd go to Capogiro for a scoop of salted caramel gelato, and then ditch the Secret Service, and walk to Rittenhouse Square.\par \par \uc2 We'd find a little girl, maybe riding a scooter around the goat statue, and \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  could tell her You can be anything you want when you grow up; you can be president, and it wouldn't be theoretical, or imaginary, it would be real, and it would be wonderful. She would talk about her own mother, or her daughter, or granddaughter, in a way that revealed the warm, relatable, down-to-earth woman that her staffers assure the world is in there.\par \par \uc2 I'll tell Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  that we're a city that loves fighters, heroes who get dropped to the canvas, spit blood in a bucket, and keep on slugging. Rocky lost his bout in the first film, and it wasn't until the third that he vanquished the flashy, trash-talking, spouse-taunting opponent played by Mr. T.\par \par \uc2 Maybe this is the place where the \uc2 Clinton\uc2  campaign will catch fire, hit its stride, find its voice. Maybe Philadelphia is where \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  find a way to rally the country to her cause, and sweep to victory in a surge of pride and excitement instead of plodding across the finish line. Maybe Philadelphia, a troubled city that's been written off, is where a battered contender can find that there's a chance, still, for magic.\par \par \uc2 Follow The \uc2 New York Times\uc2  Opinion section on \uc2 Facebook\uc2  and \uc2 Twitter\uc2  (@NYTopinion), and sign up for the Opinion Today newsletter.\par \par \uc2 Jennifer Weiner, the author of the forthcoming memoir ''Hungry Heart,'' is a contributing opinion writer.\par \par \uc2 DRAWING (DRAWING BY GREG PIZZOLI) \par \par \uc2 Document NYTF000020160725ec7p0005n\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

Leader Says Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  Won't Sway Working Class\b0\par\par\uc2 By MAGGIE HABERMAN \par \uc2 938 \uc2 words\par \uc2 25 July 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 The New York Times on the Web\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 As union officials convene at the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia, the president of the largest umbrella labor group in the United States is bracing for a battle against a Republican nominee who is making a direct appeal to union members.\par \par \uc2 In a wide-ranging interview about the 2016 presidential race, Richard L. Trumka, the president of the A.F.L.-C.I.O., spoke some of his warmest words about \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , the Democratic Party's presumptive nominee for president, and predicted that appeals from her Republican opponent, \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , would sound hollow to working-class voters.\par \par \uc2 ''I think she's running to change America, not to manage America,'' Mr. Trumka said, describing what he saw as a difference between the two. Asked if that meant he considered her to be an agent of change, he replied, ''I do.''\par \par \uc2 That is a case that Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  will seek to make herself at the convention, which will take place this week in a battleground state that the \uc2 Trump\uc2  campaign is seeking to put in play in the general \uc2 election\uc2  because of its density of working-class white voters, to whom he is directing his message.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Trumka is expected to address the convention on Monday.\par \par \uc2 He sat out the nominating fight between Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  and Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, but his organization endorsed her in June. He sees a campaign in which his members will play a definitive role, and in which they will not be swayed by Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's ''appropriation'' of their issues like opposition to trade deals.\par \par \uc2 ''This \uc2 election\uc2  is going to be about two things -- it's going to be about income inequality and raising wages,'' said Mr. Trumka, who is closely aligned with Senator Elizabeth Warren, Democrat of Massachusetts, and who has, for months, called on all candidates for president to address wage stagnation.\par \par \uc2 ''Union members are really going to drive the debate about writing new economic rules,'' Mr. Trumka said. ''That's the rise of \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  -- people who think the rules don't work for them.''\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's base of support is working-class white voters, and he plans to make an effort to win voters in Rust Belt states. The Republican nominee also has made a clear pitch for voters who backed Mr. Sanders, and this weekend he seized on the news of a leak of hacked emails from \uc2 Democratic National Committee\uc2  staff members who worked to thwart the senator.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Trumka predicted that Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's pitch would fall on deaf ears.\par \par \uc2 ''He doesn't appeal to the Sanders voters, because all of his solutions are at the other end of the spectrum, with one exception, and that's trade,'' Mr. Trumka said of Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's plans to address the economy.\par \par \uc2 ''I think he's tapped into the legitimate anger and frustration that's out there,'' Mr. Trumka said. ''He knows a great issue and a powerful issue and a powerful narrative when he sees it, and our narrative is very, very powerful.''\par \par \uc2 Mr. Trumka spoke before Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's announcement on Friday of her vice-presidential nominee, Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia. Like Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , Mr. Kaine supported the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade accord, which organized labor strongly opposes.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Kaine was not among those whom Mr. Trumka listed as strong choices for Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's ticket; he favored Ms. Warren and Senator Sherrod Brown of Ohio, another progressive who is a favorite of the Democratic base. But he argued that Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  had already proved she would be a reliable ally.\par \par \uc2 ''I think she had a very positive influence on the platform,'' Mr. Trumka said of the Democratic Party's statement of principles.\par \par \uc2 ''She's done a good job of highlighting her skills and her credentials and her strengths,'' he added. ''If you look at it dispassionately, there hasn't been anyone who has better qualifications to run for president in a number of decades. She knows things about foreign affairs that \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  hasn't even suspected.''\par \par \uc2 Mr. Sanders also ''did a great job in helping to shape the platform,'' Mr. Trumka said. ''I think we all come together now.''\par \par \uc2 He said there would be a focused effort to inform his members and other voters about Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's views.\par \par \uc2 ''He thinks our wages are too high. He thinks outsourcing is great. He thinks \uc2 Carl Icahn\uc2  will be a great Treasury secretary,'' Mr. Trumka said of the activist investor. ''There are still workers who remember all the jobs that Icahn destroyed.''\par \par \uc2 The labor federation will focus primarily on six states: Florida, Missouri, Nevada, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. All of those states are not only in play in the presidential race but have competitive races for Senate or governor, Mr. Trumka said.\par \par \uc2 With a large number of union households in most of those states, the labor group plans to run television and online advertisements to move voters, as well as registration drives.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Trumka said he was worried about Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's ''loose talk'' about racial divisions. ''That's not good for this country,'' he said.\par \par \uc2 He was confident that Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's history -- including making his company's products in places like China -- would leave a lasting mark with voters.\par \par \uc2 ''We don't have to distort \uc2 Trump\uc2 's record,'' Mr. Trumka said. ''He will hang himself.''\par \par \uc2 Find out what you need to know about the 2016 presidential race today, and get politics news updates via \uc2 Facebook\uc2 , \uc2 Twitter\uc2  and the First Draft newsletter.\par \par \uc2 Document NYTF000020160725ec7p0005l\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 National Desk; SECTA\par \b \uc2 How Can \uc2 Clinton\uc2  Sell Herself to Voters Who Already Know Her?\b0\par\par\uc2 By ADAM NAGOURNEY \par \uc2 1,549 \uc2 words\par \uc2 25 July 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 11\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 PHILADELPHIA -- Few conventions were as successful as when Democrats gathered in 1992 in New York to nominate \uc2 Bill \uc2 Clinton\uc2  for president. There was the Hollywood-produced ''Man From Hope'' video. A dramatic Midtown Manhattan stroll by Bill and \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  from \uc2 Macy's\uc2  to Madison Square Garden. And a six-day post-convention bus caravan that drew crowds all the way through its end in St. Louis.\par \par \uc2 As Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  arrives here for her own nominating convention, she faces many of the same problems her husband encountered in 1992: She, too, is damaged after a bruising campaign and shadowed by a cloud of mistrust stirred by her actions. While Mr. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  was a relatively new if battered face, ready for his reintroduction in 1992, Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  is a political institution. With one exception, she has spoken at every Democratic National Convention since 1996.\par \par \uc2 ''If you don't know the Clintons by now, you are never going to know them,'' said \uc2 Newt Gingrich\uc2 , a former House speaker.\par \par \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2  entered the Republican National Convention last week in Cleveland with the opportunity to recast the way Americans viewed him, a moment he arguably failed to seize, but Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's task in Philadelphia is decidedly harder. She has been a fixture on the American political scene for a generation, subjected to endless attacks, examination and analysis. She is a proxy in debates over feminism and political power and a recurring subject of parody on ''Saturday Night Live.'' Views about her -- particularly on issues of trust after the F.B.I. investigation into her handling of emails as secretary of state -- are seared in place with many voters, pollsters say. After 25 years, her days of reinventing herself are almost surely gone.\par \par \uc2 And yet these four nights in the public eye, particularly coming after Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's often chaotic convention in Cleveland, offer her a chance to persuade important segments of the electorate to take another look at her, to consider parts of her life that have been lost in the glare of scandals and investigation, and to judge her candidacy in contrast with the dark image Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  presented last week of himself and the nation.\par \par \uc2 That would start with supporters of Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, many of whom, particularly younger ones, learned much of what they know about Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  through the prism of Mr. Sanders's attacks and have been steadfast in their opposition to her -- potentially all the more so after her choice of Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia, a moderate, as her running mate.\par \par \uc2 But just as crucially, Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  might also find an audience with independent voters struggling between two candidates they do not like, who will have an opportunity after this week to make a direct comparison between the visions being offered by Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  and Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 For nearly a year, Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  has struggled to answer questions about her use of a private email server, particularly after her conduct was excoriated by the F.B.I.; Republicans have accused her of negligence, criminal mishandling of classified information and even treason. Rightly or wrongly, the most recent controversy is what has defined her most.\par \par \uc2 ''She is someone with a long record in public life, but people forget,'' said David Greenberg, a history and journalism professor at Rutgers University. ''Younger voters, who don't have the memory -- or older voters with short memories.''\par \par \uc2 From that perspective, there is much that Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  may be able to do as she controls the convention stage for the next four nights.\par \par \uc2 A parade of Democratic stars, including a sitting president, a former president and Mr. Sanders, stand ready to offer a remedial course in \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 . ''We have a cavalry who are fully armed,'' said \uc2 David Plouffe\uc2 , who managed \uc2 Barack Obama\uc2 's campaign in 2008. ''For \uc2 Trump\uc2 , it was all on him.''\par \par \uc2 Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  also has the advantages of following the turbulent Republican gathering and of having a team far more experienced than Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's at producing sophisticated conventions, giving her an opportunity to contrast a presumably more united party and a more consistent message with what was displayed in Cleveland.\par \par \uc2 Rob Reiner, a Hollywood director and actor, who is a longtime supporter of Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , said she should use the convention to tell the story of her life. ''She has been an advocate her entire life for women, for children, for all the causes that we care about,'' he said.\par \par \uc2 ''I know she has a lot of baggage and all that stuff,'' he added. ''But a lot of that is unfair.''\par \par \uc2 So what might Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  do?\par \par \uc2 Uniting the party is the easy part. Yes, she needs to galvanize her party entering the general \uc2 election\uc2  -- and Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  may be aided greatly both by Mr. Sanders, who is set to trumpet his endorsement of her, and by Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , who has proved to be a great mobilizing force for Democrats.\par \par \uc2 But unity is not enough. Considering the passion that Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's supporters have shown, Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  -- who is not known for her ability to light up a room -- would be well advised to figure out a way to have Democrats, to borrow a phrase, fired up and ready to go.\par \par \uc2 ''The one thing that needs to happen coming out of the Democratic convention is for the Obama coalition being very enthused about her candidacy -- not just beating \uc2 Trump\uc2 ,'' Mr. Plouffe said. ''She has to give a speech that makes people as excited about her as they are about beating \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2 .''\par \par \uc2 Senator \uc2 Chuck Schumer\uc2  of New York, a Democrat who served with Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  in the Senate, said the convention would offer her an opportunity to debunk what he called the conservative caricature of her.\par \par \uc2 ''The right-wing media has tried to portray her as something she's not,'' Mr. Schumer said. ''The convention is a great way to undo some of that media image. People will see her up close. They will see her the way she is. I think their minds are open.''\par \par \uc2 Age is a virtue. The demographic differences between \uc2 Clinton\uc2  and Sanders supporters underline one of Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's biggest challenges: He crushed her among younger voters, whom she will need in November. The convention will give her a shot at winning them back.\par \par \uc2 Even before arriving here, Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  had taken steps to close that gap by, among other things, moving toward Mr. Sanders's position in favor of free tuition at public colleges.\par \par \uc2 There are other ways she can extend her appeal.\par \par \uc2 ''Eighty percent of her speakers should be under 40,'' Mr. Gingrich said. ''She has to convince the younger generation that she is an acceptable leader for that generation.''\par \par \uc2 Younger voters have much to learn about Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , be it her record in the Senate or her years as first lady. (An added bonus for Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 : Many of them have managed to come this far in life without knowing the political meaning of the word ''Whitewater.'')\par \par \uc2 One thing to watch: whether Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  avoids decades-old references, like her reaching back to ''voodoo economics'' -- a 36-year-old attack line that George Bush used on Ronald Reagan -- at the event this month where Mr. Sanders endorsed her.\par \par \uc2 Do notforget \uc2 Trump\uc2 . Conventions are about drawing contrasts, and Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  has shown no reluctance to highlight her differences with Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 . Philadelphia will provide an enormous stage to refine those arguments and respond specifically to how Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  tried to sell himself to voters in Cleveland, particularly on immigration and the threats of terrorism and crime.\par \par \uc2 ''She's in a position where she can be the safer choice,'' said Stuart Stevens, a Republican consultant who ran \uc2 Mitt Romney\uc2 's campaign for president in 2012. ''In times of instability, voters tend to look for safety.''\par \par \uc2 And Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  will benefit from timing: If the back-to-back conventions somewhat resemble a slow-motion debate between the candidates, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  has had his say, and Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  can make a closing argument that, if done right, could stick in the minds of many voters.\par \par \uc2 ''For her, the convention speech is the opportunity to have the final two words of the summer political season,'' said \uc2 Steve Schmidt\uc2 , a senior adviser to \uc2 John McCain\uc2  when he ran for president in 2008. ''The race is going to freeze in place a couple of weeks after those conventions.''\par \par \uc2 Find out what you need to know about the 2016 presidential race today, and get politics news updates via \uc2 Facebook\uc2 , \uc2 Twitter\uc2  and the First Draft newsletter.\par \par \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , at a rally on Friday in Tampa, Fla., is set to become the Democratic presidential nominee at the party's convention in Philadelphia.

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 WASHINGTON -- \uc2 Barr Pharmaceuticals\uc2  gave Gov. Tim Kaine of Virginia a ride on a private jet to a meeting in Aspen, Colo., at a time in 2006 when it was lobbying him over issues related to its drug sales, state records show.\par \par \uc2 Dominion Resources\uc2 , Virginia's largest electric utility and a lobbying force in the state's capital, Richmond, picked up the tab for a trip that Mr. Kaine took that same year to the college basketball Final Four tournament (and a funeral) in Indianapolis, according to the records.\par \par \uc2 McCandlish Holton PC, a law and lobbying firm that represented Virginia's small vineyards and worked closely with Mr. Kaine's office to create a new system for distributing wine produced by the vineyards, presented Mr. Kaine with four cases of wine in 2007, the records show, the same year he signed the legislation into law.\par \par \uc2 Under Virginia's lax ethics rules at the time, the gifts, which had a total value of more than $160,000, were all legal as long as they were disclosed.\par \par \uc2 But with Mr. Kaine's selection on Friday as \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's vice-presidential running mate, the gifts he received in the four years he served as Virginia's chief executive and his time as lieutenant governor before that are certain to be cited by his Republican critics as a sign that Mr. Kaine, who is now a United States senator, is not as squeaky clean as he portrays himself.\par \par \uc2 ''It would be na\u239\'00\'EFve to think a pharmaceutical company like Teva was not interested in maintaining access to the governor as a result of a gift of that size,'' said Andrew P. Miller, a former Democratic attorney general in Virginia, who now works as an energy industry lawyer and lobbyist, referring to \uc2 Teva Pharmaceuticals\uc2 , which bought Barr in 2008.\par \par \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , the Republican presidential nominee, wasted little time in starting to attack Mr. Kaine, branding him on Friday night as ''corrupt Kaine'' and continuing with the criticism during a Sunday morning news interview.\par \par \uc2 ''He took over $160,000 of gifts. And they said, well they weren't really gifts. They were suits, and trips and lots of different things. Over $160,000,'' Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  said on NBC's ''Meet the Press.'' ''I think to me it is a big problem.''\par \par \uc2 Mr. Kaine's acceptance of gifts has been reported on at times, dating back to when he was in the governor's office. But an examination by The \uc2 New York Times\uc2  of archival email traffic from Mr. Kaine's tenure as governor shows that he received gifts, in some cases, around the same time he and his staff were considering official government requests from these donors.\par \par \uc2 In Barr's case, the email records show that executives from the company asked Mr. Kaine to intervene with the Food and Drug Administration on its behalf in August 2006, just days before the flight to Aspen for a meeting of the \uc2 Democratic Governors Association\uc2 , later valued at $12,000 in Mr. Kaine's disclosure report.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Kaine signed the letter to the F.D.A. -- a draft of which had been written by Barr -- as requested before leaving on the trip, and a company lobbyist suggested that he was prepared to follow up during the plane ride.\par \par \uc2 ''The Gov will be on a plane on Friday with Phil Smith,'' Eileen Filler-Corn, an aide to the governor, wrote in an August 2006 email, after she had met with Mr. Smith, then a lobbyist from Barr. ''Phil will likely speak with to Gov about him sending a letter in support of the petition in Aspen this weekend, hence this email to ya'll.''\par \par \uc2 State records compiled by the \uc2 Virginia Public Access Project\uc2  show that a total of 139 companies or individuals gave about 220 gifts or reimbursements for travel to Mr. Kaine to work-related conferences while he served as governor from 2006 to 2010 and lieutenant governor from 2002 to 2006. Amy Dudley, a spokeswoman for Mr. Kaine, said that two-thirds of the filings were in the work-related travel category, and that Mr. Kaine was careful to disclose any gift, even if it was from a family friend, which is not required under the law.\par \par \uc2 She rejected any suggestion that Mr. Kaine may have done anything to benefit any individual or company that had given him a gift, including Teva, which sells generic drugs and has a large manufacturing plant in Forest, Va.\par \par \uc2 ''Many governors at the time believed, as then-Governor Kaine did, that more widespread use of generic drugs would reduce state and federal health care costs without compromising the quality of care,'' Ms. Dudley said.\par \par \uc2 The issue of gifts to elected officials has become particularly delicate in Virginia in the aftermath of the criminal case against Mr. Kaine's successor, Bob McDonnell, which was filed in 2014, even though his conviction was vacated late last month by the \uc2 United States Supreme Court\uc2 . Mr. McDonnell took much more extravagant gifts -- including a Rolex watch and catering for his daughter's wedding and other gifts and loans worth $177,000 -- from a single businessman who was seeking help with a state government-related matter, and Mr. McDonnell did not disclose all of those gifts.\par \par \uc2 Until the Virginia General Assembly moved last year to tighten state ethics laws -- prohibiting any single lobbyist, in most circumstances, from giving an elected official more than $100 in gifts each year -- it was common practice for state lawmakers to accept gifts, at times worth more than $10,000.\par \par \uc2 The largest proportion of the gifts that Mr. Kaine received was for political and campaign-related travel, including the $45,075 it cost for him to campaign around the country in 2008 for Barack Obama.\par \par \uc2 Other major gifts came from personal friends, including a weeklong stay, worth $18,000, in 2005 shortly after Mr. Kaine was elected governor on the exclusive Caribbean island of Mustique, provided by James B. Murray Jr., a Virginia-based venture capitalist specializing in telecommunications investments, who also donated $45,000 to Mr. Kaine's \uc2 election\uc2  campaign and to a political action committee affiliated with Mr. Kaine. Mr. Murray owned an oceanside estate named Les Jolies Eaux -- which boasts five bedrooms, two pools and, at least nowadays, a chef, butler, housekeeper, maid and gardener, according to a rental listing -- that was designed for Princess Margaret, countess of Snowdon, the younger daughter of King George VI and Queen Elizabeth.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Kaine, state records show, was meticulous at filing his gift disclosures, and even listed a set of cuff links -- worth $75 -- that he was given in 2006 by officials from Kent County, England, to help commemorate the 400th anniversary of the founding of Jamestown, Va., the first permanent English-speaking settlement in America.\par \par \uc2 Other small gifts came from President Hamid Karzai of Afghanistan (a 3-foot-by-5-foot prayer rug worth $345) and a signed baseball (worth $500) from the Cal Ripken Sr. Foundation.\par \par \uc2 Wayne Turnage, who served as Mr. Kaine's chief of staff, said his boss did not ask for most of the gifts and gave many away at the end of his term.\par \par \uc2 ''None of these gifts came with any hint of quid pro quo,'' he said.\par \par \uc2 But the emails reviewed by The Times reflect a sensitivity about the gifts and the public's perception of them on the part of Mr. Kaine's aides.\par \par \uc2 When Mr. Kaine's press secretary in December 2009 took a newspaper reporter and photographer to a so-called gift room in Capitol Square in Richmond, senior staff members scrambled to quickly end the session. A few days earlier, the governor had proposed an income tax increase, increasing staff members' anxiety about the appearance of an article focusing on gifts.\par \par \uc2 ''This is a terrible story,'' Lynda Tran, Mr. Kaine's communications director, wrote to Mr. Turnage, then the governor's chief of staff. ''I would certainly not have advised depicting the governor as hoarding gifts in a room.''\par \par \uc2 In some case, the gifts came from people or companies that were actively lobbying the state on matters in which Mr. Kaine's office was involved.\par \par \uc2 At the time McCandlish Holton, the Richmond-based law and lobbying firm, gave Mr. Kaine four cases of wine, it represented the Virginia Wineries Association and worked closely with Mr. Kaine's office to negotiate a compromise between the vineyards and wine wholesalers that resulted in legislation passed in 2007 and signed by Mr. Kaine, said Terri Cofer Beirne, the lobbyist who handled the matter.\par \par \uc2 ''He was quite helpful,'' Ms. Beirne said of Mr. Kaine and his staff.\par \par \uc2 This was hardly a new relationship: Mr. Kaine had worked at the law firm before he was elected lieutenant governor. The email records show several email exchanges between Ms. Beirne and Mr. Kaine's staff, as the industry worked to enact the provisions detailed in the new law, necessary after a court ruling declaring Virginia farm winery laws unconstitutional.\par \par \uc2 ''While it is informal and just a draft, it provides you with the information necessary to update the Governor on this effort,'' Ms. Beirne wrote in an email to two of Mr. Kaine's top aides in August 2007, several months after Mr. Kaine signed the law.\par \par \uc2 Disclosure reports filed by Mr. Kaine show that at some point in 2007 -- the day is not listed -- the law firm gave him the cases of wine, worth a total of $700.\par \par \uc2 Ms. Beirne said she did not recall the gift, but was certain it was not a ''thank you'' in return for the governor's help on the wine legislation.\par \par \uc2 ''We have had some stuff in Virginia along those lines that has been questionable. But he is not that kind of guy,'' she said. ''He does what is right.''\par \par \uc2 Barr Pharmaceuticals\uc2  provided at least two flights to Mr. Kaine while he was governor, including the Aspen trip to the Democratic governors meeting and another to Kansas in 2008, which was disclosed through a political action committee tied to Mr. Kaine.\par \par \uc2 Before the Kansas flight, the governor's aides received a request from Barr's chief executive for time with the governor to discuss pending legislation, an email shows. The same email among aides mentioned the upcoming plane ride to Kansas courtesy of Barr.\par \par \uc2 ''The ability to fly on a private aircraft saves the state money,'' Ms. Dudley said, adding that the trips were generally for state government-related matters.\par \par \uc2 Madeline I Abbitt, then a lobbyist for Barr, said that the company supported Mr. Kaine because of his work to help business in the state, not because of any particular actions he took on behalf of Barr.\par \par \uc2 ''He could make jobs in Virginia happen,'' she said.\par \par \uc2 A spokeswoman from Teva declined to comment because most of the dealings with Mr. Kaine came before Teva's purchase of Barr.\par \par \uc2 The trip paid for by Dominion in April 2006 allowed Mr. Kaine to attend the \uc2 N.C.A.A\uc2 . basketball tournament in Indianapolis as well as a funeral there for a former state legislator, records show.\par \par \uc2 ''We fully reported it and expected nothing in return,'' Chet G. Wade, a Dominion spokesman, said in a statement.\par \par \uc2 After he was elected to the Senate, Mr. Kaine publicly urged the Virginia legislature to tighten state ethics laws, saying he had concluded that the more stringent rules in Congress were appropriate.\par \par \uc2 ''The new year presents a superb opportunity to fix a major Virginia weakness: our lax ethical laws,'' he wrote in an op-ed article published on Dec. 31, 2013, in The \uc2 Washington Post\uc2 . ''Gifts to elected officials can create a subconscious sense of gratitude in even the most upright public servants.''\par \par \uc2 Tim Kaine, tapped by Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  to be her running mate, took gifts valued at more than $160,000.

\par\par \uc2 LETTER FROM WASHINGTON\par \uc2 National Desk; SECT\par \b \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's Candidacy Defined by Conflicting Portraits\b0\par\par\uc2 By ALBERT R. HUNT | BLOOMBERG VIEW \par \uc2 664 \uc2 words\par \uc2 25 July 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 The New York Times on the Web\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  has been a national political figure for a quarter-century, longer than any presidential candidate ever. Yet contradictions and conflicting portraits of her persist.\par \par \uc2 She is smart and well-versed in domestic and foreign policy issues, revels in working things out and commands strong loyalty. But she can also appear to some to be overly suspicious, insular, often nontransparent, and prone to cutting corners. She has a history of reaching across the partisan divide, yet, as we saw at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland last week, she is despised by many in the opposing party.\par \par \uc2 Comparisons inevitably are made with her husband, \uc2 Bill \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , and President Obama. She lacks her husband's keen political instincts and persuasive talents as a campaigner. But she is more direct and disciplined.\par \par \uc2 Representative \uc2 Peter King\uc2 , a New York Republican who knows both Clintons, says he sees another difference: ''Hillary listens.'' In contrast with Mr. Obama, she is much more interested in the mechanics of governance and politics. She lacks his ability to inspire and embrace bolder agendas.\par \par \uc2 The questions over the 15 weeks until \uc2 Election\uc2  Day will focus on her philosophy, experience, judgment and, if \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2  has his way, integrity.\par \par \uc2 During this campaign, every reliable fact-checker has found she has been much more truthful than Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Yet, too often, she seems to convey a sense that she feels above normal rules. Her use of a private email server while secretary of state was not, as the F.B.I. concluded, a prosecutable offense. It was ''extremely careless,'' as the F.B.I.'s director, James Comey, declared.\par \par \uc2 On domestic issues and the economy, she is as liberal as Mr. Obama. She will stress proposals such as public-private partnerships. More important, she'll be willing to cut deals. As a senator, she forged relations with Republican colleagues like the maverick \uc2 John McCain\uc2  and the conservative Trent Lott.\par \par \uc2 ''She has a real appreciation of how to work across the aisle,'' says \uc2 Tom Daschle\uc2 , the former Senate Democratic leader.\par \par \uc2 On foreign policy she is more hawkish than Mr. Obama. She supported the Iraq war, led the international effort to intervene in Libya -- according to a book by Jonathan Allen, she once thought the latter would be her ''signature issue'' -- and wants a more robust policy in Syria.\par \par \uc2 She is loath to admit mistakes. It took her years to acknowledge that the Iraq war vote was wrong. She still gets defensive about Libya, even though it has become a terrorist haven and Mr. Obama has expressed regret. (Among the gifts that her Republican opponents have given her is focusing on the tragedy at the diplomatic outpost in Benghazi, for which she was found to bear no responsibility, and letting her off the hook for the overall Libya policy.)\par \par \uc2 As secretary of state, she competently handled many challenges, but her tenure produced no big accomplishments or evidence to distinguish her as a major strategic thinker. Michael E. O'Hanlon, a national security scholar at the \uc2 Brookings Institution\uc2 , says her record was ''more solid than spectacular.''\par \par \uc2 If elected president, she'll be sure to name superb talents for substantive posts. Before his death in 2010, she was a champion of Richard C. Holbrooke, a brilliant foreign policy strategist who was known to be difficult. She would put a special emphasis on the most qualified women, perhaps persuading the secretary of health and human services, Sylvia Mathews Burwell, to move over to Treasury -- anyone from Wall Street is a political nonstarter -- and maybe tapping the national security expert Mich\u232\'00\'E8le A. Flournoy for defense secretary.\par \par \uc2 Whether Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  would find equally able White House aides of the kind who might challenge her -- the ''two or three sons of bitches'' that John F. Kennedy said a president needs -- rather than just longtime loyalists is a private concern of prominent Democrats who support her.\par \par \uc2 Document NYTF000020160725ec7p0004b\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 National Desk; SECTA\par \b \uc2 Live Videos, Small Screens: Campaigns Hope Voters Like What They See\b0\par\par\uc2 By MICHAEL D. SHEAR and NICK CORASANITI \par \uc2 1,325 \uc2 words\par \uc2 25 July 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 12\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 WASHINGTON -- The credentialed journalists and political pundits who have descended this week on Philadelphia for the Democratic National Convention will be joined by a team of campaign correspondents who will broadcast behind-the-scenes video over social media, interviewing party luminaries and convention delegates for a show called ''DNC Live.''\par \par \uc2 The show, which will be available on smartphones and tablets without interruption, will also feature celebrity guest commentators analyzing \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's speech. Though it may resemble standard political fare, the new media start-up responsible for the program -- Studio 2016 -- is an in-house production unit run by the \uc2 Clinton\uc2  campaign and the \uc2 Democratic National Committee\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 The creation of a team to produce original content that resembles news coverage is the latest attempt by a presidential candidate to bypass major news networks and speak directly to voters. By harnessing social media platforms to distribute hours of live video to hundreds of millions of potential followers, the \uc2 Clinton\uc2  campaign is poised to deliver a convention message more fully under its control.\par \par \uc2 ''Everything we do for the convention, this four-day sprint, is about trying to bring people in, trying to engage people, trying to speak directly to them,'' said Teddy Goff, the campaign's chief digital strategist.\par \par \uc2 Advances in technology, especially in live, high-definition streaming video, have allowed campaigns to reach people who may not be tuning in to network coverage. Just four years ago, social networks like \uc2 Twitter\uc2  and \uc2 Facebook\uc2  offered what digital specialists called a ''second-screen experience.'' Watching a convention speech typically required a standard television set, and apps on smartphones or computers were mostly used to react on social networks.\par \par \uc2 Now, viewers -- and not just young ones -- can ditch the television entirely and watch the convention on a smaller, portable screen. That provides an opportunity that political campaigns are seizing to connect directly with voters without having to suffer through analysis and criticism from journalists and pundits.\par \par \uc2 ''Part of what you want to do is shape the conversation that's happening, and you want to give tools to your supporters to spread the message,'' said Dan Pfeiffer, a former senior adviser to President Obama who used similar approaches while he was in the White House.\par \par \uc2 ''You want to expose it to as many people as possible, either in the moment or afterward, with context that you provide,'' Mr. Pfeiffer said.\par \par \uc2 Republicans, too, have seized on live video as a tool for shaping their message. In Cleveland, the Republicans offered all of the convention speeches over the major social media networks. \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's campaign organized live video from backstage, some of it delivered on Snapchat and other social networks.\par \par \uc2 ''Less and less people are watching live television,'' said Sam Osborne, the digital director for the Republican National Convention. Politicians who do not use live video delivered on phones and tablets, he said, ''will not get your message out to the people that you need to reach.''\par \par \uc2 The idea for the Democrats' show built off a one-hour show that they produced at the convention four years ago, hosted by the actor Kal Penn of the ''Harold and Kumar'' movies. Laura Olin, a Democratic digital strategist, said the video show was cutting-edge at the time. This year, instead of just one hour of programming, there will be four days of content.\par \par \uc2 ''It will be at a level that we have never seen before,'' Ms. Olin said.\par \par \uc2 The difference largely has to do with vast advances in technology, networks and social media apps. \uc2 Facebook\uc2  and \uc2 Twitter\uc2  have overhauled their apps to focus on live video, and other companies that focus on using video, like Snapchat, have emerged in recent years.\par \par \uc2 Facebook\uc2  introduced \uc2 Facebook\uc2  Live this year, and has partnered with campaigns and news media organizations to produce content. For the conventions, the company is using the live-streams of news outlets and the parties held during the events as a way of bringing the programming of the conventions to users' screens.\par \par \uc2 Twitter\uc2  is planning a similar effort with live broadcasting. In addition to its Periscope app, the company has introduced a new live-streaming video platform that teams up with broadcasters to provide high-definition video for \uc2 Twitter\uc2  users on the platform's app or website. For the convention broadcasts, \uc2 Twitter\uc2  became partners with \uc2 CBS News\uc2 . Alongside the stream, \uc2 Twitter\uc2  users will be able to send out posts and read their own feeds.\par \par \uc2 ''It's a recognition that often people are tweeting as they watch something on TV, so the hope is this is one experience,'' said Nick Pacilio, a Twitter spokesman.\par \par \uc2 The presidential campaigns have fully embraced digital media as a central part of their messaging and organizing strategy. In June, at a senior-level planning meeting at Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's headquarters in Brooklyn, members of the digital team almost jokingly proposed an online contest to select a constituent to have a role at the Democratic convention. The campaign's top strategists immediately agreed.\par \par \uc2 The campaign has also invited celebrity supporters to use social media as an organizing tool in a nationwide effort to register three million voters. And Mr. Goff said the campaign was using its digital media presence to bolster its collection of email addresses and other valuable information about voters.\par \par \uc2 Smartphones, and the extensive use of social media by campaigns to communicate directly with voters, often provide a view into places that previously would have gone unseen because of limited access of the news media, especially at conventions. \uc2 Instagram\uc2 's Backstage Portrait Studio at both conventions captures the final moments before a speaker, or eventually the candidate, takes the stage.\par \par \uc2 And Snapchat has proved unusually adept at gaining behind-the-scenes access at closed-door events like fund-raisers. Delegates, campaign aides and convention officials used the platform at the Republican convention, and the company expects the same among Democrats in Philadelphia.\par \par \uc2 For those who attend the conventions in person, the most prominent social media platforms have been at least as visible as the broadcast television and cable networks.\par \par \uc2 The bright royal blue hue of \uc2 Facebook\uc2  dominated large spaces in the convention hall and news media filing centers, providing coffee, snacks and real-time data for journalists and, for delegates and convention attendees, hands-on trials of the company's virtual reality product Oculus. \uc2 Facebook\uc2  also built a studio adjacent to the arena to allow its news partners, including The \uc2 New York Times\uc2 , to produce live segments.\par \par \uc2 Twitter\uc2  has booths scattered around the convention site, but is also focusing offsite. As it did last week in Cleveland, the company is renting out restaurants and event spaces to host meetings and panel discussions on the platform's role in the \uc2 election\uc2 , with topics like #BlackTwitter and women in politics.\par \par \uc2 But for the \uc2 Clinton\uc2  campaign, the goal of these efforts is to reach an audience well beyond Philadelphia.\par \par \uc2 A campaign spokesman said that what he called ''gavel-to-gavel coverage'' of the convention would be distributed to viewers on Apple TV, Amazon Fire and Roku, in addition to \uc2 Facebook\uc2 , \uc2 Twitter\uc2  and Snapchat.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Goff said that Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's strategists were not ignoring the traditional broadcast and cable networks. But he noted that 2014 was the first year that Americans, in aggregate, had spent more time in front of their smartphone screens than they did in front of their television screens.\par \par \uc2 ''TV is still really important,'' Mr. Goff said. ''But things are changing really quickly.''\par \par \uc2 Find out what you need to know about the 2016 presidential race today, and get politics news updates via \uc2 Facebook\uc2 , \uc2 Twitter\uc2  and the First Draft newsletter.\par \par \uc2 Viewers of the Democratic National Convention, to be held at the Wells Fargo Center in Philadelphia, above, will be able to watch the event on phones and tablets.

\par\par \uc2 National Desk; SECTA\par \b \uc2 Leaks Bring Down a Democratic Leader\b0\par\par\uc2 By JONATHAN MARTIN and ALAN RAPPEPORT; Maggie Haberman, Trip Gabriel and Yamiche Alcindor contributed reporting. \par \uc2 1,707 \uc2 words\par \uc2 25 July 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 1\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 PHILADELPHIA -- Democrats arrived at their nominating convention on Sunday under a cloud of discord as \uc2 Debbie Wasserman Schultz\uc2 , the chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee, abruptly said she was resigning after a trove of leaked emails showed party officials conspiring to sabotage the campaign of Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont.\par \par \uc2 The revelation, along with sizable pro-Sanders protests here in the streets to greet arriving delegates, threatened to undermine the delicate healing process that followed the contentious fight between Mr. Sanders and \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 . And it raised the prospect that a convention that was intended to showcase the Democratic Party's optimism and unity, in contrast to the Republicans, could be marred by dissension and disorder.\par \par \uc2 The day also veered extraordinarily into allegations, not easily dismissed, that Russia had a hand in the leaks that helped bring down the head of an American political party.\par \par \uc2 Despite those concerns, Democrats are hoping that focusing on \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , the Republican nominee, will galvanize the party to rally around Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , and on Sunday those efforts received a major boost when \uc2 Michael R. Bloomberg\uc2 , the former Republican and independent mayor of New York, said he would endorse her.\par \par \uc2 In her resignation statement, Ms. Wasserman Schultz, a representative from Florida, said she would continue to fight for Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  from the sidelines.\par \par \uc2 ''I know that electing \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  as our next president is critical for America's future,'' Ms. Wasserman Schultz said in a statement. ''I look forward to serving as a surrogate for her campaign in Florida and across the country to ensure her victory.''\par \par \uc2 She added, ''Going forward, the best way for me to accomplish those goals is to step down as party chair at the end of this convention.''\par \par \uc2 Donna Brazile, a vice chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee, will be the interim chairwoman through the \uc2 election\uc2 , the committee said.\par \par \uc2 Ms. Wasserman Schultz has faced a flurry of negative stories during her five-year tenure as the committee's chairwoman, with critics charging that she was more focused on promoting her career than on the party, but she had resisted calls to quit.\par \par \uc2 Ms. Wasserman Schultz announced her resignation after a private meeting with advisers and senior aides to Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  at a hotel here a day before the party's convention was set to begin. She had faced growing calls for her resignation over the weekend.\par \par \uc2 ''In politics, you need to not only know when to draw your sword, but also when to fall on it,'' said James Carville, a longtime friend and adviser to the Clintons.\par \par \uc2 The breach of the Democratic committee's emails, made public on Friday by \uc2 WikiLeaks\uc2 , offered undeniable evidence of what Mr. Sanders's supporters had complained about for much of the senator's contentious primary contest with Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 : that the party was effectively an arm of Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's campaign. The messages showed members of the committee's communications team musing about pushing the narrative that the Sanders campaign was inept and trying to raise questions publicly about whether he was an atheist.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Sanders said the situation was an ''outrage'' on Sunday before the resignation was announced, and called for Ms. Wasserman Schultz to step down. Afterward, he said it was the right decision.\par \par \uc2 ''The party leadership must also always remain impartial in the presidential nominating process, something which did not occur in the 2016 race,'' he said in a statement.\par \par \uc2 Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's campaign aides ignored questions as they quickly left a hotel a few minutes after the resignation was announced. Ms. Brazile emerged soon after the \uc2 Clinton\uc2  aides had left and said in a brief interview that Ms. Wasserman Schultz had called her Sunday afternoon and asked her to come to the hotel where the Florida delegation was staying.\par \par \uc2 Convention organizers had expressed nervousness on Sunday about the specter of Ms. Wasserman Schultz appearing onstage at all during the four-day convention. They were worried that what they intended to be a well-choreographed event, which officials hoped would contrast with the sometimes chaotic Republican National Convention, could be marred by Mr. Sanders's backers booing and heckling her.\par \par \uc2 Ms. Wasserman Schultz recognized the magnitude of the problem on Saturday and initially planned to offer an apology, one of her advisers said. But it became clear to her on Sunday that contrition was insufficient.\par \par \uc2 Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's campaign handled the situation delicately, not wanting the chairwoman to feel intense pressure and dig in. The \uc2 Clinton\uc2  aides told Ms. Wasserman Schultz the choice to resign was hers to make, but they gently warned her that she would face jeers from Mr. Sanders's supporters this week in the convention hall, said the adviser to Ms. Wasserman Schultz, who requested anonymity to discuss private deliberations.\par \par \uc2 The nudge was enough to force Ms. Wasserman Schultz's hand.\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 Clinton\uc2  campaign also suggested on Sunday that Russia had been responsible for the leak as part of an effort to help Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , who has made flattering comments about President \uc2 Vladimir V. Putin\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 The convention will feature a host of prominent attendees, and Monday will be headlined by speeches by Mr. Sanders and \uc2 Michelle Obama\uc2 , the first lady. President Obama and former President \uc2 Bill \uc2 Clinton\uc2  will address the delegates later in the week, bringing the kind of presidential firepower that the Republican convention could not muster because of opposition to Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 The unexpected decision by Mr. Bloomberg to endorse Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  reflected his increasing dismay about the rise of Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Mr. Sanders's supporters were elated by Ms. Wasserman Schultz's decision, which they said had been long overdue.\par \par \uc2 ''Thank God for \uc2 WikiLeaks\uc2 ,'' said Dan O'Neal, a delegate from Arizona who was wearing a ''Bernie for President'' T-shirt. ''The party was stacked from the beginning with Debbie in charge.''\par \par \uc2 Benjamin T. Jealous, a frequent surrogate for Mr. Sanders and a former president of the N.A.A.C.P., said on Sunday in Philadelphia that the move ''allows us to heal and move on.''\par \par \uc2 But many of Mr. Sanders's backers were not ready to let go, and their frustration could be seen on the streets here. A large, boisterous crowd of his supporters, chanting ''hell, no, D.N.C., we won't vote for Hillary,'' marched toward the site of the Democratic National Convention on Sunday afternoon.\par \par \uc2 The crowd of more than 1,000 people from as far as Seattle and Florida was much larger than any of the protest marches last week in Cleveland during the Republican convention.\par \par \uc2 Further angering some members of the party's left was Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's selection of Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia as her running mate, a move that was widely heralded by establishment Democrats but that provoked some backlash on Sunday from members of the party who believed he was not sufficiently liberal.\par \par \uc2 After the announcement on Friday that Mr. Kaine was joining the ticket, some die-hard supporters of Mr. Sanders complained that the choice of a centrist Democrat was evidence that Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  had merely been paying lip service to the party's progressive wing. Many were hoping that she would select Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts or Senator Sherrod Brown of Ohio if Mr. Sanders were not the choice.\par \par \uc2 Norman Solomon, a delegate for Mr. Sanders who coordinates the Bernie Delegates Network, said that 90 percent of his delegates had found Mr. Kaine to be an ''unacceptable'' choice for vice president. Mr. Solomon's group arrived early in Philadelphia to make its displeasure known.\par \par \uc2 ''Secretary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  must know that her choice of Kaine can only inflame rather than soothe her relations with the huge constituency of Bernie supporters,'' he said.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Sanders was conspicuously quiet after the pick was announced before breaking his silence on Sunday in a \uc2 CNN\uc2  interview. While he spoke highly of Mr. Kaine, he made clear that they had big policy differences.\par \par \uc2 ''Are his political views different than mine? Yes, they are,'' Mr. Sanders said. ''He is more conservative than I am.''\par \par \uc2 Ms. Wasserman Schultz's decision to resign could help tamp down open dissent by Sanders delegates at the convention. Immediately after her announcement, top party leaders praised her work in an effort to show solidarity on the eve of the four-day event.\par \par \uc2 ''I am grateful to Debbie for getting the Democratic Party to this year's historic convention in Philadelphia, and I know that this week's events will be a success thanks to her hard work and leadership,'' Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  said.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Obama said in a statement, ''For the last eight years, Chairwoman \uc2 Debbie Wasserman Schultz\uc2  has had my back.''\par \par \uc2 As Democrats digested the news, Republicans gloated.\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 Republican National Committee\uc2  sent out headlines that depicted the Democratic Party in disarray.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , who spent much of the day egging on supporters of Mr. Sanders to revolt after the selection of Mr. Kaine, bragged on \uc2 Twitter\uc2  that he had always known Ms. Wasserman Schultz was ''overrated.''\par \par \uc2 I always said that \uc2 Debbie Wasserman Schultz\uc2  was overrated. The Dems Convention is cracking up and Bernie is exhausted, no energy left! -- \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2  (@realDonaldTrump) July 24, 2016\par \par \uc2 ''The Dems Convention is cracking up, and Bernie is exhausted, no energy left!'' Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  wrote.\par \par \uc2 The fallout from the resignation could jeopardize Ms. Wasserman Schultz's seat in Congress, as she faces Tim Canova, a law professor who supports Mr. Sanders, in a primary \uc2 election\uc2  next month.\par \par \uc2 Find out what you need to know about the 2016 presidential race today, and get politics news updates via \uc2 Facebook\uc2 , \uc2 Twitter\uc2  and the First Draft newsletter.\par \par \uc2 Protesters including backers of Senator Bernie Sanders on Sunday in Philadelphia, the site of the Democratic National Convention.

\par\par \uc2 National Desk; SECTA\par \b \uc2 Dismayed by \uc2 Trump\uc2 , Bloomberg Will Endorse \uc2 Clinton\b0\par\par\uc2 By ALEXANDER BURNS \par \uc2 994 \uc2 words\par \uc2 25 July 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 14\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Michael R. Bloomberg\uc2 , who bypassed his own run for the presidency this \uc2 election\uc2  cycle, will endorse \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  in a prime-time address at the Democratic National Convention and make the case for Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  as the best choice for moderate voters in 2016, an adviser to Mr. Bloomberg said.\par \par \uc2 The news is an unexpected move from Mr. Bloomberg, who has not been a member of the Democratic Party since 2000; was elected the mayor of New York City as a Republican; and later became an independent.\par \par \uc2 But it reflects Mr. Bloomberg's increasing dismay about the rise of \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2  and a determination to see that the Republican nominee is defeated.\par \par \uc2 Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  is seeking to reach out to middle-of-the-road swing voters and even moderate Republicans uneasy about Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 . Polls show that significant numbers of Republicans remain wary of Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , and question his fitness for the presidency.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Bloomberg will vouch for Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  ''from the perspective of a business leader and an independent,'' said Howard Wolfson, a senior adviser to Mr. Bloomberg.\par \par \uc2 ''As the nation's leading independent and a pragmatic business leader, Mike has supported candidates from both sides of the aisle,'' Mr. Wolfson said. ''This week in Philadelphia, he will make a strong case that the clear choice in this \uc2 election\uc2  is \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 .''\par \par \uc2 Mr. Bloomberg, who has been sharply critical of Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's views on immigration and the economy, may fortify Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's appeal to the political center.\par \par \uc2 And with the Republican nominee basing his campaign on his background as a businessman, Mr. Bloomberg, a billionaire media executive and philanthropist, may help counter the \uc2 Trump\uc2  sales pitch.\par \par \uc2 It is unusual, but not unheard-of, for a speaker who is not a member of a political party to address that party's convention. Mr. Bloomberg is expected to speak on Wednesday, the same evening as President Obama and Vice President \uc2 Joseph R. Biden Jr\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Mr. Bloomberg and Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  are not personally close but had a positive working relationship when he served as mayor and she as a senator from New York.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Wolfson said the \uc2 Clinton\uc2  campaign had contacted Mr. Bloomberg several weeks ago to ask if he would be willing to address the convention. Mr. Bloomberg, he said, mulled over the idea and ultimately agreed to speak, after drafting a speech that reflected his distinctive set of political views rather than a boilerplate Democratic message.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Wolfson also said Mr. Bloomberg was pleased by the selection of Senator Tim Kaine, a former governor of Virginia and a strong supporter of gun control, as Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's running mate.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Bloomberg is not an entirely natural fit for the Democratic Party of 2016: Though he has been an energetic advocate on issues related to guns, immigration and climate change, he has also been a vocal ally of the financial services industry and has defended the strict policing tactics his administration employed in New York.\par \par \uc2 Jennifer Palmieri, Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's communications director, said Mr. Bloomberg would bring to the convention ''a unique and important voice that lays out the choice in this \uc2 election\uc2 .''\par \par \uc2 ''As a business leader and philanthropist, \uc2 Michael Bloomberg\uc2  has lived his values and fought to make a difference for others,'' Ms. Palmieri said.\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 Trump\uc2  campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\par \par \uc2 In the past, Mr. Bloomberg has rebuked Democrats for attacking Wall Street -- a part of his record that may sit uneasily with liberal Democrats, and especially with the supporters of Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont who are already smarting from his defeat.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Bloomberg has been quiet in recent months about the presidential race. But in the past, he has criticized Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  in stark terms, describing him as a threat to American security.\par \par \uc2 When he decided late last winter not to run for the White House, Mr. Bloomberg explained that he could not take the risk of running an independent campaign that might inadvertently ease Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's path to power.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Bloomberg castigated Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  at the time for his proposals to ban Muslim immigration and deport millions of undocumented immigrants, as well as his pledge to launch trade wars with China and Japan.\par \par \uc2 ''These moves would divide us at home and compromise our moral leadership around the world,'' Mr. Bloomberg wrote. ''The end result would be to embolden our enemies, threaten the security of our allies, and put our own men and women in uniform at greater risk.''\par \par \uc2 In April, he warned in a commencement address at the \uc2 University of Michigan\uc2  that the country faced an unprecedented political threat from ''demagogues'' in both parties.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Bloomberg, who served for 12 years as the mayor of New York, has never addressed a political convention in a partisan capacity. He appeared at the 2004 Republican National Convention in New York in his role as mayor of the host city.\par \par \uc2 He endorsed Mr. Obama for re-\uc2 election\uc2  in 2012, writing in a column that his views on climate change had been the decisive factor.\par \par \uc2 Michael Nutter, a former Philadelphia mayor, said he expected Mr. Bloomberg to receive a ''warm and positive welcome'' from delegates, even though he is not a Democrat. Mr. Nutter said it made political sense to go after voters outside the party: Mr. Bloomberg, he said, could help persuade other business leaders to back Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , ''in some cases Republican business people.''\par \par \uc2 ''I think \uc2 Mike Bloomberg\uc2  gives validation to \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  and the campaign,'' said Mr. Nutter, a Democrat. ''We want to win, and everybody has a role to play.''\par \par \uc2 Find out what you need to know about the 2016 presidential race today, and get politics news updates via \uc2 Facebook\uc2 , \uc2 Twitter\uc2  and the First Draft newsletter.\par \par \uc2 Michael R. Bloomberg, an independent, is expected to speak at the Democratic convention.

BLOW \par \uc2 935 \uc2 words\par \uc2 25 July 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 23\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Following last week's Republican calamity in Cleveland, the Democratic National Convention rolls into Philadelphia on Monday with big opportunities and big challenges.\par \par \uc2 Many Democrats will come with enthusiasm, but also with reservations.\par \par \uc2 Unlike the Republican Convention's speaker lineup, which was backfilled with \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2 's children because there were so few party heavyweights to anchor it, the Democratic Convention will have a litany of A-listers: The president, the first lady, Bernie Sanders and former President \uc2 Bill \uc2 Clinton\uc2  among them.\par \par \uc2 These speakers will paint a vastly different picture of the country and its future than the unremittingly dark and dangerous one portrayed by the Republicans.\par \par \uc2 There will also likely be less acrimony in Philadelphia, as the Democrats review the failed stagecraft of Cleveland and work hard not to replicate it.\par \par \uc2 But, all is not roses for the Democrats.\par \par \uc2 The presumptive presidential nominee, \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , has a battered image -- partly due to a concerted effort by Republicans to batter it, and partly the result of her own poor choices. Two-thirds of registered voters don't believe that she's honest and trustworthy, and trustworthiness is one of those attributes that tends to be difficult to quickly and easily alter.\par \par \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's honesty numbers are even worse than \uc2 Trump\uc2 's, but not by much. They both have some unbelievable negatives. As The \uc2 New York Times\uc2  reported earlier this month:\par \par \uc2 ''In a development not seen in any modern presidential contest, more than half of all voters hold unfavorable views of the two major party candidates and large majorities say neither is honest and trustworthy. Only half of voters say Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  is prepared to be president, while an astonishing two-thirds say that Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  is not ready for the job -- including four in 10 Republicans.''\par \par \uc2 But, being about as bad as \uc2 Trump\uc2  is hardly a good thing. \uc2 Trump\uc2  is a horrible candidate who shouldn't have a shot, but in this race he does. Although \uc2 Clinton\uc2  remains the favorite to win in November, the race is too close for comfort. There are paths to victory -- uphill though they may be -- for \uc2 Trump\uc2  to win.\par \par \uc2 (Just typing that sent shivers down my spine. The idea that a man who used a racist attack on a judge in one of his own cases might get to pick the next one -- or even two or three -- Supreme Court justices is in itself unfathomable. The fact that he's even competitive makes me question the electoral competency of America.)\par \par \uc2 Too many voters find themselves in the worst possible position: They have a choice between a Republican of whom they are frightened and disgusted and a Democrat of whom they are leery and unenthused.\par \par \uc2 Last week \uc2 Clinton\uc2  had a chance to shake up the race with her vice-presidential pick, but instead she chose the safer route, choosing the Democratic centrist Tim Kaine.\par \par \uc2 Kaine has his virtues -- he is solid and affable, a solid liberal from the crucial state of Virginia -- but this is not the sort of pick that taps into the progressive populism sweeping the party or the expansive diversity that constitutes the party.\par \par \uc2 Kaine reinforces \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's ''steady hand'' message, but that is a message, however valid and necessary, that's completely devoid of sizzle.\par \par \uc2 Trump\uc2  is campaigning on fear, change and winning, all intense and even seductive ideas, even though his proposals are insular, unrealistic or hollow. ''Steady'' just doesn't have the same emotional appeal. And although I hate to boil a historic \uc2 election\uc2 , and monumental policy challenges, down to emotions, I've been around long enough to know that this sort of visceral sensibility can swing elections.\par \par \uc2 The Democrats also have to deal with the resurgent idea of a primary process and party apparatus that favored \uc2 Clinton\uc2  and wasn't completely fair to Sanders.\par \par \uc2 This was reignited in the conversation last week when \uc2 WikiLeaks\uc2  released nearly 20,000 internal emails from the \uc2 Democratic National Committee\uc2  in which some officers expressed antipathy and outright hostility to Sanders and his candidacy.\par \par \uc2 No matter whom one supported during the primaries, or even what party one aligns with, this should turn the stomach. This kind of collusion is precisely what is poisoning faith in our politics.\par \par \uc2 This reinforced the feeling of many that the system was rigged from the beginning.\par \par \uc2 CNN\uc2  reported on Sunday that in the wake of the scandal, the tainted party chairwoman, \uc2 Debbie Wasserman Schultz\uc2 , agreed to step down from her role at the conclusion of the convention.\par \par \uc2 But the injury is already inflicted.\par \par \uc2 These leaks further damage an already damaged faith in the Democratic nominating process. In March, the \uc2 Pew Research Center\uc2  found:\par \par \uc2 ''Forty two percent of Republican voters have a positive view of the primary process, compared with 30 percent of Democrats. The share of Democrats expressing a positive view of the primary process has declined 22 percentage points (from 52 percent) in February 2008. Republicans views are little different than in 2000 or 2008.''\par \par \uc2 What are those Democratic voters supposed to do who don't trust the candidate, the party or the process, even if they view The Donald as the Devil? This is one of the convention's conundrums.\par \par \uc2 I invite you to join me on \uc2 Facebook\uc2  and follow me on Twitter (@CharlesMBlow), or e-mail me at chblow@nytimes.com.\par \par \uc2 Follow The \uc2 New York Times\uc2  Opinion section on \uc2 Facebook\uc2  and Twitter (@NYTopinion), and sign up for the Opinion Today newsletter.\par \par \uc2 CHART: How Voters See \uc2 Clinton\uc2  (Source: New York Times/CBS News poll conducted July 8-12) \par \par \uc2 Document NYTF000020160725ec7p0003b\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw272\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4080\pichgoal600

Other GOP allies will hover around Philadelphia for counterprogramming during the Democratic gathering.\par \par \uc2 The Republican nominees in their travels will jointly appear at two town hall meetings, a rally, a national veterans' convention and what the campaign described as a Hispanic leadership round table.\par \par \uc2 The two men will then split up on the campaign trailas Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  takes the Philadelphia stage Thursday, aides to the New York businessman said. Mr. Pence will campaign with his wife, Karen.\par \par \uc2 Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  last week eschewed the tradition of letting the opposing party have the national stage during its convention, and campaigned in Ohio while the Republican gathering took place there. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  surrogates also traveled to Cleveland to push back against the frequent attacks on Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  at the GOP event.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , in an interview that aired Sunday on NBC, underscored how far he is willing to limit immigration as an antiterrorism tool. He said immigrants from close allies such as France might be subject to the "extreme vetting" he proposes for those from nations he deems "compromised by terrorism." A Bastille Day terror attack in Nice, France, earlier this month killed 84 people.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  was clarifying comments he made at the GOP convention that some interpreted as narrowing his past proposal to temporarily ban Muslims from entering the U.S. He more recently described a ban that looks not at religion but at what he says are the failures of countries to combat terrorism inside their borders.\par \par \uc2 "I actually don't think it's a rollback," Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  said. "In fact, you could say it's an expansion. I'm looking now at territory."\par \par \uc2 In coming weeks, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  told NBC, he would unveil a detailed list of countries and territories from which immigrants would be subject to "extreme vetting."\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  also threatened on NBC to pull the U.S. out of the \uc2 World Trade Organization\uc2  if membership in the global body interferes with his plan to impose penalties on companies that move U.S. production offshore.\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 WTO\uc2  threat appeared to mark a new level of attack on the global trading system that evolved in the postwar era. Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  previously denigrated the \uc2 North American Free Trade Agreement\uc2 , or Nafta, and a proposed Pacific trade pact.\par \par \uc2 In Philadelphia, national and state Republicanswere set to kick off their own messaging Sunday night, when Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus and \uc2 Trump\uc2  campaign Chairman \uc2 Paul Manafort\uc2  were on hand to talk to reporters.\par \par \uc2 The Pennsylvania GOP, meantime, is set to hold news conferences Tuesday and Wednesday to push back against Democrats, and flood call-in radio shows Thursday, a party spokeswoman said.\par \par \uc2 Republican attacks on Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  and the Democratic convention could help distract from lingering tensions within the GOP from Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's spats with primary-season rivals who declined to endorse him: Ohio Gov. John Kasich, who didn't attend the convention in his home state, and Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, who gave a convention speech and was booed off the stage when he didn't endorse Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  indicated he doesn't plan to let the issue lie. He told NBC that he would back efforts to defeat Messrs. Cruz and Kasich and a third Republican whom he didn't name by generating funds to oppose them.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Kasich won re-\uc2 election\uc2  to a four-year term in 2014, and since Ohio imposes a two-term limit on governorships, it isn't clear Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  will have an opportunity to back a Kasich challenger. Mr. Cruz was elected to a six-year Senate term in 2012.\par \par \uc2 ---\par \par \uc2 William Mauldin contributed to this article.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=wjco20160725000080"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document J000000020160725ec7p0001v\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw272\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4080\pichgoal600

\par\par \b \uc2 Democrats Seek Unity With Ouster\b0\par\par\uc2 By Laura Meckler and Janet Hook   \par \uc2 1,101 \uc2 words\par \uc2 25 July 2016\par \uc2 The Wall Street Journal\par \uc2 J\par A1\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 PHILADELPHIA -- Democrats gathering for their national convention began the process of unifying the party around \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  by forcing the resignation of a top party official viewed with bitter suspicion by primary runner-up Bernie Sanders.\par \par \uc2 The resignation of \uc2 Debbie Wasserman Schultz\uc2  as chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee came after the disclosure of a trove of hacked emails showing DNC officials working to undermine Mr. Sanders's campaign.\par \par \uc2 After hours of private talks, Ms. Wasserman Schultz, a congresswoman from Florida, said she would step down after the convention ends -- meaning she would still have to face pro-Sanders delegates when she takes on the traditional role of gaveling the opening and closing of the event. She will also speak at the convention.\par \par \uc2 Her departure removes what was becoming a major distraction on the eve of the Democratic National Convention, a four-day event aimed chiefly at re-introducing Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  to a general-\uc2 election\uc2  audience, hoping a telling of her life story and motivations will draw in voters who don't like the alternative, Republican \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 After Republicans gathered in Cleveland last week used criticism of Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  to rally their troops, Philadelphia also will feature a heavy dose of \uc2 Trump\uc2  attacks, officials said. But Democrats said their more urgent task is to pump up Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  and tell voters her story and motivations. She will be formally nominated as the first woman to lead a major party ticket on Tuesday, and accept with a prime-time speech Thursday.\par \par \uc2 The party also will seek to showcase her broad appeal with an endorsement from former New York City Mayor \uc2 Michael Bloomberg\uc2 , an independent and former Republican who considered a presidential run of his own this year. He will speak on Wednesday.\par \par \uc2 The intraparty fight over the DNC chairwoman, which risked muddying the party's messages, is now no longer much of a threat. The downside for the \uc2 Clinton\uc2  campaign is that it could appear to be buckling to the Sanders wing.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Sanders has long accused Ms. Wasserman Schultz of bias against him and had repeatedly called for her to step down. His allies had hoped the \uc2 Clinton\uc2  campaign would force her out in order to win Mr. Sanders's endorsement. But the \uc2 Clinton\uc2  team stuck by her and won his backing anyway, and it was thought that she would survive until her DNC term expires after the November \uc2 election\par \par \uc2 "My first priority has always been serving the people of the 23rd district of Florida and I look forward to continuing to do that as their member of Congress for years to come," Ms. Wasserman Schultz said in a statement announcing her resignation. She is facing a primary challenge in Florida from a well-funded law professor and activist endorsed by Mr. Sanders.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Sanders welcomed the move, praising the chairwoman's service but saying the party needs "new leadership."\par \par \uc2 "\uc2 Debbie Wasserman Schultz\uc2  has made the right decision for the future of the Democratic Party," he said in a statement. The party leadership must "always remain impartial in the presidential nominating process, something which did not occur in the 2016 race."\par \par \uc2 In a statement Sunday, Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  praised the chairwoman's service and promised to campaign for her this year. President \uc2 Barack Obama\uc2 , who appointed her to the job in 2011, also released a complimentary statement.\par \par \uc2 The move was welcomed by other party leaders who saw Ms. Wasserman Schultz as an unnecessary distraction, particularly in light of the new emails, which were disclosed on the \uc2 WikiLeaks\uc2  website.\par \par \uc2 "I love Debbie, and I think she's done a good job. But I think this was unconscionable and somebody has to be held accountable for it," said former Pennsylvania Gov. Ed Rendell, a former DNC chairman.\par \par \uc2 In one email to DNC officials, Chief Financial Officer Brad Marshall mused about ways to undermine Mr. Sanders. "Does he believe in a God. He had skated on saying he has a Jewish heritage. I think I read he is anatheist. This could make several points difference with my peeps."\par \par \uc2 Mr. Sanders called that missive and others "outrageous" and said he isn't an atheist in a \uc2 CNN\uc2  appearance Sunday. Mr. Marshall, in a \uc2 Facebook\uc2  post Saturday, apologized, saying it didn't reflect his beliefs.\par \par \uc2 Democrats in Philadelphia are now refocusing on two galvanizing tasks: taking down Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  and, more urgently, pumping up Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 . The former first lady, senator and secretary of state bears the blessing and burden of having been in public life for more than a quarter century: Everyone knows her, but more than half don't like her, polls show.\par \par \uc2 To change that, the convention will include a four-day telling of her story -- through her husband, former President \uc2 Bill \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , people who have known her, and a series of films.\par \par \uc2 "Not long ago, \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  was one of the best liked and most admired public officials in this country," said Mark Mellman, a Democratic consultant. "She needs to use the convention in part as a vehicle to remind people why they thought so highly of her."\par \par \uc2 Each night will also feature Americans describing how Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's work either helped them, or how her policies would make their lives better.\par \par \uc2 Speakers will include first responders from the 2001 terrorist attacks in New York, a man who grew up in foster care and then interned in Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's Senate office, and a girl whose parents are in the U.S. illegally.\par \par \uc2 The convention's opening night, Monday, is expected to feature a rallying call for Sanders supporters to unite behind Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  and against Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 . The Vermont senator and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D., Mass.), a progressive leader, will both speak, as will first lady \uc2 Michelle Obama\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  confronts a challenge similar to that faced by Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  at his party's convention, where he deployed family members in an effort to present a more personal view to improve his negative image.\par \par \uc2 After months of campaigning, polls show Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  and Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  have become, respectively, the least-liked and second-least-liked people to become major-party nominees in modern times.\par \par \uc2 "This will be her last chance before the [fall] debates to speak to the country in an unfiltered way," said Geoff Garin, who conducts polls for the pro-\uc2 Clinton\uc2  super PAC Priorities USA. "She needs to get her negatives down, and the convention needs to make the positive case for her."\par \par \uc2 ---\par \par \uc2 Carol E.

\par\par \b \uc2 U.S. News --- THE OUTLOOK: Debate Over Borrowing Sees Change in Tone\b0\par\par\uc2 By Nick Timiraos   \par \uc2 806 \uc2 words\par \uc2 25 July 2016\par \uc2 The Wall Street Journal\par \uc2 J\par A2\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 No matter who wins the White House in November, don't expect to hear new calls for reduced spending.\par \par \uc2 Gone are the fights of yesteryear over striking a "grand bargain" to slash the debt. In their place a new debate has emerged over whether America's borrowing capacity has gone up -- and how the nation might take advantage of it.\par \par \uc2 The top candidates from both major parties have made scant mention of addressing rising long-term deficits and are calling instead for an increase in federal stimulus.\par \par \uc2 Republican nominee \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  has outlined massive tax cuts and, without getting specific, has promised big federal outlays on infrastructure, border security and an expansion of health-care services for veterans.\par \par \uc2 The GOP platform calls for a constitutional amendment requiring balanced budgets, but that's easier said than done, as illustrated by congressional Republicans' inability to pass a budget resolution this year.\par \par \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , the likely Democratic nominee, also has issued proposals for spending on roads and higher education, projects she would fund with new taxes on higher-income earners and the financial industry.\par \par \uc2 Four years ago, the Democratic Party platform referred seven times to cutting the deficit. The platform that delegates will consider at this week's convention in Philadelphia doesn't mention the deficit and pledges to pay for new spending.\par \par \uc2 The shift on both sides of the aisle is remarkable because it coincides with what economists consider full employment.\par \par \uc2 The 2012 \uc2 election\uc2  turned largely on how Washington would end a series of rolling budget crises. Huge deficits after the 2007-09 recession sparked fears of runaway inflation that would bring higher borrowing costs, choking growth.\par \par \uc2 President \uc2 Barack Obama\uc2 's re-\uc2 election\uc2  didn't fully resolve the fight by producing one big budget accord. Instead, it led to a series of smaller deals that raised taxes on the wealthy and gradually loosened automatic, across-the-board spending curbs known as the "sequester." There was drama along the way. In October 2013, the government shut down for 16 days.\par \par \uc2 Now, years of curbs on military and domestic programs have pushed the pendulum in the direction of more, not less, spending. Congress and the White House agreed last fall not only to a budget deal that boosted spending but also to extending a series of tax breaks without providing for offsetting revenue increases or spending cuts.\par \par \uc2 So what accounts for the shifting political dynamic?\par \par \uc2 First, an expanding economy and the budget agreements of recent years have returned near-term deficits to their long-run averages. Second, health-care cost growth, a major driver of projected deficits, has slowed. Third, markets indicate borrowing costs may be lower for longer than anyone expected just a few years ago amid weaker global growth prospects.\par \par \uc2 The national debt as a share of gross domestic product has more than doubled since 2007, to around 75%, but net interest payments on the debt have actually declined. They fell to 1.25% of GDP last year, the lowest level since 1968.\par \par \uc2 Long-term deficits haven't gone away, of course. The \uc2 Congressional Budget Office\uc2  this month said the national debt was on track to exceed the total output of the economy by 2033, six years earlier than last year's forecast. The change was largely due to last year's policy changes.\par \par \uc2 Also, a rising share of federal spending will be on autopilot as more retirees become eligible for Medicare and Social Security, whose spending isn't appropriated annually by Congress. The current low-rate environment "offers a false sense of security," said Michael Peterson, president of the Peter G. Peterson Foundation, a group that pushed for deficit reduction.\par \par \uc2 Still, the shifting political consensus echoes a similar rethink among some economists who say that stronger demand from abroad for U.S. Treasurys could keep interest rates lower for longer.\par \par \uc2 That would boost the case for tolerating higher debt levels, said economists Doug Elmendorf, who headed the CBO from 2009 until 2015, and Louise Sheiner of the \uc2 Brookings Institution\uc2 , in a paper in February. They argued that any boost in spending should go toward policies that raise slumping labor productivity to lift economic growth.\par \par \uc2 When interest rates fall below economic growth rates, governments can borrow while still holding down the debt-to-GDP ratio. Low rates may present the U.S. with such an opportunity.\par \par \uc2 "Extraordinarily low interest rates makes the economics of public investment profoundly different than it appeared a decade ago," said \uc2 Larry Summers\uc2 , an economist at Harvard University and former U.S. Treasury secretary.\par \par \uc2 None of this means the U.S. will escape long-run, demographic-driven spending challenges. But it could buy the next president a little more breathing room.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=wjco20160725000052"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document J000000020160725ec7p00013\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw272\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4080\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 I think it's a mistake to view Texas Sen. Ted Cruz as a loose cannon, operating on his own, who threatens party unity ("GOP Split as Cruz Snubs \uc2 Trump\uc2 ," page one, July 21). Instead, Sen. Cruz's nonendorsement of presidential nominee \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  represents the view of much of the Republican establishment, political and financial, who want to maintain party unity on issues like free trade and remind candidate \uc2 Trump\uc2  that, if he wants their support in the general \uc2 election\uc2 , he better get back on the reservation on such key issues.\par \par \uc2 John E. Stafford\par \par \uc2 Rye, N.Y.\par \par \uc2 ---\par \par \uc2 Ted Cruz signed a pledge to support the candidate for president selected in the Republican primary. It is hard to imagine that George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, John Adams or James Madison would sign a pledge and then break their word. Unfortunately, we live in a world where simple honesty is easily disregarded in favor of political expediency. Men who claim the high road on behalf of conservatives should be men of honor. We have too many politicians who promise the people one thing and then go to Washington and do the opposite.\par \par \uc2 Ron Cope\par \par \uc2 Chicago\par \par \uc2 ---\par \par \uc2 The American voters are witness to a continued fractured GOP, loaded with personality disorders. As much as the Democratic administration has been ruining the nation for the past eight years, it will be extremely difficult to beat Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  with such a chaotic, undisciplined and disconnected GOP.\par \par \uc2 Peter Stern\par \par \uc2 Driftwood, Texas\par \par \uc2 ---\par \par \uc2 Ted Cruz is a man who lectures us about ethics, values and integrity and then shows us that those rules don't apply to him.\par \par \uc2 Alan Yendle\par \par \uc2 Austin, Texas\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=wjco20160725000025"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document J000000020160725ec7p0000c\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw272\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4080\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 REVIEW & OUTLOOK (Editorial)\par \b \uc2 Clinton\uc2  Raises Kaine\b0\par\par\uc2 585 \uc2 words\par \uc2 25 July 2016\par \uc2 The Wall Street Journal\par \uc2 J\par A10\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  must not have been impressed by the Republican convention. In choosing Tim Kaine as her running mate late Friday, the Democrat is showing that she is so confident of winning in November that she can risk choosing a capable if conventional Senator who can help her govern perhaps more than he can help her win.\par \par \uc2 If she feared that \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  might pull away millions of Bernie Sanders voters, she might have gone for an economic populist like Senators Sherrod Brown (Ohio) or Elizabeth Warren (Massachusetts). If she worried about minority turnout, she might have gone with New Jersey Senator \uc2 Cory Booker\uc2  or a Hispanic. Instead Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  chose a 58-year-old white male, in a party that prizes identity politics above all, and a career politician in an antiestablishment year. She must believe Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  will be enough to scare her party into line behind her in the fall.\par \par \uc2 As a Senator and former Governor of Virginia, Mr. Kaine will help Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  nail down a swing state that both George W. Bush and President Obama won twice. As an establishment Democrat not from the Sanders wing of the party, the Senator may also reassure some college-educated Republicans who don't like Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  but can't abide Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 . Perhaps they'll vote for her rather than stay home or go libertarian.\par \par \uc2 Make no mistake, Mr. Kaine is a progressive on most policy issues. He is a Catholic who is personally opposed to abortion but supports abortion rights. He is also a feminist favorite who supports universal pre-K and government intervention to require equal pay for women. He has a 100% rating on \uc2 Planned Parenthood\uc2 's 2016 voting scorecard.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Kaine's economic record also tilts left and he has no problem raising taxes. In 2013 he introduced a bill to allow oil drilling off the Atlantic coast. But he voted against the Keystone XL pipeline in 2015, one of only 34 Democrats who did so, and even though his fellow Virginia Democrat Mark Warner voted yes.\par \par \uc2 More encouraging is his vote in 2015 for trade promotion authority. He spoke approvingly last week about the Pacific trade agreement, which Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  and Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  oppose. "I am having discussions with a lot of groups around Virginia about the treaty itself. I see much in it to like," he said at a Virginia event Thursday. But on Saturday, after his VP selection, his spokeswoman told the press that he had changed his mind and decided to oppose it. Funny how that happens.\par \par \uc2 This flip-flop aside, Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  may have chosen Mr. Kaine to help her in 2017 if Republicans control Congress. As Governor he had to work with a GOP legislature. His main priority was transportation and public-works spending, which is likely to be a \uc2 Clinton\uc2  priority. If Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  wins with a Republican House, she will have to decide how much to compromise to get things done. Mr. Kaine has a winning personality and works comfortably across the political aisle.\par \par \uc2 Four more years of Mr. Obama's habit of executive rule and demonizing opponents would further polarize the country and leave her without much of a legacy. A President \uc2 Clinton\uc2  would need faster economic growth to have any chance of fulfilling her policy or political ambitions. Mr. Kaine is a shrewd governing choice -- if Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  is right about the \uc2 election\uc2 .\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=wjco20160725000023"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document J000000020160725ec7p0000a\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw272\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4080\pichgoal600

\par\par \b \uc2 When a Ringmaster Leapt into the Political Circus\b0\par\par\uc2 By Thomas V. DiBacco   \par \uc2 809 \uc2 words\par \uc2 25 July 2016\par \uc2 The Wall Street Journal\par \uc2 J\par A11\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 He was equal parts businessman and showman, a world-famous entertainer who sold success itself -- and then leapt into the political fray. No, it isn't Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2 . It's Phineas Taylor Barnum, born this month in 1810.\par \par \uc2 P.T. Barnum earned a place in history as the founder of his namesake circus and proprietor of the American Museum, where his outlandish exhibits -- bearded women, giants, conjoined twins -- sold some 82 million tickets. Fewer remember Barnum the mayor, state legislator and failed candidate for Congress.\par \par \uc2 Born in Bethel, Conn., Barnum found fame after moving to New York City in 1834. His first exhibit was a woman alleged to be the 160-year-old nurse to infant George Washington. "I am a showman by profession," he once wrote. Barnum toured with his concocted exhibits and then went into debt to buy his New York museum, which opened in 1842. The public loved the spectacle it offered, and when newspapers criticized his fare, Barnum had an answer: "Without promotion, something terrible happens. Nothing." By the 1850s, two decades before he opened his circus with James A. Bailey, Barnum was one of the wealthiest and best-known men in the world. President Garfield called him the "Kris Kringle of America."\par \par \uc2 Barnum dabbled in real estate, but filed for bankruptcy in 1855 after failing to build a successful industrial park out of farmland in Connecticut. Then he leveraged fame to make a new fortune. For the next five years he toured America and Europe giving lectures on "The Art of Money-Getting, Or Success in Life." His autobiography, first written in 1855 and rewritten and republished time and again, sold more than a million copies before his death in 1891. The book promised to teach Barnum's "Rules for Business and Making a Fortune."\par \par \uc2 Barnum was immersed in the politics of his day. "It always seemed to me," he stated, "that a man who 'takes no interest in politics' is unfit to live in a land where the government rests in the hands of the people." Originally a Jacksonian Democrat, he was offered the party's nomination for Connecticut governor in 1853. But he declined, upset with the party's drift from reform programs.\par \par \uc2 Watching the violence over slavery in Bleeding Kansas turned Barnum into a Republican. During the 1860 presidential campaign, he was a member of the "Wide Awakes," a paramilitary group dedicated to Lincoln's \uc2 election\uc2 . Members replicated torchlight parades in their homes by lighting candles in the windows. When one of his Democratic neighbors kept his home dark, Barnum found a way, in the owner's absence, to illuminate it anyway.\par \par \uc2 In 1865 he ran for the Connecticut legislature, mixing business and politics in an exuberant showman style. He ultimately served four years and focused on advancing the voting rights of freed slaves and women, abolishing the death penalty and restricting birth control. When the 13th Amendment, which abolished slavery, came up in the legislature, Barnum urged ratification: "A human soul," he said, "is not to be trifled with. It may tenant the body of a Chinaman, a Turk, an Arab or a Hottentot -- it is still an immortal spirit."\par \par \uc2 In 1867 he ran for Congress, but his campaign was mostly defensive. For instance, Barnum had to fend off charges of cruelty to animals (he fed his museum's boa constrictor live rabbits). Barnum's opponent was his third cousin, Democrat William H. Barnum, a political boss of Fairfield County. The district had become a solid Democratic stronghold after the war, and P.T.'s only hope was to challenge his cousin to debate. But W.H. refused and won the seat. No matter. In 1888 P.T.'s name was tossed around as the Prohibition Party's presidential candidate.\par \par \uc2 In 1875 he ran, successfully, for mayor of Bridgeport on a reform platform. During his one-year term, he enforced laws against prostitution, reformed jails by giving prisoners work duties, and promoted gas street lighting. Today the city's Barnum Avenue and Barnum Museum attest to his legacy. No doubt a hustler, Barnum believed that the keys to success were simple: "Politeness and civility," he stressed, "are the best capital ever invested in business."\par \par \uc2 Readers are left to draw their own conclusions, but asked about the 19th century's consummate showman on "Meet the Press" in January, D.J. \uc2 Trump\uc2  embraced the comparison. "We need P.T. Barnum, a little bit," he said, "because we have to build up the image of our country." Somehow one suspects "politeness and civility" isn't what Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  meant.\par \par \uc2 ---\par \par \uc2 Mr. DiBacco, co-author of a high-school textbook on U.S. history, is professor emeritus at \uc2 American University in Washington, D.C\uc2 .\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=wjco20160725000020"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document J000000020160725ec7p00007\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw272\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4080\pichgoal600

\par\par \b \uc2 Information Age\uc2 : \uc2 Trump\uc2 's Big Data Gamble\b0\par\par\uc2 By L. Gordon Crovitz   \par \uc2 798 \uc2 words\par \uc2 25 July 2016\par \uc2 The Wall Street Journal\par \uc2 J\par A9\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 Among \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2 's unorthodoxies is his campaign's refusal to use big data. "I've always felt it was overrated," Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  said in May. "Obama got the votes much more so than his data-processing machine. And I think the same is true with me."\par \par \uc2 David Plouffe\uc2 , who ran \uc2 Barack Obama\uc2 's campaign in 2008, tweeted: "\uc2 Trump\uc2  now wants to ban data and modeling from his campaign. Agree with him that Obama got the votes not data. But flying blind is nuts." Democratic operative Ron Klain quipped in response: "Plouffe: Ix-nay on the elping-hay of rump-tray."\par \par \uc2 They have reason to laugh. Campaign professionals in both parties agree the Democrats have a large lead in information about voters -- and that smart use of data can make the difference, at least in close elections. When she officially becomes the party's nominee this week, \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  will inherit the database Mr. Obama's team built over two campaigns.\par \par \uc2 In 2008 the Obama campaign gathered so much information that it was "confident it knew the name of every one of the 69,456,897 Americans" who voted for him, according to journalist Sasha Issenberg. The 2012 campaign built a fully merged database Republicans have yet to match.\par \par \uc2 "We are going to measure every single thing in this campaign," Obama campaign manager Jim Messina said in 2011. His team built a database connecting personal data from traditional sources, such as reports from field workers and pollsters, with voters' social-media posts and other online behavior, plus commercial consumer data of the sort that online retailers and credit agencies use.\par \par \uc2 That allowed precise targeting of the most "persuadable" voters. "We knew who these people were going to vote for before they decided," an Obama data scientist told Mr. Issenberg. Voters were hit with tailored messages. In one case, the campaign sent seven different customized email invitations to one fundraising dinner in New York.\par \par \uc2 Mitt Romney\uc2 's smaller data team started out behind and never caught up. After the Democrats' 2012 victory, they created the Project Legacy database, which Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  inherits this week. Now Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , behind in data by two \uc2 election\uc2  cycles, doesn't think he needs to worry about the data he lacks -- a known unknown for his campaign.\par \par \uc2 As a celebrity-politician, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  uses social media brilliantly. By one estimate the free publicity he has drawn is the equivalent of $2 billion in advertising. But that's very different from how analytical marketers target and persuade prospects, whether for orange juice or presidential candidates.\par \par \uc2 It may be pandering, but the Obama campaigns proved it works. Democrats are updating the existing database with voter profiles based on how they voted in local elections, which magazines they read, their bank balances and the health topics they search online. Republicans using the #NeverTrump hashtag should expect to be targeted by the \uc2 Clinton\uc2  campaign with custom messages on the virtues of voting Libertarian or staying home. Other messages will highlight Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's negatives while minimizing Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's.\par \par \uc2 Reports say her hundreds of data scientists are working especially closely with \uc2 Facebook\uc2  to leverage each voter's social network. The campaign is testing which messages resonate best with each prospective voter. It will also use \uc2 Facebook\uc2  to remind Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's supporters to urge like-minded friends and relatives to go to the polls.\par \par \uc2 A \uc2 Pew Research Center\uc2  study last week uncovered a new way the \uc2 Clinton\uc2  campaign is using \uc2 Facebook\uc2  to gather more information about voters. It found that 80% of the links on the campaign's \uc2 Facebook\uc2  account link to pages on the campaign's website, where more user data can be captured. In contrast, 78% of the links on the \uc2 Trump\uc2  Facebook account take users to news articles on media sites, where his campaign has no ability to track users or mine their data.\par \par \uc2 Campaign strategists say big data is especially valuable in close presidential races, in which some votes matter more than others. In 2012 Mr. Obama's data scientists ran more than 60,000 \uc2 election\uc2  simulations every night to figure out in which states to allocate resources, and which counties in those states were the most promising sources of votes.\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 Trump\uc2  campaign might hope this is the year voters resent how their information is used to market to them. But consumers seem to have gotten used to being targeted by commercial marketers, so Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  probably can't count on outrage over Democrats' making smarter use of data.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  may not like it, but data from past presidential elections finds an undeniable correlation: The candidate with the best data is the winner.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=wjco20160725000014"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document J000000020160725ec7p00001\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 CORRECTION APPENDEDIn June of 2015, Felicia Joy Wong was in her car, awaiting with some apprehension the economic address that would officially open \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's presidential campaign. The speech was being staged at the F.D.R. memorial on New York City's Roosevelt Island, and though Wong is a political operative of atypical modesty -- she describes herself as a former schoolteacher whose accession to minor power has been entirely accidental -- she had taken the choice of venue as auspicious. Wong runs the Roosevelt Institute, a small think tank (for lack of a better term) that originated in trusts established to promote the legacies of Franklin and Eleanor. Its chief economist, the Nobel laureate Joseph Stiglitz, indirectly coined the Occupy movement's enduring slogan (''We are the 99 percent''), and Stiglitz and Wong each saw the \uc2 election\uc2  as an opportunity to channel Occupy energy into national politics. The country was perhaps ready once again, they believed, for what F.D.R.\par \par \uc2  called ''bold, persistent experimentation'' in our economic affairs. Two of Wong's senior staff members had gone to the island for the event, but she herself bowed out, claiming the duties of a part-time suburban soccer coach and mom.\par \par \uc2 In the car, Wong heard the candidate say: ''The middle class needs more growth and more fairness. Growth and fairness go together. For lasting prosperity, you can't have one without the other.''\par \par \uc2 Oh, my God, Wong thought, I can't believe she just said that. Each time she repeated this story to me, she narrowed her eyes toward an imaginary car radio and pointed in disbelief.\par \par \uc2 ''Prosperity can't be just for C.E.O.s and hedge-fund managers,'' the candidate continued. ''Democracy can't just be for the billionaires and corporations.''\par \par \uc2 Oh, my God, Wong thought again, I can't believe she just said that. It may have been political boilerplate, but Wong thrilled to it. Her incredulity had yielded to pleasure and admiration. Republicans, the candidate went on, ''pledge to wipe out tough rules on Wall Street, rather than rein in the banks that are still too risky, courting future failures.''\par \par \uc2 Wong stopped the car to check her phone. Exultant emails were streaming in. ''This is our plan!'' one Roosevelt board member wrote. ''This is your plan!''\par \par \uc2 ''Our plan'' was ''Rewriting the Rules of the American Economy,'' an inventive combination of narrative history and policy platform that Roosevelt published the month before. The report billed itself as a comprehensive agenda to ameliorate inequality. First, it said, inequality is a choice, not an inevitable byproduct of technology, globalization and the uneven distribution of personal virtue. Second, it held that the longstanding notion of an economic trade-off between growth and equality is a fiction.\par \par \uc2 Unlike the myriad other white papers that each week were drafted, edited, somnolently received at other think tanks and shelved without fanfare, this report -- original not so much in its ideas as in its clarity and vigor -- had captured wide and consequential attention. In the months leading up to its publication, the Roosevelt team was in close touch with \uc2 Clinton\uc2  speechwriters and advisers, and in subsequent rallies the candidate continued to draw upon the report, even at the level of explicit language; calls to ''rewrite the rules'' found their way into more of her addresses. The many news reports that linked the speech to Wong's organization consistently and erroneously relocated her team to Washington. (Their headquarters are in Midtown Manhattan, in an Art Deco tower in the shadow of the Citigroup Center.)\par \par \uc2 Much of the left, including the significant bloc that rejected \uc2 Clinton\uc2  in the primaries in favor of Bernie Sanders and his call for ''revolution,'' finds Wong and her allies delusional in their hope that ''Rewriting the Rules'' might be realized in Democratic Party practice. But the Sanders and \uc2 Trump\uc2  insurrections revealed an appetite for economic populism that no one in either party establishment had quite anticipated. Now Roosevelt and other progressive groups are wagering that a mandate for economic overhaul might already exist, and that it might even be carried out by the woman who always was the party's near-certain nominee. Wong herself believes that the financial crisis radically destabilized the politics of the American economy, possibly for decades to come, and that 2016 might well mark the early commotion of a genuine political realignment.\par \par \uc2 As the party heads into its convention in Philadelphia, this coalition sees encouraging signals -- perhaps most notably the role that Elizabeth Warren, a key Roosevelt ally, has come to play in the campaign -- that \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's economic sympathies might ultimately lie further to the left than skeptics supposed. Roosevelt is a 501(c)(3), and though it does maintain a political-action arm, it does not work to elect specific candidates. Still, various representatives from \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's speechwriting and policy teams regularly solicit the organization's input. Roosevelt in turn has redoubled its efforts not only on advancing the ideas in ''Rewriting the Rules'' but also in recruiting the personnel necessary to carry them out, in the form of a methodical effort to find suitable candidates for economic positions in a future presidential administration.\par \par \uc2 Rob Stein, the liberal operative whose establishment of the Democracy Alliance in 2005 did perhaps more than any other act to funnel new money and new ardor into progressive causes, told me: ''Like no other progressive institution, Roosevelt is bringing strategically relevant insight to the deeper structural problems of our economy.'' Part of the reason Wong and her team remain mostly unheralded is that they eschew power politics for the quieter work of developing networks to act on ideas. They thus do not see themselves as pushing or pulling or dragging the Democratic nominee to their position. They believe that this candidate, of all candidates, is unlikely to respond to public hectoring or ultimatums. The greatest incentive they can offer is a demonstration that \uc2 Clinton\uc2  may well already be the candidate that progressives -- and the electorate -- have been waiting for.\par \par \uc2 A displaced Californian, Wong lives with her family in Westchester but makes routine \uc2 Amtrak\uc2  face-work pilgrimages to Washington. She has thick, artfully unruly cataracts of black hair and moves with a long, darting, buoyant stride. In meetings, she spends much of her time profusely, sweetly and genuinely thanking people for their thoughtful recommendations of white papers she has already read, studies she has already digested, arguments she could recite by heart, academics she already funds or would like to, funders who already donate and, often, information or ideas she herself has originated. Men of bulk in loosened ties have a way of talking at her for hours and then lifting her best notions, as if accidentally choosing a nicer umbrella on the way out of a restaurant.\par \par \uc2 One cold, dreary spring day I accompanied her to the A.F.L.-C.I.O. building on 16th Street NW, a foreboding grid of polished beige stone with a lobby dominated by a hallucinogenic two-story marble mosaic. Wong often proceeds by indirection, and the obvious contrast of this first meeting -- between Big Labor's encumbrances and Roosevelt's dexterity -- made, in retrospect, a deliberate point.\par \par \uc2 Damon Silvers, the organization's policy director, greeted us in a cluttered low-floor office that looked as if it might belong to a law professor. He showed us seats at a wobbly round table and talked about wages and productivity and economic pain. ''There have been a few years over the last 30 with broad-based wage growth,'' he noted, ''but those are the outliers, the exceptions -- a few years under Reagan, some under \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , but stagnation has been the regime since 1980.'' He praised Roosevelt as the source of ''heavyweight economic thinking'' on this, and for ''upping the ante.''\par \par \uc2 Wong deflected the credit. ''Well, you've been saying this,'' she replied, ''and Elizabeth Warren says it, and Stiglitz has been saying it for 30 years, but now it's almost common knowledge.'' Wong was more concerned about how they planned to put that common knowledge into action before the looming convention.\par \par \uc2 ''Despite President Obama's efforts, the rules of the economy continue to drive runaway inequality,'' Silvers went on. ''The power dynamics that were in place in 2008 are still in place now, and we don't have all the time in the world to fix this.''\par \par \uc2 This continued for a while, as Silvers relaxed into the comfortable contours of his analysis and Wong steered the visit toward what might actually be done. Eventually she was summoned to see the union's president, \uc2 Richard Trumka\uc2 , whose seigneurial berth looks down on the White House. Silvers directed me in the meantime to a vitrine of the fat blue bill-signing pens L.B.J. used to enact the Great Society -- food stamps, public broadcasting, urban mass transport, water quality, wholesome poultry products. ''If you want to see what structural change looks like,'' he told me, tapping on the glass, ''take a look at this.''\par \par \uc2 The progressive organizations in Wong's rotation take as a matter of course the idea that the Obama administration was a significant missed opportunity for transformation on that order. They do not entirely blame Obama. He had his legislative victories -- most importantly in the Affordable Care Act -- but one lesson they drew from his time in office was that liberals had long been overly fixated on legislative success. (Johnson had a Congress he could work with; Obama mostly did not, and the next president probably won't, either.) The right has set the agenda for the past 35 years because they built their economic movement deductively (from the first principle of the unregulated market) and took their victories where they could find them. The left, by comparison, tended to moralize, and spoke in the language of justice instead of growth. When they did talk about economics, it took the form of individual issues -- minimum wage, student debt, paid family and sick leave -- rather than overarching pronouncements. This muddle worsened during the Bush era, when urgent noneconomic concerns forced the left to privilege short-term electoral tactics over long-term strategy.\par \par \uc2 Roosevelt was designed to be a place, independent of the party establishment, to unite all of these factions under the banner of long-term, coherent economic thinking. Had such a movement existed in 2008, it might have seized on the financial crisis as an opportunity for structural economic reform. Obama's recovery model, to the group's lasting dismay, remained in thrall to old superstitions about growth. The goal of the bailout was to fix the existing financial system and get credit flowing back into the economy while keeping an eye on deficit spending. But today, though high-level macroeconomic numbers like monthly job growth or the headline unemployment rate have improved, almost half of the new jobs created in the first five years of the recovery were poverty-level. Repaired with a kludge, the system went right back to doing exactly what it did before: allowing the extraordinary concentration of power in the hands of the few to dominate the prospects of the many.\par \par \uc2 Roosevelt and its allies believe that the crisis could have been an occasion -- unseen since the New Deal -- for the diffusion of authority, large-scale infrastructural investment, attention to low-wage growth and relief for the plight of overextended homeowners rather than banks. But that opportunity passed by because, in the absence of a strong, organized countervailing force, responsibility for the bailout simply defaulted to the claque of \uc2 Citigroup\uc2  veterans and sympathizers that had administered Democratic economic policy for what was now a full generation. The critics didn't think that these ex-bankers were unscrupulous, but rather that they acted in accordance with the free-market orthodoxy they inherited from their predecessors.\par \par \uc2 With all this resentment of bankers, a news consumer might have thought the enthusiasm in this milieu -- that is, all the groups that resisted the legacy of deregulated, race-neutral, free-market bipartisanship -- would accrue to Bernie Sanders. But Sanders in fact came up only rarely in my conversations with them, usually in praise of the sincerity of his message. The common view of the Democratic contest was that Sanders did a great service in pushing \uc2 Clinton\uc2  to the left. Though in some senses this was clearly the case -- on the minimum wage and on college tuition -- there was an alternate interpretation. As Sanders gained traction, it seemed to Wong and her partners that \uc2 Clinton\uc2  had simply ceded to him the territory of aggressive financial reform. Sanders, in their view, hadn't so much pulled her to the left as pushed her to swivel.\par \par \uc2 The Roosevelt coalition agreed by and large with the direction of Sanders's economic program, but they regretted the crudeness of his exposition. They understood, for example, the appeal of a call to break up the banks but found greater sophistication in \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's proposals to regulate ''shadow banking.'' They wished his advisers had been more careful with the numbers. And the personal iconoclasm and moral purity of the Sanders campaign didn't lend themselves to governance. How, given the way Obama's ideals foundered on a kind of Washington default mode, did Sanders plan to staff an entire administration?\par \par \uc2 Wong and her allies spent a lot more time worrying about \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  than they did valorizing Sanders. Their fear was, and is, that \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's response to \uc2 Trump\uc2 's faux populism, racism, xenophobia and misogyny -- that we needed to make America not ''great'' but ''whole'' again -- would crowd out everything she once said about corporations and inequality. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's central economic metaphor, ''ladders of opportunity,'' promised access to the current system rather than a wholly different one. But Roosevelt has found that a message of ''leveling the playing field'' polls much better with voters of color and the white working class. (Its recent follow-up to ''Rewriting the Rules,'' a paper about race by the fellows Dorian Warren and Andrea Flynn, acknowledges that the economic interests and political needs of the two constituencies may not always seem perfectly aligned.) The central preoccupation for Wong, and for Silvers and for Warren, was to demonstrate that it was the courageous thing, not the cautious one, that would capture the preponderance of the electorate.\par \par \uc2 It is common, in Washington, to view yourself as there by some celestial accident; Beltway insiders delight in a good sneering reference to Beltway insiders. But Wong really does seem like an improbable person to preside over a think tank. She grew up in Silicon Valley, studied poetry at Stanford, got a Ph.D. in political science at Berkeley, worked as a high-school teacher and then at a valley start-up and then happened into a job at the Democracy Alliance, a semi-secretive club of progressive donors. She can barely bring herself to utter the phrase ''think tank,'' much less ''policy shop.'' Late one evening in Washington, we walked by a thickset monolith that glowed with a cold marmoreal light, as if James Turrell had built a fortress for some paranoid ice king. The front read CSIS: the \uc2 Center for Strategic and International Studies\uc2 . Wong rolled her eyes, theatrically shuddered and tucked her runaway hair behind her ear. ''Now that's a think tank.''\par \par \uc2 On the left, there are lots of small organizations in Washington that publish granular research on specific economic trends. But the most significant liberal think tank in recent years has been the \uc2 Center for American Progress\uc2 , founded in 2003 by the former \uc2 Bill \uc2 Clinton\uc2  chief of staff (and current \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  campaign chair) \uc2 John Podesta\uc2  as his party's answer to the conservative \uc2 Heritage Foundation\uc2 . CAP has done a lot of innovative policy work, especially on universal preschool and health care, but it was always less of a research organization than a shadow government for an opposition in exile. When Obama was elected, roughly a third of CAP's staff went into his administration. CAP was founded in an era when few liberals were of the opinion that the system itself was broken: If you just found slightly better Democrats, elected them to office and put smarter policies in their hands, they believed, the country would return to the prosperity of the 1990s. Liberal Washington was not equipped, when the financial crisis broke, to tender a holistic analysis of what was ailing the economy. (Today, CAP's economic ideas are more in line with those of Roosevelt, and in 2015 it released a report on short-termism that anticipated part of ''Rewriting the Rules.'')\par \par \uc2 In 2009, a political scientist named Andrew Rich, known for writing about the ''war of ideas,'' was drafted to reinvent the Roosevelt Institute as a place for the radical thinking that postcrisis politics seemed to require. Roosevelt at the time was an ad hoc collection of spare progressive parts, including the upkeep of the F.D.R. Library in Hyde Park, N.Y. Rich believed that if you weren't in Washington, and you weren't beholden to the party apparatus, and if you got the right people -- people who were too idiosyncratic or rough-hewn for academia, or academics who wanted to be politically relevant but needed help with finding an audience for their work -- you could create a new kind of institution on a looser, livelier model.\par \par \uc2 At that moment of upheaval and administration dithering, financial reform was the new Roosevelt's obvious first priority. Rich brought on Stiglitz and Mike Konczal, whose pseudonymous financial-crisis blog had a cult following among progressives. In 2010, the organization held a conference that prominently featured Elizabeth Warren, then early in her career as a public figure. While Warren worked on the TARP oversight panel, she needed somewhere to park her aide-de-camp, Dan Geldon, to help draft the details of the \uc2 Consumer Financial Protection Bureau\uc2  that was being set up on the basis of her ideas. He served as a fellow, and he and Warren maintain close ties to Roosevelt. Warren insisted I come into her office, though she was late to a vote, so she could tell me how enormously enthusiastic she was about Roosevelt's work: ''It's a new voice in American political discourse. Their message is, We can do better than this! They're bringing fundamental optimism back to the center of American life.''\par \par \uc2 When Wong took over in 2012, she continued to recruit staff members and fellows who were at once nonaligned and well connected: to the A.F.T. and S.E.I.U., Demos, MoveOn, the Clintons. By January 2015, Wong had decided, along with her communications director, Marcus Mrowka, and her vice president of research and policy, Nell Abernathy, to prepare for the coming \uc2 election\uc2  by creating a full-dress economic agenda that would be there for the candidates' taking. ''Rewriting the Rules'' got funding from the \uc2 Ford Foundation\uc2 , whose decision last year to refocus around the issue of inequality was influenced by Roosevelt, and whose president, Darren Walker, effused to me about Wong as an ''incandescent leader'' for the progressive movement. While written by Stiglitz, the paper was worked out in consultation with labor officials, academics, congressional staff members and -- unusually for a think tank -- advocates from places like Color of Change, Naral and the Black Civic Engagement Fund.\par \par \uc2 The report lays out a stark narrative about the American economy as it exists today. Inequality, it maintains, is a function not of economic laws but of the preferences awarded to the powerful to extract rents -- to exploit people who have little choice -- especially on necessary goods like housing and health care. This may have been old wine, but it was poured into new bottles; economists after Keynes lost the habit of talking about power, and Roosevelt stressed that this vision was about the way that power and prejudice created not only distorted markets but also nonfunctional ones. The economy has stalled because too much wealth is being generated in nonproductive activity, hoarded to preserve for the rich all the things government no longer provides. The long-run situation, as Wong put it to me once, is America as ''a fear-catalyzed gated community for a privileged few, and a violent, racially hostile, 'Lord of the Flies' race to the bottom for the rest of us.''\par \par \uc2 ''Rewriting the Rules'' then moves on to 37 policy recommendations. Some seek to reduce concentrated power via changes to the tax code, financial reform and labor-market interventions: enacting financial-transaction taxes; taxing corporations on global income; strengthening the right to collective bargaining; and rewriting laws -- on intellectual-property rights, lending practices, health care -- that present unfair opportunities for monopoly profits. There is a parallel pocketbook agenda: a Fed policy of full employment, via low interest rates and access to credit markets, rather than one designed to control inflation; higher living wages; gender and racial equality in pay; affordable child care. Last is infrastructure: public spending for public goods, and not just roads and bridges but also broadband, high-speed rail, smart grid, green buildings -- and especially investments in schools and housing that might end racial segregation. All three categories rest in part on public options. The role of an activist government, as Roosevelt sees it, is not to monopolize any given service, on a command-economy model, but to exist as a permanently nonextortionate market player. The report calls for a postal bank, which would expand access to banking services to the underserved; a public option for mortgages; Medicare open to all; and an expansion of Social Security via voluntary public investment accounts modeled on I.R.A.s.\par \par \uc2 From a budgetary perspective, at least, the report takes care to present its recommendations as feasible and responsible, imagining that all of those public options (for example) would be run as break-even enterprises. ''Rewriting the Rules'' does call for an increase in top individual marginal tax rates to perhaps 45 percent, a substantial increase by today's Republican standards but well in line with contemporary Europe or 20th-century America. What was novel was that, unlike the usual centrist Democrat call for more job training and an expansion of the earned-income tax credit, this was not about tinkering with the old tax-and-transfer liberalism but about changing the fundamental structure of the economy. Their demands were vaulting, but they held that an agenda offering freedom from exploitation (rather than freedom from regulation), and insisting that greater fairness would benefit everyone, would resonate with all Americans.\par \par \uc2 Joseph Stiglitz is a short, oracular man with gray hair and gray stubble trimmed to equal length, which gives his head the round softness of a late-stage dandelion. His minimal-cognitive-load uniform is a blue sportcoat, an open-necked blue dress shirt and roomy gray trousers over thick-soled black sneakers; I saw him wear this unvarying attire to work in his vast personal complex at \uc2 Columbia University\uc2 , meetings at the \uc2 Ford Foundation\uc2 , a public Roosevelt colloquy with the Black Lives Matter activist Alicia Garza and Hill briefings. His clothes, along with his trundling gait, give him the appearance of a curmudgeonly but twinkle-eyed shtetl tailor, come to dispense wisdom about structures of international trade-dispute arbitration as he fits the bar mitzvah boy for a suit. He has a dry wit but seems not entirely sure when jokes have been received as such, and so, as if someone once told him that he should soften his fearsome intellect by smiling more, he punctuates his speech with a randomized distribution of grins.\par \par \uc2 Everywhere it has been pointed out that this \uc2 election\uc2  feels like a prolonged rehash of 1990s enmities. Wong has a Faulknerian view: ''It's not just the same fights,'' she told me, ''but the exact same people.'' The story goes that there were two distinct factions in the \uc2 Clinton\uc2  White House: the free-market, centrist, ''neoliberal'' wing that we now associate with such figures as \uc2 Larry Summers\uc2  and \uc2 Robert Rubin\uc2  and such institutions as the Democratic Leadership Council; and then people like Stiglitz -- who was head of the Council of Economic Advisers for two years -- and Robert Reich. The Summers/Rubin wing largely prevailed. An approach to crime and poverty was engineered to win back Reagan Democrats so they could pass a deregulatory program that would appeal to emerging managerial wealth. The party's Rubinite/\uc2 Citigroup\uc2  lineage extended through Rubin's prot\u233\'00\'E9g\u233\'00\'E9 Michael Froman, who as part of Obama's transition team helped usher \uc2 Tim Geithner\uc2  into the Treasury Department. It was this legacy that had, throughout the primaries, prevented so many people from taking the former first lady -- especially as she tied herself to Obama's tenure -- as a credible voice for the economic reforms of ''Rewriting the Rules.''\par \par \uc2 This Manichaean story is a vast oversimplification for a variety of reasons, but it did inform the way many voters, especially on the left, viewed the primaries. The fight between \uc2 Clinton\uc2  and Sanders often seemed like a choice between a repudiation of the long 1990s entirely (Robert Reich has been an outspoken Sanders supporter) or an avowal that this time the party will choose the vision of Stiglitz. The obvious mystery then becomes: Where does \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  herself stand? The problem is not that there's no answer, Wong and Stiglitz think, but that it's a badly phrased question. To pretend the battles are the same as they were in 1994 ignores the fact that the economic realities have changed, economic thinking has changed, the party has changed and -- perhaps more than anything -- the electorate has changed.\par \par \uc2 On the left, Stiglitz -- with his resignation in protest from the \uc2 World Bank\uc2 , in 2000; the 2002 publication of the bridge-burning anti-neoliberalism classic ''Globalization and Its Discontents''; and the 2011 publication, in Vanity Fair, of an article titled ''Of the 1 Percent, By the 1 Percent, For the 1 Percent'' -- is viewed, like Sanders, to have landed consistently on the right side of history. But even he believes that there's little profit in trying to evaluate the decisions of the 1990s by contemporary standards. As he put it to me, ''What the D.L.C. was about, to some extent, was the fact that the fall of the Iron Curtain had given a false euphoria to the market economy. We thought we had won. But, in reality, we hadn't won; they had failed. And we read into their collapse the wrong thing.''\par \par \uc2 Now, though, there's no excuse. ''Between 1990 and 2015 we've had the financial crisis, growth of inequality to unbounded levels, slow growth over all for a third of a century,'' Stiglitz said. ''We've had a third of a century as an experiment, and if you don't see the results of that experiment now, that's willful neglect.''\par \par \uc2 Wong was a White House fellow in the \uc2 Clinton\uc2  administration in 1998 and had her own objections to the positions of that White House, though for her at the time it had more to do with a policy of race neutrality than with neoliberalism. (She helped write an 800-page book, in the voice of the president, about racial healing; it was spiked in part because it didn't hew to the administration's official line.) For Wong, too, this \uc2 election\uc2  has proved not that the disputes of the 1990s must be fought anew but that they have already been won, decisively and across the board. They have been won on the data, now that we have another two decades of it. And they have been won on the demographics, as the millennial generation -- boisterously represented at Roosevelt by a large collegiate network and, in their office, by a young former U.C.L.A. activist named Joelle Gamble -- has never known anything but market precarity.\par \par \uc2 One way that \uc2 Clinton\uc2  could signal that she really is serious about the remediation of inequality is through the decisions made by her transition team on personnel. In July, The \uc2 Boston Globe\uc2  reported that Roosevelt had been leading a campaign to help staff the economic-policy positions in future presidential administrations. The \uc2 Clinton\uc2  campaign appeared to be lagging in this regard behind \uc2 Trump\uc2 , who had long before named \uc2 Chris Christie\uc2  transition chairman. It seemed to Wong that appointments -- especially as a proxy for the candidate's relationship with Wall Street -- were being taken as a matter of considerable seriousness, and, she told me, ''everyone is watching.''\par \par \uc2 Since the 1970s, movement conservatism has consistently outperformed progressives in laying a talent conduit. Heritage identifies young candidates and grooms them for a smooth climb through the system; adjacent to its headquarters is a library-dorm for its interns, replete with piles of free Hayek. One of Roosevelt's youngest fellows, the legal scholar K. Sabeel Rahman, likes to point out that Department of Justice regulators, drawn from conservative legal and economic circles and influenced by the ideas of Robert Bork, essentially rewrote the federal guidelines for mergers and acquisitions and thereby weakened the government's power to make antitrust cases.\par \par \uc2 Roosevelt's project, likewise, is about finding people with the economic, legal and regulatory experience to change the country's balance of power. Wong and her staff have been clear that what they are compiling is nothing so simple as a list. It is, rather, a process by which qualified candidates from all 50 states might be matched to possible jobs. This goes for top positions, like cabinet secretaries or the heads of agencies, but also down to the deputy under secretaries and staff members, whom they could introduce to the system. The people who hold these jobs now are probably lucky if their own relatives know their titles, but theirs are positions with real leverage, especially collectively: the Treasury's Domestic Finance Department's chief homeownership preservation officer; HUD's Office of Housing's deputy assistant secretary for risk management and regulatory affairs; the Department of Justice's deputy assistant attorney general for economics. It's important to look at these jobs in aggregate because centers of power in Washington are not fixed: A position, like the chief of staff of the O.M.B., that is relatively weak when filled by one candidate might, occupied by someone else, represent a key node.\par \par \uc2 The team had a few different sources for leads: securities and banking regulators at the state and local levels; the offices of the state attorneys general, especially assistants in the departments of consumer protection, education and welfare; academics in law, economics and business; and other think tanks and policy institutes. ''Where,'' they would ask a local banking regulator or assistant city manager in Seattle or San Antonio or St. Paul, ''do you think you'd want to be in five or 10 years?'' The ideal candidates have experience taking (or advocating for) regulatory action, and would thus know how to use the varied, extensive antitrust powers that individual agencies like the D.O.J. and the \uc2 Federal Trade Commission\uc2  already possess. Many of the prescriptions advanced by ''Rewriting the Rules'' would require a congressional majority to make them real; the appointments project, by contrast, would help circumvent the congressional standstill on many issues where authority already resides in the executive branch.\par \par \uc2 Wong thinks it's no longer accurate to even think of these issues in terms of left versus right. Instead, she holds, real political realignment means a long-term cultural change in the perception of government and its relationship to consolidated power. Wong has been resolute in refusing to draw a bright line, as some progressives would, to rule out bankers, in part because banks are only one element in the pattern. If most people have a hard time understanding or worrying about the concept of ''financialization,'' they have a much easier time recognizing -- as Elizabeth Warren put it in a speech at the \uc2 New America Foundation\uc2  last month -- that four airlines control 80 percent of American airline seats, three chains own 99 percent of drugstores and four companies sell 85 percent of the beef.\par \par \uc2 This appointments project is fundamentally about control, but its success lies beyond any one institution's ability -- even an institution working on behalf of and in concert with a lot of other parties -- to determine. The work could see wholesale adoption in the weeks after the convention: Allies of Elizabeth Warren, \uc2 Politico\uc2  recently reported, ensured that a commitment to personnel who were ''not beholden to the industries that they regulate'' would be enshrined in the party's platform. The project could place a few people in a scattershot way. Or, of course, it could be shelved entirely in favor of the familiar circuit of routine placement, and whoever lands the economic portfolio for the winning transition team will act, as usual, at his or her own personal discretion.\par \par \uc2 In June 2016, a little more than a year after the Roosevelt Island speech, \uc2 Clinton\uc2  gave her first major economic address as the presumed nominee, in Raleigh. She called for wage increases through stronger unions; portable benefits; an expansion of Social Security; the closing of the carried-interest loophole and an exit tax for corporate inversions; and policies to address the racial employment and racial wealth gaps. Most important for everyone at Roosevelt, she said that she planned an administration that would ''rewrite the rules so more companies share profits with their employees and fewer ship profits and jobs overseas.'' She used their phrase twice, and then used it again a few days later, at her first joint campaign appearance with Warren.\par \par \uc2 The next day, I went to see Wong in her office. She did not want to seem na\u239\'00\'EFve, but she was optimistic. ''All of my optimism now is based on all of the evidence -- on all the polling, on all the people, on what the candidate herself has said. Hillary laid down a marker on Wall Street with her Roosevelt Island speech last year. We thought at the time, She'll move away from this, and she did. But it was there for her to go back to. And I think that's been vindicated in the last 48 hours.''\par \par \uc2 Wong and I walked out into the blinding late-spring sun, and she put on her mirrored aviators. The famously infirm Citigroup Center, which had been built on feeble stilts reinforced in secret under cover of night, was reflected in them. ''My optimism wasn't dumb. It wasn't just based on the academic views on the trickle-down experiment. Yesterday's speech was a great indicator. She hit every marker. I could go through every policy in that speech and tell you which constituency it was written for.'' After running down into the subway, Wong -- who can't write a one-paragraph email without somehow mentioning eight books and 27 people -- promptly emailed me an entire roster of the \uc2 Clinton\uc2  intimates who favored real reform, including Heather Boushey of the Washington Center for Equitable Growth; Maya Harris, one of \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's senior policy advisers; and Gary Gensler, the campaign's chief financial officer.\par \par \uc2 Not all of Wong's allies take as rosy an outlook as she does. David Rolf, president of S.E.I.U. 775 told me, ''I'm not optimistic enough to think that we're out of those woods yet. The Democratic Party, its leaders and its infrastructure, is very much of two minds about economics. The progressives have gained a lot of ground, but to think that the trickle-down elements of the party are gone?'' At Roosevelt's board meeting a few weeks ago, the Center for Popular Democracy's Marbre Stahly-Butts, an architect of the Black Lives Matter policy platform, worried that the evolving platform of the Democratic convention seemed -- on matters of mass incarceration and policing in particular -- to be anemically centrist.\par \par \uc2 To Wong, though, much of the hand-wringing about \uc2 Clinton\uc2  is beside the point. People like to kibitz on the subject of who a politician ''really'' is, to claim that some votes or statements or gaffes or alliances are deeply revealing and others merely accidents, frivolities or improvisatory performances. We isolate and label a politician's essence in the hope we might predict with certainty how she'll behave in the future. But in Wong's view, the question of who a politician is -- and above all who this particular presidential candidate is -- is irrelevant. Her strategy is to proceed in public as if the candidate is certain to rise to the occasion.\par \par \uc2 A few days after the speech, Wong wrote me an email at 6 a.m. on a Sunday, her favorite time to think. ''For the 40 years that she has been in the public eye,'' she wrote, ''\uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  has been the subject of constant political analysis, armchair psychoanalysis, horrible rumor verging on slander -- and also adoration, especially from a number of women around her age who want to see her not just as a role model but a heroine.'' She continued: ''The good news for those of us arguing strenuously for the wisdom of structural economic and political reform: Whether Hillary 'really believes in the cause' or not does not matter. This surfeit of attention leaves out a bunch of other politically relevant factors beyond what is 'true' about Hillary internally.''\par \par \uc2 ''After all,'' Wong said to me more than once, ''she is unknowable. Nobody can know her. I certainly can't know her. All I can go by is what is on the public record, and who she's got around her. I'm sure I'll be disappointed again. Over the next few months, we'll all be disappointed again. But I'm only optimistic because there's evidence for me to be that way.''\par \par \uc2 Sign up for our newsletter to get the best of The \uc2 New York Times Magazine\uc2  delivered to your inbox every week.\par \par \uc2 Correction: August 7, 2016, Sunday\par \par \uc2 This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article on July 24 about the Roosevelt Institute, a think tank based in Manhattan, misidentified the union chapter of which David Rolf is president.

\par\par \uc2 Style Desk; SECTST\par \b \uc2 You Can Take Him Out of D.C. ...\b0\par\par\uc2 By DAVID HOCHMAN \par \uc2 1,469 \uc2 words\par \uc2 24 July 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 2\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 CORRECTION APPENDEDLOS ANGELES -- Stretched out on his living-room couch here, \uc2 Jon Favreau\uc2  watched Melania \uc2 Trump\uc2 's speech at the Republican National Convention on Monday night with little more than a passing interest, since he was already thinking of bed and an early flight the next morning.\par \par \uc2 At that point, as a former speechwriter for the Obama White House, he was still marveling at the parade of speakers who had passed earlier on his TV screen, including Antonio Sabato Jr. and Scott Baio, with \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2  emerging W.W.E.-style in a bright fog to the sounds of Queen's ''We Are the Champions.''\par \par \uc2 It could not get any more surreal, he remembers thinking at the time.\par \par \uc2 And then it did.\par \par \uc2 About 8:30, around a half-hour after Ms. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's speech ended, Mr. Favreau noticed on his \uc2 Twitter\uc2  feed that someone had retweeted a post from the journalist Jarrett Hill stating that there were striking similarities between the speech that had just been given and the one that \uc2 Michelle Obama\uc2  had delivered in Denver at the 2008 Democratic National Convention.\par \par \uc2 That prompted him to rewatch Mrs. Obama's speech. ''When I saw 'word is your bond' from Melania's speech, I instantly recognized the phrase from Michelle's,'' he said in an interview on Tuesday. Mr. Favreau had already tweeted his own reaction to his 121,000 followers, starting with an expletive and adding: ''They're nearly identical. Someone is seriously fired.''\par \par \uc2 Mr. Favreau certainly had reason to be interested. As the chief speechwriter for the 2008 Obama campaign, Mr. Favreau had hired the woman who wrote Mrs. Obama's address. But the incongruity did not stop there.\par \par \uc2 As he tweeted a few minutes later: ''Sarah Hurwitz, Michelle's head speechwriter, used to be Hillary's. So the \uc2 Trump\uc2  campaign plagiarized from a Hillary speechwriter.''\par \par \uc2 For Mr. Favreau (not to be confused with the actor of the same name), it was an unexpected moment back in the political fray, one he thought he had largely left behind. In March 2013, feeling burned out, he left the president's inner circle after eight years of hope, change and writing cheesy jokes for the turkey pardons.\par \par \uc2 He and some fellow D.C. exiles now run a communications consulting firm in Los Angeles, Fenway Strategies, and he has been emerging from the ghostwriter shadows with opinions of his own.\par \par \uc2 In many ways, Los Angeles is the un-Washington for Mr. Favreau. ''It's an industry town, but it's not really my industry,'' he said, although he occasionally toys with the idea of screenwriting. ''People here talk about things other than government policy, like technology, sports and, you know, 'The Bachelor.'''\par \par \uc2 Mr. Favreau, 35, still eats and breathes politics. He has a weekly podcast on The Ringer, a digital venture started last month by Bill Simmons, the sports columnist who was editor in chief of the website Grantland, which shut down last fall. Mr. Favreau pops up to talk politics on MSNBC or with Chelsea Handler on \uc2 Netflix\uc2 , looking tanned and relaxed (''Your girlfriend told me not to sleep with you,'' Ms. Handler said as they hugged goodbye).\par \par \uc2 ''Keepin' It 1600,'' the podcast Mr. Favreau hosts with Dan Pfeiffer, another former Obama adviser, is a combination wonkfest on \uc2 election\uc2  minutia and uncensored forum. Expletives fly freely, and ''insane'' is perhaps the most frequent word used to characterize Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 ''Jon can talk like an actual person rather than one of those tightly wound D.C. dudes in pleated khakis and a blue shirt,'' said Jon Lovett, who has been a guest on the show. Mr. Lovett, a writer and producer for TV shows like ''1600 Penn'' and ''The Newsroom,'' also worked as a speechwriter under President Obama.\par \par \uc2 It was 2004 when Mr. Favreau first encountered his future boss at the Democratic National Convention in Boston. Having gotten his start in Washington in Senator \uc2 John Kerry\uc2 's press office through an internship at the College of the Holy Cross, Mr. Favreau, at 22, was suddenly charged with the excruciating task of informing the senatorial candidate from Illinois that he had to remove a rousing line from his keynote address that Senator Kerry wanted to use. Mr. Obama was not pleased, but he made the change.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Favreau joined Mr. Obama's team a year later, and in 2009, he became the second-youngest chief White House speechwriter in history.\par \par \uc2 With his Ben Affleck smile and smidgen of a Mass Pike accent to match (he grew up just outside Boston, in Winchester), Mr. Favreau made the gossip pages with uncomfortable regularity.\par \par \uc2 He and the actress Rashida Jones were spotted dashing into his Dupont Circle apartment building. During the Gulf of Mexico oil spill in 2010, a photo surfaced of him, shirtless and with a buzz cut, playing a drinking game at a Georgetown bar.\par \par \uc2 More notorious was the \uc2 Facebook\uc2  shot someone posted of Mr. Favreau groping a cardboard cutout of the incoming secretary of state, \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 . Her office let him off gracefully, but Mr. Favreau learned an important policy lesson. ''Don't act like a moron,'' he said.\par \par \uc2 Over old-fashioneds at Soho House West Hollywood, the private members' club down the block from his apartment (''This is sort of my second office,'' he said), Mr. Favreau appeared fit and happy in a gray T-shirt, jeans and crisp maroon Vans.\par \par \uc2 The go-go life that had him on call 24/8 in Washington has given way to staring at his phone while in gym clothes yelling about \uc2 Trump\uc2  University. ''I decided to write for The Ringer partly because it gives me a platform, but also because people come dressed to work, and it's not just my goldendoodle I'm talking to,'' he said.\par \par \uc2 His circle in general is tighter than it once was. Mr. Favreau's brother, Andy, an actor, lives across the street. Mr. Lovett, also a neighbor, said he lives close enough ''to access Jon's Sonos system from my couch to play my entrance music.''\par \par \uc2 Over the Fourth of July weekend, Mr. Favreau became engaged to his live-in girlfriend of four years, Emily Black, who works on nonprofits for Sunshine Sachs, the public relations consultancy. ''The culture of L.A. has mellowed Jon a little, but he'll still wake me up at 6 a.m. to tell me whatever ridiculous thing \uc2 Trump\uc2  just said,'' she said.\par \par \uc2 He was on a trip to Los Angeles for a 2009 fund-raising dinner with President Obama at George Clooney's house when it struck Mr. Favreau that there was more to life than drafting floor statements on Patriot Act reauthorization. As Mr. Favreau put it, ''It was hard to have a real relationship, I didn't sleep a lot, and there was the Christmas I told my parents, 'Let's hurry up and open presents because I have an inaugural address to write.'''\par \par \uc2 Cody Keenan, the director of speechwriting since Mr. Favreau's departure, said, ''This job is great but exhausting, and I completely understand why he needed to step away.'' Mr. Keenan said he still texts with Mr. Favreau nearly every day and consults with him on speeches and the perspective that comes with living outside the Beltway.\par \par \uc2 Even without a political post (Mr. Favreau said he had no plans to return to Washington), he believes he plays an important role in supporting the Democrats this campaign season. Although he came to ''despise'' Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  in 2008, he learned to appreciate how well informed and hard-working she was as secretary of state. Today he says he is a fan.\par \par \uc2 ''I believe, with Hillary, that we are stronger together,'' he said, ''and that this country is a better place when you expand the opportunities to every single person: rich, poor, Muslim, Mexican, gay, woman.''\par \par \uc2 Mr. Favreau caught himself slipping into speechmaking mode and laughed.\par \par \uc2 ''Whatever I do in life, I end up in the same place,'' he said. ''Writing about politics, talking about politics. I tried to quit. I can't quit.''\par \par \uc2 Continue following our fashion and lifestyle coverage on \uc2 Facebook\uc2  (Styles and Modern Love), \uc2 Twitter\uc2  (Styles, Fashion and Weddings) and \uc2 Instagram\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Correction: July 31, 2016, Sunday\par \par \uc2 This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article last Sunday about the former White House speechwriter \uc2 Jon Favreau\uc2  referred incorrectly to the political office held by \uc2 Barack Obama\uc2  when he spoke at the 2004 Democratic National Convention. He was a candidate that year for the \uc2 United States Senate\uc2  seat from Illinois; he had not yet been elected to that post.\par \par \uc2 Jon Favreau left the world of politics to run a communications consulting firm.

\par\par \uc2 OP-ED COLUMNIST\par \uc2 Sunday Review Desk; SECTSR\par \b \uc2 Behind Hillary's Mask\b0\par\par\uc2 By GAIL COLLINS \par \uc2 1,692 \uc2 words\par \uc2 24 July 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 1\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 RIGHT after the Sept. 11 attacks, I ran into \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  outside an armory in Manhattan that served as a sort of clearing house for tragedy, where people brought pictures of the missing and checked for information. She talked for a long time, very freely, about Washington politicians who had always hated New York but were turning out to be helpful in the crisis.\par \par \uc2 The conversation was memorable not for the information but for her manner. For all her intensity about the city, \uc2 Clinton\uc2  was more relaxed than I'd ever seen her while chatting with a member of the press. She was operating in a new space -- for the moment, no one really cared that she was a senator who'd gotten elected from a state she'd never lived in, the survivor of the best-known political sex scandal in American history, the former first lady who ran for office while her husband was still president. The country had temporarily lost interest in celebrities, and she seemed to find her relative insignificance liberating.\par \par \uc2 When \uc2 Clinton\uc2  is nominated for president later this week in Philadelphia, we'll be talking about her as the first woman to get a crack at running the country. But she'd also be one of the most famous people ever to get the honor. In America, she's been part of the backdrop of our lives for nearly a quarter of a century. We're watching a very familiar face making a brand-new mark on history.\par \par \uc2 In 2000, when she first ran for the Senate, the fact that New York had never sent a woman to the Senate was an afterthought, given all the other stuff there was to consider. ''It was the first time I'd been a candidate and the first time I'd lived in New York,'' she recalled in a phone interview. The very idea of that race was incredible -- maybe outrageous. And it didn't begin well. She had trouble with the carpetbagging issue. At one point, \uc2 Clinton\uc2  attempted to woo the locals by claiming that although she'd been brought up as a \uc2 Chicago Cubs\uc2  fan, she had always rooted for the \uc2 Yankees\uc2  because people need a team in each league. This was contradictory to every law of Midwestern fandom, which holds that no matter what else you do, hating the \uc2 New York Yankees\uc2  is a central principle of life.\par \par \uc2 Then she turned everything around. Went on an endless ''listening tour'' of such anti-glamorous, earnest wonkiness that reporters who trailed after her from town to town began to develop nervous tics and drinking issues. But it was the perfect strategy. By the end, she had worn down her aura of outsiderdom. And she seemed to be enjoying herself. While all politicians at her level have stupendously sturdy egos, \uc2 Clinton\uc2  does appear to get a certain relief being in venues where the focus is on somebody else.\par \par \uc2 That year on the trail, \uc2 Clinton\uc2  wore the very same thing almost every day, a black pantsuit with a bright blouse. It seemed like a stroke of genius -- proof that female candidates could eliminate the endless clothing commentary by simply doing what guys do and wearing interchangeable outfits. Later, of course, she'd go back to her romance with jewel tones, and by 2008, reporters would sometimes post the color of the day at the back of the press plane. I asked her once why she'd given up the original outfit plan and she said she just got bored.\par \par \uc2 The thing I remember most about those trips from Oneonta to Cooperstown to Horseheads -- besides the tedium -- was the intense reaction she got from middle-aged women, who yelled and waved and begged for autographs. They were the ones who remembered what it was like when the newspapers had separate ''help wanted'' columns for men and women, who needed a male co-signer when they got their first car loans. I suspected that a lot of them, like me, still had credit cards in their husbands' names because that was just the way things worked when they first began to charge stuff at \uc2 Macy's\uc2  or use \uc2 American Express\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 And there was something else. \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  represented the possibility of a second act. The country was full of women who had come of age with the women's revolution, who had tried to have it all, raising children while having good -- but maybe not spectacular -- careers. Now there was the about-to-retire first lady, in her new persona, suggesting they might be able to start a whole new episode in life. Driving around through upstate New York, \uc2 Clinton\uc2  was in the home territory of Susan B. Anthony and Elizabeth Cady Stanton, who had broken the old rules about staying home, rearing the kids and then retiring to a rocking chair.\par \par \uc2 Stanton in particular argued that instead of the end, middle age could be a jumping-off point for adventure. You could do all the things you weren't able to do when the children were young -- you could travel, make speeches, start newspapers, lead rallies. You could do things no women had done before in the public arena, because you looked mature and trustworthy and people could see you had paid your dues. The prospect was so exciting, women began writing paeans to menopause as a time for ''superexaltation.''\par \par \uc2 O.K., none of that specifically came up during the listening tours. But I swear it was there in the background.\par \par \uc2 When the campaign was over, \uc2 Clinton\uc2  was in fact elected the first woman senator from New York, although she says she was ''too busy learning about dairy compacts and watersheds'' to think much about the feminist-history angle. Even when she ran for president in 2008, she didn't usually make it a specific campaign theme. But gender was on her mind. She frequently told audiences that her mother had been born before women had the right to vote. And when her chances of winning got increasingly slim, she'd complain, in private, that some Obama people seemed to think she was going to automatically get out of the way and defer to what the guys wanted. ''I'm not going to tell my daughter, 'Oh, I quit, because I'm the girl and they're all being mean to me,' '' she said at one point.\par \par \uc2 Over the last eight years, \uc2 Clinton\uc2  has grown more comfortable stressing the idea of becoming the first woman to serve as president. She thinks it really came into focus after she lost in 2008 and made that speech about putting 18 million cracks in the glass ceiling.\par \par \uc2 ''This time I decided I'd be more explicit,'' she said, and ''make it part of the campaign.''\par \par \uc2 Because this is a story about \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  you know this upbeat resolution is going to be followed by a problem. Young women are not universally crazy about the first-woman thing. Some just see her as an imperfect candidate. For others, it's because the whole gender thing seems like yesterday's news. ''There aren't as many overt questions about 'Can a woman do it? Is it something the country is ready for?' '' \uc2 Clinton\uc2  acknowledged.\par \par \uc2 That's probably true, and if it is, she deserves a lot of the credit. You can argue the pros and cons of \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's character, or her potential to change the nation, or her position on trade policy. But you can never take away the fact that she was the one who made the idea of a woman becoming president so normal that many young women are bored by it.\par \par \uc2 Clinton\uc2  comes out of a very specific zone of American high school culture in the middle of the 20th century -- the girls behind the homecoming float-building committee. (She tells a story in her autobiography about being told as a teenager that she was ''really stupid'' to think she could be senior class president, losing the \uc2 election\uc2  and then agreeing to run the committee that did all the behind-the-scenes work.) She drew a terrible straw in 2008, when she had to run against a guy who was not only a making-history candidate himself, but also clearly a member of the prom king sector. Now she's pitted against the rich kid who throws wild parties when his parents are out of town.\par \par \uc2 The Republican convention last week made it clear how vicious this campaign is going to be -- the only real platform appeared to be the desirability of locking \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  up, and she was blamed for everything from ISIS to the kidnapping of Nigerian schoolgirls. \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  painted a picture of a wrecked, emasculated America in a dystopian world created by Obama-\uc2 Clinton\uc2  malfeasance. We don't know yet whether \uc2 Clinton\uc2  can counter forcefully with a sunnier vision. What we do know is that she won't be cowed.\par \par \uc2 Whatever her defects, she is a candidate with a very long and event-filled history of toughing things out, who finds solace in stupendously hard work and in doing her homework. She's one of the best-known people on the planet, but she can happily spend a day listening to complaints about watershed pollution or flying halfway around the world to sit through a conference on sustainable development.\par \par \uc2 When she was still secretary of state, I asked \uc2 Clinton\uc2  about another presidential campaign and she waved the idea aside. Her future plans, she said, involved sleeping and exercising and traveling for fun. ''It sounds so ordinary, but I haven't done it for 20 years. I would like to see whether I can get untired,'' she said.\par \par \uc2 She may never find out.\par \par \uc2 I invite you to join me on \uc2 Facebook\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Follow The \uc2 New York Times\uc2  Opinion section on \uc2 Facebook\uc2  and \uc2 Twitter\uc2  (@NYTopinion), and sign up for the Opinion Today newsletter.\par \par \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  visiting a school during her Senate campaign in New York in 2000.

\par\par \uc2 Politics; SECT\par \b \uc2 Influential Donors Criticize Ted Cruz for His G.O.P. Convention Speech\b0\par\par\uc2 By MAGGIE HABERMAN \par \uc2 660 \uc2 words\par \uc2 24 July 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 The New York Times on the Web\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 In an extraordinary public rebuke, two influential donors who were among the biggest supporters of Senator Ted Cruz's presidential campaign excoriated Mr. Cruz on Saturday for his decision not to endorse \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2  at the Republican National Convention.\par \par \uc2 The remarks from Robert Mercer of Long Island and his daughter Rebekah Mercer suggest widening fallout over Mr. Cruz's convention speech, in which he did not endorse his former rival and, instead, suggested that Republicans should ''vote your conscience'' for candidates ''up and down the ticket.''\par \par \uc2 ''Last summer and again this year, Senator Ted Cruz pledged to support the candidacy of the nominee of the Republican Party, whomever that nominee might be,'' the Mercers, who rarely comment in the news media, said in the statement to The \uc2 New York Times\uc2 . ''We are profoundly disappointed that on Wednesday night he chose to disregard this pledge.''\par \par \uc2 The statement continued: ''The Democratic Party will soon choose as their nominee a candidate who would repeal both the First and Second Amendments of the Bill of Rights, a nominee who would remake the Supreme Court in her own image. We need 'all hands on deck' to ensure that Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  prevails.''\par \par \uc2 ''Unfortunately,'' the statement added, ''Senator Cruz has chosen to remain in his bunk below, a decision both regrettable and revealing.''\par \par \uc2 The Mercers invested at least $11 million in Keep the Promise I, one of a group of interlocked ''super PACs'' that supported Mr. Cruz in his presidential run. During the contentious primary race, Mr. Cruz had early praise for Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  on the belief that his candidacy would eventually fade and that Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's voters would move over to the senator's camp.\par \par \uc2 Instead, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's candidacy endured and the race between the men grew increasingly rancorous.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Cruz is up for re-\uc2 election\uc2  in 2018 and is said to be looking at a second campaign for president in 2020, should Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  lose in November. But, in both cases, he will need his donor base to stay with him.\par \par \uc2 After Mr. Cruz's speech at the convention in Cleveland, Sheldon G. Adelson, the casino magnate who was an early admirer of Mr. Cruz in the primaries, blocked him from his suite. (A friend of Mr. Adelson's, claiming to represent him, insisted after the fact that he was not trying to disrespect the senator.)\par \par \uc2 The next morning, Mr. Cruz was booed by members of the Texas delegation at a breakfast.\par \par \uc2 A spokeswoman for Mr. Cruz, Catherine Frazier, said on Saturday: ''Senator Cruz considers Bob and Rebekah to be patriots and friends. As Senator Cruz urged in Cleveland, \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  would be a disaster for America. Republicans need to unite, and the only way to unite is behind shared principles. His speech laid out a path -- vigorously defending freedom and the Constitution -- for our nominee to unite the party and for Republicans to win up and down the ticket.''\par \par \uc2 Mr. Mercer in recent weeks has helped fund a new effort for donors who want to defeat Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , but who do not want to donate to a group that is openly supporting Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 . That group is being operated by \uc2 David Bossie\uc2 , the president of the group \uc2 Citizens United\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Kellyanne Conway, who was the president of a pro-Cruz super PAC and now is an adviser to Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , said the statement reflects the Mercers' feelings about defeating Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  in the fall and ''how grievously piqued they were to watch Ted's convention stunt on Wednesday night.''\par \par \uc2 Ms. Conway added, ''They supported Ted because they thought he was a man of his word who, like them, would place love of country over personal feelings or political ambition.''\par \par \uc2 Find out what you need to know about the 2016 presidential race today, and get politics news updates via \uc2 Facebook\uc2 , \uc2 Twitter\uc2  and the First Draft newsletter.\par \par \uc2 Document NYTF000020160724ec7o00058\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 This article has been updated to reflect news events.\par \par \uc2 YOU can tell a lot about a person by whom they choose to marry. As the nominees selected at this week's Republican National Convention and next week's Democratic one take the stage along with their family members, they will display not only stark policy differences, but also two competing views of marriage, kin and the role of women in society. What we saw from Republicans: Men who want their wives at home while they celebrate the professional successes of their daughters.\par \par \uc2 The Republican Party has long praised traditional family values and intrinsic differences between men and women, while Democrats emphasize egalitarianism and expanding opportunities for women and girls. Few candidates in recent history have embodied those dissimilarities in such sharp relief as \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  and \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2 . On Monday night, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's wife, Melania, spoke about her husband and their family values. The speech was, like the woman herself, fairly unobjectionable on its face, with platitudes about family and country, patriotism and hard work. Like much of the \uc2 Trump\uc2  image, though, the shiny veneer hid shoddy construction: The very same parts of the speech that lauded integrity, hard work and honesty were lifted almost word for word from Michelle Obama's 2008 convention speech.\par \par \uc2 It seems not even purported \uc2 Trump\uc2  family values are authentic. To borrow from Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 : sad.\par \par \uc2 One traditional value Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  does hew to: wanting an old-fashioned wife but a modern, professional daughter. On Thursday, convention-goers heard from the elder \uc2 Trump\uc2  daughter, Ivanka, a successful businesswoman whose feminism-tinged speech about the gender wage gap and affordable child care sounded less like any policy positions ever pushed by Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  and more like her book-in-progress, ''Women Who Work.'' They also witnessed how the \uc2 Trump\uc2  family embodies a very old sexist hypocrisy: Men who want one thing for their wives and another for their children.\par \par \uc2 While \uc2 Trump\uc2  family values may not be particularly honorable, they are perversely traditional. Melania \uc2 Trump\uc2  told the R.N.C. audience that ''Donald is intensely loyal to family,'' a claim belied by his own marital history -- she is wife No. 3, and No. 2 was the woman with whom he cheated on No 1. Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  has children with three different women; he blames giving his wife too much responsibility in his business for his first divorce, and his wife's wanting him to spend too much time at home with her and their daughter for his second.\par \par \uc2 The qualities Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  seeks in his romantic partners are remarkably retro. Melania \uc2 Trump\uc2  is a former model with her own QVC jewelry line and skin care brand who emphasizes that her role as a mother comes before all else; Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  has spoken disparagingly of working women, does little in the way of child care, and expects women to be more aesthetically appealing than intellectually substantive. ''We know our roles,'' his wife has said. ''I didn't want him to change the diapers or put Barron to bed.'' Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  agrees: ''I won't do anything'' to take care of the children, he told \uc2 Howard Stern\uc2  in 2005. ''I'll supply funds and she'll take care of the kids.'' By contrast, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  took out a campaign ad featuring Ivanka, and said of her: ''I am so proud of Ivanka. She is a terrific person, a devoted mother and an exceptional entrepreneur.''\par \par \uc2 It can feel unfair to criticize political spouses, who are often dragged into the spotlight only because of whom they married. Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , though, is running for office, making his treatment of women -- personal and political -- as relevant as his treatment of his employees or business partners. The distinctions between the \uc2 Clinton\uc2  marriage and the Trumps' reflect an uncomfortable evolution also happening in homes across the United States. In the past half-century, American women have undergone a transformation in roles, and married couples now look a lot more like the Clintons -- or \uc2 Ivanka \uc2 Trump\uc2  and her husband, \uc2 Jared Kushner\uc2  -- than whatever traditional view of women and home life that Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  holds: Most women work outside the home full time, and men increasingly marry women who are their educational and professional equals.\par \par \uc2 But the public remains deeply ambivalent about these shifts. Today, 40 percent of women are their family's primary breadwinners, and nearly 80 percent of Americans agree that women should not return to traditional roles in society. A third still say it's best for small children if Mom doesn't work at all. The Republican Party has particularly struggled to accept this new model, and still pushes back on women's progress by opposing policies that would help women work and plan their families: things like federally funded child care, paid parental leave and access to birth control. \uc2 Ivanka \uc2 Trump\uc2 's speech on Thursday was closer to a laundry list of the very policies Democrats have promoted and Republicans have tried to block.\par \par \uc2 And like Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  praising his daughter's business acumen, men want different things in their wives than in their daughters. Changing gender roles look less threatening when it's their children who benefit. According to a survey published by Maria Shriver's Shriver Report, American men listed ''intelligence'' as the top quality they valued in both a wife and a daughter, but then the responses split: More men said they wanted their wives to be attractive and sweet than said the same about their female children. For daughters, men ranked being independent, strong and principled as more important qualities than those same characteristics in wives. Two-thirds of men want an independent daughter, but only one in three wants an independent wife. Fourteen percent of men said they wanted a wife who was a homemaker; just 5 percent said the same about their daughters.\par \par \uc2 This dynamic seems to play out in the \uc2 Trump\uc2  family: Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's wife is professionally attractive, anecdotally nice and by her own telling fairly traditional, while his elder daughter is a strong, independent and well-educated businesswoman who was mentored by her father and rose to prominence inside his companies. Ivanka has been more publicly involved in the campaign than her stepmother, serving as something of a surrogate spouse to Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  by defending his treatment of women and emphasizing his good character. And it was Ivanka, not Melania \uc2 Trump\uc2 , who not only introduced Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  as the Republican Party nominee on Thursday night, but highlighted what he would do in office to help women.\par \par \uc2 This female empowerment narrative -- of the daughter, not the wife -- is one Americans are more ready to accept. A man who says he's never changed a diaper and is on his third marriage to a former model may appeal to a resentful male minority, but will look unfamiliar and unappealing in much of the country. A successful child, though -- that's relatable and desirable. When men have daughters, their attitudes shift and they begin to adhere less stringently to traditional gender roles; no similar effect happens to mothers of girls. Fathers of daughters are also more likely to support reproductive rights than men who don't have girls.\par \par \uc2 Men have often given their female offspring more opportunities than their female partners, perhaps seeing their children as extensions of themselves. Even today, many men find themselves newly appalled at sexism after having a girl, a reaction apparently not stoked by being born of a woman, married to a woman or simply seeing women as human. In our reluctantly feminist America, one question this \uc2 election\uc2  poses is whether we've evolved enough to value women as individuals instead of assessing them relationally, as an attractive wife supporting her husband or as a high-achieving daughter reflecting a flattering light back on her parents.\par \par \uc2 It's a question Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  has addressed in his personal life. His answer isn't very pretty.\par \par \uc2 Follow The \uc2 New York Times\uc2  Opinion section on \uc2 Facebook\uc2  and \uc2 Twitter\uc2  (@NYTOpinion), and sign up for the Opinion Today newsletter.\par \par \uc2 Jill Filipovic, a journalist and lawyer, is the author of the forthcoming ''The H-Spot: The Feminist Pursuit of Happiness.''\par \par \uc2 Donald, Melania and Ivanka \uc2 Trump\uc2  in Florida in 2014.

He was 86.\par \par \uc2 His death was confirmed by his wife, Lynn.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Horowitz, a former film studio executive who also masterminded winning Oscar campaigns for, among other blockbusters, ''The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King,'' played a role in brokering Mr. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's appearance on ''The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson'' after Mr. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  bombed in what was supposed to be, literally, his 15 minutes of fame at the 1988 Democratic National Convention.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  spoke for more than twice that long, delivering a 33-minute nominating speech for Gov. Michael S. Dukakis of Massachusetts. The speech was intended to introduce Mr. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , then the governor of Arkansas, to the American television public, but it lost the attention of the delegates long before he uttered the two words that generated the greatest applause: ''In conclusion.''\par \par \uc2 In an interview for an episode of the PBS program ''American Experience,'' Mr. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's friend Harry Thomason, a television producer and director, recalled how he and his wife and producing partner, Linda Bloodworth-Thomason, responded to the speech that night.\par \par \uc2 ''We were very upset, you know, that it didn't go well,'' he said. ''And we knew the press was going to make mincemeat out of him and people would be making fun of him. So we stew about it all night; this is a Thursday, you know. Sometime in the wee hours Linda wakes me up after a troubled sleep and she said, 'Look, he's got to go on the Carson show to make this right.'''\par \par \uc2 They called Mr. Horowitz the next morning. Mr. Horowitz contacted Mr. Carson's producer, Fred de Cordova, ''and he says Carson has never had a politician on his show in his entire career and he's not going to now,'' Mr. Thomason said.\par \par \uc2 ''And I said, O.K.,'' he continued, ''and so sometime after lunch I thought of another idea and I just called Freddie de Cordova back direct and I said, 'O.K., you've never had a politician on, but what if he comes on and plays the saxophone?'''\par \par \uc2 Mr. Carson had joked after the speech that ''the surgeon general has just approved \uc2 Bill \uc2 Clinton\uc2  as an over-the-counter sleep aid.'' He placed a hourglass on his desk when Mr. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  sat down for the interview.\par \par \uc2 But the next day, after Mr. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  played his saxophone on the air, The Associated Press declared: ''Arkansas Gov. Bill \uc2 Clinton\uc2  has gone from the media doghouse to media darling in one short week. And all it took was a smile, a few self-deprecating jokes and a song.''\par \par \uc2 Four years later Mr. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  was pursuing the Democratic presidential nomination, and Mr. Horowitz arranged for him and \uc2 Hillary Rodham \uc2 Clinton\uc2  to appear on ''The Arsenio Hall Show'' the day after the California primary, as his media adviser, Mandy Grunwald, had been recommending for months.\par \par \uc2 While Mr. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  had clinched the Democratic nomination, his appearance (he donned dark glasses and played ''Heartbreak Hotel'') helped humanize him for a challenging fall campaign in which he started in third place against George H. W. Bush and H. Ross Perot. (''It's nice to see a Democrat blow something besides the \uc2 election\uc2 ,'' Mr. Hall said.)\par \par \uc2 ''\uc2 Bill \uc2 Clinton\uc2  may have discovered the formula to revive his stalled campaign: Exploit his sax appeal,'' Walter Shapiro wrote in Time magazine later that month.\par \par \uc2 David Herbert Horowitz was born in Brooklyn on July 21, 1929, to Irving Horowitz and the former Lenore Demain. Irving Horowitz owned drugstores and ran a food-processing company,\par \par \uc2 David Horowitz is survived by his wife, the former Lynn Rockman.\par \par \uc2 After moving to California as a boy, Mr. Horowitz graduated from the \uc2 University of California, Los Angeles\uc2 , where, after a summer job with an advertising agency, he changed his plan, which had been to study medicine.\par \par \uc2 He became an executive at \uc2 Warner Bros\uc2 . and TriStar and advocated with his clients on behalf of social causes, including civil and American Indian rights.\par \par \uc2 The wide-ranging roster of clients he worked closely with included Barbra Streisand, Harry Belafonte, Bette Davis, Katharine Hepburn, Robert Redford, Billy Wilder and the Muppets.\par \par \uc2 He once recalled that he became a publicist when he applied for a job with the director Robert Aldrich, who asked about his experience.\par \par \uc2 ''Well, I do know advertising, but, actually, nothing about publicity,'' he remembered saying. Mr. Aldrich, he said, replied: ''You're hired. You're the first honest publicist I've ever met.''\par \par \uc2 David Horowitz \par \par \uc2 Document NYTF000020160724ec7o0006d\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

Jonathan Martin contributed reporting from Philadelphia. \par \uc2 1,302 \uc2 words\par \uc2 24 July 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 1\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 MIAMI -- \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  debuted her running mate, Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia, to boisterous and bilingual cheers here on Saturday, calling him a ''progressive who likes to get things done'' even as some liberal Democrats began making clear that they were disappointed with her choice.\par \par \uc2 ''I have to say, Senator Tim Kaine is everything that \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  and \uc2 Mike Pence\uc2  are not,'' Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  said, drawing a quick contrast with the Republican ticket as she introduced her own No. 2 to the nation.\par \par \uc2 Appearing comfortable in his new role as Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's top cheerleader and weapon against Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , Mr. Kaine bounded up to the microphone, then slipped easily between English and Spanish as he animated the mostly Latino audience by mixing political talk with homey reflections on his life.\par \par \uc2 ''Fe, familia y trabajo,'' he told the crowd of more than 5,000 people at \uc2 Florida International University\uc2 , explaining that faith, family and work defined his life.\par \par \uc2 But as Mr. Kaine sought to flex his language skills to appeal to Hispanic voters, he and Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  were also trying to mollify a growing backlash from the left against his record of support for global trade deals, which many voters in Rust Belt states blame for the loss of American manufacturing jobs.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Kaine was one of 13 Senate Democrats to vote in support of giving President Obama ''fast track'' authority on the Trans-Pacific Partnership, the 12-nation pact that has become a lightning rod this \uc2 election\uc2  year. In a clear sign of concern that the issue could be damaging, aides to both Democrats signaled on Saturday that Mr. Kaine would soon publicly adopt Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's current position on the deal and say that he no longer supported it in its current form.\par \par \uc2 After praising the Trans-Pacific Partnership as secretary of state, Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  said during the Democratic primary race against Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont that the pact did not meet her ''high bar'' on protecting American workers.\par \par \uc2 Progressive groups have offered mixed reviews of Mr. Kaine, with MoveOn.org Political Action saying it supports him in light of the ''racist, bigoted'' message coming from Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Democracy for America\uc2 , a liberal group that backed Mr. Sanders, agreed with the anti-\uc2 Trump\uc2  sentiment but said the selection of Mr. Kaine was not helpful to the progressive movement.\par \par \uc2 ''Kaine's support for fast-track authority for the job-killing Trans-Pacific Partnership and recent backing of bank deregulation will make our work more difficult,'' said Charles Chamberlain, the executive director of Democracy for America.\par \par \uc2 Liberals looking for a sign from Mr. Sanders himself did not immediately get one.\par \par \uc2 Shortly after Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  offered Mr. Kaine a spot on the ticket, he called Mr. Sanders. But Mr. Sanders, who endorsed Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  only about two weeks ago, did not comment about her vice-presidential selection or mention it on \uc2 Twitter\uc2  on Saturday. A spokesman said Mr. Sanders would most likely discuss the pick in his interviews on Sunday talk shows.\par \par \uc2 Some supporters of Mr. Sanders on social media said the choice of Mr. Kaine was more evidence that their ''Bernie or Bust'' missions must continue. Others who were resigned to Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , however, said they could live with her decision. ''He is more than competent for the job,'' said Steve Todd, a delegate for Mr. Sanders from Pennsylvania.\par \par \uc2 Larry Cohen, an adviser to the Sanders campaign and a former president of the Communications Workers of America, said of Mr. Kaine, ''People are minimizing the range of this man by putting him in some box I would argue he doesn't belong.''\par \par \uc2 Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  and Mr. Kaine sought to address the complaints head-on. Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  highlighted his work on fair housing issues and gun control in the aftermath of the \uc2 Virginia Tech\uc2  shooting that killed 32 people in 2007, when Mr. Kaine was the governor. ''Make no mistake,'' Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  said. ''Behind that smile, Tim also has a backbone of steel. Just ask the N.R.A.''\par \par \uc2 The rollout of Mr. Kaine's candidacy in Florida was no accident.\par \par \uc2 The state is a crucial battleground, and Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  is moving to press her advantage with the state's Hispanic voters, many of whom have been turned off by Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's hard-line immigration policies.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Kaine, who took a year off from Harvard Law School to work with Jesuit missionaries in Honduras, wasted little time showing off his bilingualism, often thrusting his fist in the air and looking back and flashing a wide grin at Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , who sat on a stool behind him.\par \par \uc2 ''Bienvenidos!'' he told those in the crowd, welcoming them in Spanish and declaring that he and Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  would be ''compa\u241\'00\'F1eros de alma in this great lucha ahead,'' Spanish (mostly) for ''soul mates in the fight ahead.''\par \par \uc2 Mr. Kaine offered a folksy emotiveness that could ease concerns among Democrats that Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  appears too stilted and scripted at times. Mr. Kaine, who dislikes teleprompters, often veered off his prepared remarks, seeming elated to be under such a bright spotlight.\par \par \uc2 Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  seemed to feed off the energy her new running mate gave the crowd as he alternated between zingers about Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  and a bit of braggadocio.\par \par \uc2 ''I've never lost an \uc2 election\uc2 ,'' Mr. Kaine said. ''I'm not about to let that change.''\par \par \uc2 Discussing how he weathers attacks from the \uc2 National Rifle Association\uc2  and other groups, he said, ''That's just like an extra cup of coffee to me, folks.''\par \par \uc2 David Axelrod, a former chief strategist for Mr. Obama, criticized Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's delivery, writing on \uc2 Twitter\uc2  that ''someone, at long last, needs to urge her to let the mic do the work!'' But he praised Mr. Kaine as ''natural, engaging, connecting.''\par \par \uc2 In an implicit contrast with Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's rollout of Mr. Pence, when he dominated the microphone as his vice-presidential candidate stood silently for much of the time, Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  perched on a stool, nodding and cheering, behind Mr. Kaine as he spoke for about 40 minutes.\par \par \uc2 During Mr. Kaine's speech, the \uc2 Trump\uc2  campaign sent out emails in rapid succession, citing his ''job-crushing'' record in Virginia, claiming he lacked any achievements as governor and deriding him as a career politician.\par \par \uc2 After a search that began in April, Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's advisers hoped Mr. Kaine could help her bridge the wide divide she faces with male voters, who favor Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  by 13 percentage points, according to the latest New York Times/CBS News poll. White men favor Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  by 26 percentage points.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Kaine's positions on trade could also hurt the Democratic ticket in this regard. Part of Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's appeal has been his steadfast, if unspecific, promise to bring jobs back to economically depressed parts of the country, largely attributing the decline to the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which his own running mate also supported.\par \par \uc2 ''Tim Kaine has been praising the Trans-Pacific Partnership and has been pushing hard to get it approved,'' Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  posted on \uc2 Twitter\uc2  on Saturday.

\par\par \uc2 National Desk; SECTA\par \b \uc2 Democrats, Looking Past \uc2 Obama\uc2 , Feel Around for a Next Great Cause (Infrastructure?)\b0\par\par\uc2 By JONATHAN MARTIN \par \uc2 1,543 \uc2 words\par \uc2 24 July 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 10\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 PHILADELPHIA -- When President \uc2 Obama\uc2  takes the stage here this week to begin his monthslong political farewell, it will mark a bittersweet moment for Democrats.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Obama is not going to be missed only because he is beloved by the faithful. The president has also fulfilled two longstanding if often elusive goals of his party: He has largely transcended the traditional moderate-versus-liberal split, papering over internal divisions. And he passed a sweeping health care law.\par \par \uc2 But without the unifying presence of Mr. Obama in the White House, or the organizing aim of expanding health care, it is unclear who will hold the party together and what will be the next great project of liberalism.\par \par \uc2 For the moment, \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  and her party have an industrial-strength adhesive: keeping \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2  out of the Oval Office. But interviews with a range of Democrats indicate that, if Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  is elected, she will lead a party that is unified around social tolerance, but sharply divided over how to achieve economic justice in an era of upheaval.\par \par \uc2 There is still a shared view that broadening opportunity for all remains at the heart of the Democratic Party. ''The bumper sticker is now 'income fairness,''' said \uc2 Barney Frank\uc2 , a former Massachusetts congressman.\par \par \uc2 Yet there is no consensus over how to address the country's persistent wage stagnation, or even if any sweeping legislation can be achieved at all in a time of deepening polarization and when the Republican Party has little desire to compromise.\par \par \uc2 For now, many in the party whose presidents ushered in Social Security, the G.I. Bill and civil rights seem most focused on infrastructure.\par \par \uc2 It is hardly the stuff of the Great Society, a moonshot or even ''a chicken in every pot.'' But there is a view among Democrats that rebuilding the country's roads, bridges, airports and railways represents an opportunity to use government in a way that can create jobs, appeal to both wings of their own party and win over some Republicans, who may have a difficult time saying no to an infusion of money for their states and districts.\par \par \uc2 ''Who's against infrastructure?'' \uc2 Gov. Terry McAuliffe\uc2  of Virginia said.\par \par \uc2 Mr. McAuliffe, a close friend and ally of the Clintons, said that in his new capacity as chairman of the National Governors Association he would convene an infrastructure summit meeting with the nation's governors immediately after the \uc2 election\uc2  to build momentum for a bill and exert pressure on congressional Republicans.\par \par \uc2 Yet beyond this short-term objective, there are clashing views about how to further the cause of economic equality at a moment of technological transformation. Centrist Democrats are focused largely on changes to the tax code, work-force development and other incremental steps to help people adjust to a shifting workplace.\par \par \uc2 ''We all believe in economic opportunity for everybody,'' Gov. Jack Markell of Delaware said. ''The difference between myself and Senator Sanders and Senator Warren,'' he added, referring to Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, ''is they think that's not happening because the system is rigged, and I think it's not happening because the system is changing.''\par \par \uc2 The strength of Mr. Sanders's campaign, however, has emboldened liberals and made them unwilling to settle for small-bore changes to the political system.\par \par \uc2 ''Many working people were inspired by his message of aiming higher, not for continuity,'' said Larry Cohen, the former president of the communications workers' union and a prominent backer of Mr. Sanders. Echoing the former candidate, Mr. Cohen said major changes were needed to the country's campaign finance laws, banks and trade laws.\par \par \uc2 ''The way we put food on the table and higher education within reach is to create a democracy where working people count as much as wealthy people,'' he said.\par \par \uc2 Mary Kay Henry\uc2 , the president of the service workers' union, said the party's liberal platform reflected Democrats' ''choice to meet the moment'' and the pressure that progressive activists have applied to the party elite.\par \par \uc2 ''We think that government now has to play a role in backing the collective action happening all across the progressive movement,'' Ms. Henry said, pointing to efforts to organize fast-food workers as one example.\par \par \uc2 Ilya Sheyman, the executive director of the progressive MoveOn.org, said it would be incumbent on Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  to fight for the parts of Mr. Sanders's populist agenda she has embraced. ''If she runs on those ideas, forces Republicans to take tough votes, then ultimately the voters will reward the party that speaks to their economic concerns,'' he said.\par \par \uc2 But for Democrats facing re-\uc2 election\uc2  in two years, especially in more competitive parts of the country, there is more of an appetite for conciliation than for confrontation.\par \par \uc2 ''It's important to show the American people that Washington can work,'' said Senator Claire McCaskill of Missouri. ''I personally feel urgency about getting some things done.''\par \par \uc2 ''Purity tests,'' said Senator Mark Warner of Virginia, ''are not a recipe for getting things done.''\par \par \uc2 Even if Democrats could agree on their next grand ambition, it would be difficult to push through a Congress where at least one chamber is likely to still be controlled by Republicans.\par \par \uc2 House Speaker Paul D. Ryan, as Ms. McCaskill ruefully noted, is unlikely to take up legislation to make college tuition-free. (Mr. Obama signed the Affordable Care Act at a time when his party had overwhelming majorities in both the House and the Senate.)\par \par \uc2 So what to do when facing the demands of an energized left in a period of divided government?\par \par \uc2 Some of Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's allies say they expect she would compromise to make what progress she can.\par \par \uc2 ''In a second,'' Mr. McAuliffe said of Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's willingness to make deals. ''She is a pragmatic leader who will work with anybody to push the ball forward.''\par \par \uc2 Even some progressives acknowledge that the near term will require patience.\par \par \uc2 ''Incrementalism has always been embedded in the zeitgeist of being a Democrat,'' said Stacey Abrams, minority leader of the Georgia House. ''Our grand monuments took decades to build. We remember the victories, but too often we forget the game.''\par \par \uc2 Ms. Abrams pointed to a need for progress on crucial quality-of-life issues, made more urgent by changes in the family and workplace that she said highlighted the need for expanded family leave and child-care benefits.\par \par \uc2 ''Democrats are the architects of health care and Social Security,'' she said, ''but now that we've got the foundation in place, we need the caulking that holds society together.''\par \par \uc2 Mr. Warner has also been focused on the passing of laws to better reflect the country's shifting economy. ''Thirty-five percent of the work force is at some level of contingent work status,'' he said. ''But the social contract is set up on the basis of the full-time worker. So we need portable benefits now.''\par \par \uc2 Other Democrats, including those at the influential \uc2 Center for American Progress\uc2 . a left-leaning policy institute, have been aggressively calling for laws that will encourage corporations to share profits with employees. ''It is not the sexiest of topics,'' conceded Neera Tanden, the group's president.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Frank, the former congressman, reeled off a litany of steps that could be taken, including a higher minimum wage, easier access to higher education, a more pro-union \uc2 National Labor Relations Board\uc2  and the infrastructure bill.\par \par \uc2 If it is all something of a scattershot approach, that is in part because if reflects both the political limitations of the moment and the thorny nature of addressing economic opportunity at a time of persistent wage stagnation.\par \par \uc2 But Democrats take solace in what has taken place in this most unlikely of elections, with an avowed democratic socialist emerging as a political force in the Democratic Party and the Republican Party being seized by a candidate who ran explicitly against key elements of the party's free-market orthodoxy.\par \par \uc2 ''If you look at \uc2 Trump\uc2  voters and you look at our primary, there seems to be willingness for bolder answers,'' Ms. Tanden said. ''We can't reach \uc2 Trump\uc2  voters on nativism, but we can reach them on bolder answers to economic challenges.''\par \par \uc2 Indeed, many Democrats believe that Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's populism has sent a shudder through Republican ranks, driving home the need to respond to economic anxieties with something more potent than tax cuts.\par \par \uc2 Or as Mr. Frank put it: ''Every time we used to bring up income inequality, we were dismissed with two words: class warfare. Well, that ended this year.''\par \par \uc2 Find out what you need to know about the 2016 presidential race today, and get politics news updates via \uc2 Facebook\uc2 , \uc2 Twitter\uc2  and the First Draft newsletter.\par \par \uc2 President Obama, at the G-7 summit in Japan in May, has largely transcended the Democrats' usual moderate-versus-liberal divisions, and led the singular cause of expanding health care.

\par\par \uc2 AD OF THE WEEK\par \uc2 National Desk; SECTA\par \b \uc2 An Upbeat Approach for the \uc2 Trump\uc2  Camp\b0\par\par\uc2 By NICK CORASANITI \par \uc2 700 \uc2 words\par \uc2 24 July 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 15\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 For months now, \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  and her Democratic allies have been hammering \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2  on the air, and Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  has barely bothered to hit back at all. But as he emerges from the Republican convention, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  is at last receiving some meaningful air support: Rebuilding America Now, one of the ''super PACs'' supporting his campaign, is releasing four new ads -- including a 60-second commercial, ''America Soaring'' -- in swing states on Monday.\par \par \uc2 THE MESSAGE American steel, American jobs, America first. It's the cinematic, polished version of Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's message, with soaring vistas of skyscrapers and bridges, steel drills piercing thick slabs and pensive workers in hard hats, all in super-slow motion. A soothing, deep-voiced narrator asserts that skilled factory workers and tradespeople have seen their jobs shipped overseas, but that ''we can turn it around.''\par \par \uc2 The steel motif gives a story to the ad's optimistic message: American steel once provided the skeleton for the Empire State Building, it says, and now it can be used to rebuild the country. Or as the narrator says, parroting Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 : ''We're going to make America great again for everyone.''\par \par \uc2 THE TAKEAWAY Despite resembling a commercial for a steel industry trade association, the ad offers a positive rebuttal to the many negative ads raining down on Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 . It takes a while to get to that point; the narrator never mentions the candidate, and only a blue-and-white ''\uc2 Trump\uc2 : Make America Great Again!'' logo makes explicit whom the ad is supporting. But while the ad is consistent with Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's central message, its hopeful tone could be more palatable to voters put off by Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's slashing style and dire warnings.\par \par \uc2 Changing channels ...\par \par \uc2 Counterprogramming\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  enjoyed nearly wall-to-wall coverage throughout the convention. To break through, Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's campaign got creative: It released a new television ad, three new digital ads -- including a reissue of the famous ''Confessions of a Republican'' ad used in the 1964 \uc2 election\uc2 , and, perhaps most successfully, a ''\uc2 Trump\uc2  Yourself'' web application that scrapes a user's \uc2 Facebook\uc2  page to create personal \uc2 Trump\uc2  insults. The app downloads users' public Facebook profiles and email addresses.\par \par \uc2 What's Her Name Again?\par \par \uc2 Many labor unions and issue-oriented super PACs support Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , and now that the general \uc2 election\uc2  is officially underway, they are starting to advertise in support of her campaign. Yet some are oddly reluctant to say her name in their ads. NextGen California, a group led by \uc2 Tom Steyer\uc2 , the environmental activist, has run numerous ads criticizing Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  and encouraging people to vote against him, but not necessarily for Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 . And the \uc2 United Food and Commercial Workers union\uc2 , which has endorsed Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , ran a new ad on the final night of the Republican convention framing the choice for voters as ''\uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2 , or the better America we deserve?'' There was no mention of who should lead that ''better America.''\par \par \uc2 Reinforcements\par \par \uc2 Democrats were salivating at the chance of picking up a Senate seat in Florida before Senator \uc2 Marco Rubio\uc2  declared that he would seek re-\uc2 election\uc2  and his Democratic challenger, Representative Patrick Murphy, was the subject of a damaging report accusing him of inflating his r\u233\'00\'E9sum\u233\'00\'E9. A new ad for Mr. Murphy's campaign features a powerful testimonial: President Obama's. The president speaks through the entire ad, saying, ''Don't believe the negative attacks'' and highlighting the congressman's record, as Mr. Murphy is shown strolling on Florida beaches, through weeping willow trees and among swaying palms. ''I count on Patrick Murphy,'' Mr. Obama says. ''You can, too.''\par \par \uc2 Numbers\par \par \uc2 $57 MILLION: Amount spent so far on advertising in the Senate race in Pennsylvania, where the incumbent, Pat Toomey, a Republican, faces \uc2 Kathleen McGinty\uc2 , a Democrat, in the fall.\par \par \uc2 $41 MILLION: Amount spent on advertising in the Ohio Senate race, where Rob Portman, the incumbent Republican, is being challenged by former Gov. Ted Strickland.\par \par \uc2 Find out what you need to know about the 2016 presidential race today, and get politics news updates via \uc2 Facebook\uc2 , \uc2 Twitter\uc2  and the First Draft newsletter.\par \par \uc2 Document NYTF000020160724ec7o00048\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw272\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4080\pichgoal600

\par\par \b \uc2 Election\uc2  2016: California GOP Adopts 'Small-Ball' Tactic\b0\par\par\uc2 By John R. Emshwiller \par \uc2 1,011 \uc2 words\par \uc2 23 July 2016\par \uc2 The Wall Street Journal\par \uc2 J\par A6\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 LOS ANGELES -- California's Republican Party is working on a strategy to turn the state redder from the bottom up.\par \par \uc2 Leaders of a state party that once produced such national figures as the late Chief Justice Earl Warren and presidents Nixon and Reagan, but hasn't elected anyone to a statewide office in a decade, are focusing on down-ballot positions like the Romoland school board.\par \par \uc2 By winning local races -- such as for mayor, county supervisor and school board -- Republican officials hope to affect public policy as the party moves to build a bench of candidates who it hopes will eventually become viable in statewide races.\par \par \uc2 The "small-ball" strategy is helping the GOP, which won't have a candidate on the November ballot for the \uc2 U.S. Senate\uc2  seat of retiring Democrat Barbara Boxer, gain traction in local arenas and wield influence on such major issues facing the state as charter schools, the environment and business regulation, say party leaders.\par \par \uc2 There was a time, back in the 1990s, when California Republicans had at least an even chance of winning the governorship or a \uc2 U.S. Senate\uc2  seat, but "those days are gone," said state GOP chairman Jim Brulte. "That's why we have to focus on rebuilding from the bottom up."\par \par \uc2 Liberal political leanings on many issues by California voters and changing demographics, including a big increase in the Hispanic population, a key Democratic voting bloc, have hurt the Republican Party's position. A Republican-led effort in the 1990s to deny government services to illegal immigrants did long-term damage to the GOP brand among Hispanics, many observers have said.\par \par \uc2 Republicans don't have a contender in the November race for Sen. Boxer's seat because under California primary rules the top two vote-getters, regardless of party affiliation, move ahead. Two Democrats, state Attorney General Kamala Harris and U.S. Rep. Loretta Sanchez, won those spots.\par \par \uc2 But the GOP pulled off something of a coup this year at the South Coast Air Quality Management District, a major pollution-control agency in Southern California. It managed to tip the balance of the 13-member AQMD board to include seven Republicans. The body is generally viewed as nonpartisan; its members are picked by city, county and state officials.\par \par \uc2 In March, the seven Republicans voted to oust the district's executive officer, a longtime professional staffer, in what observers interpreted to be part of an effort to make the agency more business friendly.\par \par \uc2 An AQMD spokesman said the agency's board and staff "remain committed to achieving federally mandated, health-based clean air standards."\par \par \uc2 As of the beginning of this year, Republicans held about 43% of the elected positions in California cities and about 48% in counties, according to research by GrassrootsLab LLC, a Sacramento-based political-research firm whose clients include the state Republican Party.\par \par \uc2 Democrats held 43% and 41%, respectively, with the remainder held by independents and others.\par \par \uc2 Republican percentages are down about 2 percentage points from 2014, the furthest back the firm's research goes.\par \par \uc2 Besides not holding any statewide offices, the Republicans occupy just over a third of the 120 seats in the California legislature, where candidates carry party labels.\par \par \uc2 Population trends have been part of the problem for a party that has historically has drawn heavily from white voters. In the late 1980s, whites were nearly 60% of California's population compared with less than 40% currently, according to staterecords.\par \par \uc2 During that period, Republican registration fell to 27% from 38%. Currently, 45% of registered voters are Democrats while 23% express no party preference, according to the California Secretary of State.\par \par \uc2 "The demographic trends are killing us," said Mr. Brulte, who is trying with some success to field more nonwhite Republican candidates. For example, the Republicans have fielded candidates who are Latino and Asian-American.\par \par \uc2 Polls suggest the national Republican Party is out of sync with many California voters on issues from immigration to abortion rights. The proposal to build a wall across the Mexican border to keep out illegal immigrants -- a centerpiece of the campaign of Republican presidential nominee \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  -- is opposed by 71% of Californians, according to a poll released in May by the \uc2 Public Policy Institute of California\uc2  , a nonprofit research organization.\par \par \uc2 Republican candidates in California "have to deal with the scarlet-letter problem" of running with an "R" next to their name on the ballot, says John Pitney, Jr.,a professor of politics at Claremont McKenna College in Claremont, Calif.\par \par \uc2 Local races in California are nonpartisan, so candidates don't list a party affiliation even if they have one. In that label-free terrain -- where local issues such as schools and public services are important -- candidates who are Republicans find friendlier turf.\par \par \uc2 After winning another seat in the June primary, four of the five members of the school board in Romoland, a small district in Southern \uc2 California's Riverside County\uc2  , now are registered Republicans.\par \par \uc2 Five years ago, the board lineup consisted of two Republicans, two Democrats and an independent, said Scott Mann, the GOP county chairman.\par \par \uc2 Such victories could help on issues like opening more charter schools, said Scott Mann, the GOP county chairman. "We are in a stronger position," he said.\par \par \uc2 Democrats have taken notice of the GOP's local push, and say they aren't conceding territory. A state Democratic Party spokesman says his side is pushing to increase registration in Republican-leaning rural counties.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Brulte acknowledged his party has to pick its fights carefully even on the local level, given the Democrats' dominance in California. "Whenever they decide to go to war we are cognizant of what they can bring to the table," he said.\par \par \uc2 Despite its statewide problems, the GOP does have at least one thing going for it in the 2018 gubernatorial race, said Mr. Brulte. The "Democrats will not be nominating someone who is an institution in California politics like Jerry Brown," the incumbent who is blocked by term limits from running again.\par \par \uc2 Document J000000020160723ec7n0002k\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw272\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4080\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 LOUISIANA\par \par \uc2 David Duke to Run\par \par \uc2 For Senate Seat\par \par \uc2 Former Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke said Friday he would run as a Republican for an open Senate seat in Louisiana, saying he believed in the rights of all Americans but would "demand respect for the rights and the heritage of European Americans."\par \par \uc2 The Senate Republicans' campaign arm immediately rejected Mr. Duke, with the group's executive director, Ward Baker, saying on social media that the Republican Party had great candidates for the seat being vacated by Sen. David Vitter (R., La.) but that Mr. Duke "is not one of them."\par \par \uc2 Still, Mr. Duke's entry into a crowded race could stir up new problems for the GOP, for whom Mr. Duke has been a headache in recent years. As recently as this year, \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  drew criticism from Republican leaders after an interview in which he appeared to bypass an opportunity to disavow the support of Mr. Duke. Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  subsequently said he disavowed the backing of Mr. Duke.\par \par \uc2 "I believe in equal rights for all and respect for all Americans," Mr. Duke said in announcing his candidacy. "What makes me different is I also demand respect for the rights and the heritage of European Americans."\par \par \uc2 Mr. Duke made his candidacy official on the day of the deadline for filing to compete in the race. Two House GOP lawmakers from Louisiana, Reps. Charles Boustany and John Fleming, are already contending for the seat.\par \par \uc2 -- Siobhan Hughes\par \par \uc2 ---\par \par \uc2 DEMOCRATIC CONVENTION\par \par \uc2 Philadelphia Extends\par \par \uc2 Last Call Until 4 a.m.\par \par \uc2 If there are bleary-eyed delegates at next week's Democratic National Convention, consider this: last call will be later than usual in the host city.\par \par \uc2 Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Wolf signed legislation to temporarily allow Philadelphia bars and restaurants hosting DNC-related events to serve alcohol past 2 a.m., the decades-old cutoff under state law. Mr. Wolf, a Democrat, is an honorary chairman of the DNC host committee.\par \par \uc2 The new law didn't specify a later closing time. However, the DNC host committee, which is vetting applications from bars for permits to stay open late, decided that alcohol would be served no later than 4 a.m., a committee spokeswoman said.\par \par \uc2 The move was enabled by broader state budget legislation that received bipartisan support from members of the Pennsylvania legislature, which is controlled by Republicans. The state enacted a similar provision when Philadelphia hosted the Republican National Convention in 2000.\par \par \uc2 -- Peter Loftus\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=wjco20160723000098"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document J000000020160723ec7n0002m\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw272\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4080\pichgoal600

\par\par \b \uc2 Trump\uc2  Celebrates, But Feud Simmers\b0\par\par\uc2 By Janet Hook and Heather Haddon   \par \uc2 1,065 \uc2 words\par \uc2 23 July 2016\par \uc2 The Wall Street Journal\par \uc2 J\par A1\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 CLEVELAND -- A satisfied \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  celebrated "one of the most love-filled conventions in the history of conventions" on Friday, and then he capped the week of his Republican presidential nomination by reopening one of the week's most contentious moments: his feud with primary rival Sen. Ted Cruz.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  lashed out at Mr. Cruz for failing to endorse him after being granted a prime speaking slot at the convention this week. "I don't want his endorsement," Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  said. "If he gives it, I won't accept."\par \par \uc2 With emphasis on immigration, crime and "America first" policies in trade and foreign policy, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's acceptance speech and overall convention program echoed the signature messages that have brought people to his campaign. Quick survey and poll results brought positive news for Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 An instant CNN/ORC poll found that 56% of those viewing the speech said they would be more likely to vote for Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , 10% said it made them less likely to vote for him, and 32% said it had little effect.\par \par \uc2 In a Reuters/Ipsos poll taken over the course of the Republican convention, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  pulled closer to Democrat \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 . The July 18-22 national online poll found that 41% of likely voters supported Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , while 38% supported Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , with a margin of error of about 4 percentage points. On Monday, he trailed her by nearly 10 percentage points in the poll.\par \par \uc2 Traditionally, parties and their presidential nominees take their national conventions as an opportunity to turn from the primary-season focus on their own party to an effort to address a broader audience of independents and swing voters who will be needed to win a general \uc2 election\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 There were some efforts to do that at the GOP gathering by nodding to groups that haven't been Republican regulars: Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's acceptance speech called for protecting the gay, lesbian and transgender community from intolerance and terrorism, and he commented that he was glad to hear the GOP audience applaud his remarks. Technology executive \uc2 Peter Thiel\uc2  took the podium and noted he was the first openly gay Republican to speak to a GOP convention.\par \par \uc2 The speech beforehand by Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's daughter Ivanka was designed mainly to address women and counter accusations that her father demeans them. And she introduced herself as a millennial who, like about half of her generation, doesn't identify solely with either party.\par \par \uc2 Initial reactions suggested Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  made little progress with gay community leaders. The \uc2 Human Rights Campaign\uc2  said that "\uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  appallingly feigned support for LGBTQ people after opposing equality at every turn."\par \par \uc2 Far more of the convention's program, and most of Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's speech, appeared designed to shore up his base. That may have been a strategy born of necessity, in light of divisions within the party.\par \par \uc2 "It wasn't a speech that was uplifting, but \uc2 Trump\uc2 's never been about that," said Doug Heye, a former aide to House GOP leaders who has said he wouldn't vote for Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 . "It was a speech still aimed at the base -- not at trying to build a broader coalition of voters, but again that's not something \uc2 Trump\uc2  has ever tried to do."\par \par \uc2 Trump\uc2  supporters argue that he doesn't need a new message tailored to attracting new voters. "The key to appealing to the potential new voters to put you over the top is not to be more milquetoast and more moderate," said Sen. Jeff Sessions of Alabama, an early \uc2 Trump\uc2  backer. "So what he did was show strength: 'I understand you, I'm on your side.' And I think that message will resonate until November. It's going to get stronger, and I'm pretty confident that his vote total will grow."\par \par \uc2 Even some who aren't sold on Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  said the approach was smart. "\uc2 Trump\uc2  has cleverly positioned himself as the candidate of change, versus \uc2 Clinton\uc2  as the puppet of the status quo,"" said Scott Reed, political adviser to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce who has been skeptical of Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 . "Watch for a healthy bump in the battleground-state polls."\par \par \uc2 Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , speaking in Florida on Friday, strongly objected to the theme of Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's speech that he would speak for working people and the downtrodden. "Last night, Donald told us 'I am your voice,'" said Mrs, \uc2 Clinton\uc2 . "Well, I don't think he speaks for most Americans, do you? . . . Contrary to what they tried to say at their convention, I don't think he speaks for women."\par \par \uc2 Analysts from both parties will be watching closely to see how much and how lasting a bump in the polls Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  might get -- and whether it moves swing voters.\par \par \uc2 John Della Volpe, director of polling at the Harvard Institute of Politics who conducted a town hall meeting with young people in Cleveland during the convention, said that \uc2 Ivanka \uc2 Trump\uc2  was very appealing to young voters, but that her message of inclusion was overshadowed by her father's speech.\par \par \uc2 "Some of the good will created by her speech might have been lost, or at least not extended," by the nominee's acceptance speech that followed, Mr. Della Volpe said.\par \par \uc2 Some Republicans saw the greatest risk in the paucity of outreach to Hispanics, a fast-growing part of the electorate that GOP leaders want to court to bolster the party's future, but who have been particularly negative about Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  because of his anti-immigrant message.\par \par \uc2 "As a Hispanic, I didn't like what I heard," said Al Cardenas, former president of the American Conservative Union, who had supported \uc2 Trump\uc2  rival Jeb Bush. "If you were expecting him to pivot and cast a wider net going into the general \uc2 election\uc2 , you were wrong. I don't see how he gets enough people to follow him on such a narrow path."\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's morning-after attack on Mr. Cruz also renewed one of the most bizarre issues of the primary campaign, returning to allegations made in the National Enquirer tabloid that Mr. Cruz's father, Rafael Cruz, was linked to the assassination of President John F. Kennedy in 1963.\par \par \uc2 ---\par \par \uc2 Beth Reinhard, Reid J.

\par\par \uc2 THE STONE\par \uc2 OpEd; SECT\par \b \uc2 Trump\uc2 's Perilous 'Nation'\b0\par\par\uc2 By FEISAL G. MOHAMED \par \uc2 1,582 \uc2 words\par \uc2 23 July 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 The New York Times on the Web\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 One of the messages most often delivered at the 2016 Republican National Convention was that of unity. Not party unity, which clearly does not exist, but national unity, a goal to be achieved by setting aside the divisiveness of politics as usual. Never mind that the chant most often heard from the floor was ''build that wall,'' a hysterical fantasy of division, of casting out the undocumented workers who are, by any reasonable measure, integral to American society.\par \par \uc2 It is easy, and maybe accurate, to dismiss this as the kind of self-contradiction and doublespeak that is the Republicans' stock-in-trade, but it is also more than that.\par \par \uc2 Listening to \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's acceptance speech, I felt as though the \uc2 election\uc2  was turning into a battle between two very different, though equally formidable, 20th-century political philosophers, Carl Schmitt and Hannah Arendt. ''The specific political distinction to which political actions and motives can be reduced,'' Schmitt wrote in his 1927 work, ''The Concept of the Political,'' ''is that between friend and enemy.'' It is a statement meant to be descriptive, rather than prescriptive: The friend-enemy distinction is central to politics in the same way that a good-evil distinction is central to ethics and a beautiful-ugly distinction is central to aesthetics. All other considerations are peripheral to this core concern.\par \par \uc2 The considerations that Schmitt especially wishes to strip away are the legal and procedural ones central to defenses of the liberal state. Such defenses ignore the question of the political at their own peril, by reducing public life to a constant competition among interest groups and political factions with no overarching sense of purpose.\par \par \uc2 In many ways this has been the message of the \uc2 Trump\uc2  campaign all along, crystallized in his convention speech. At several points, he emphasized that his republic will be a polity of caring. But he also strained mightily to identify the groups posing an obstacle to this goal: undocumented workers and Islamic terrorists. Responsibility for a supposed rising tide of crime was placed squarely at the doorstep of Mexican migrants and Islamic State sympathizers. The presence of these groups in our midst is, in this view, preventing true political community from emerging.\par \par \uc2 This identification of enemies was entirely in keeping with \uc2 Trump\uc2 's rhetoric, but in presenting the case so starkly he freed himself to identify friends in ways that were somewhat surprising given the setting. Despite the open hostility to the \uc2 Black Lives Matter movement\uc2  apparent at the convention throughout the week, African-Americans received mention from \uc2 Trump\uc2  as victims of globalization suffering from joblessness and urban decay. This move collapsed the racial division between poor whites and poor blacks that Republicans so often exploit, replacing it with a focus on the plight of all workers who are Americans.\par \par \uc2 Even more surprising were the huge cheers in response to \uc2 Trump\uc2 's vow to defend the L.G.B.T.Q. community from Islamic extremists -- a turn of events that seemed to surprise the speaker himself, who paused to compliment the crowd on its decision momentarily to set aside one of the party's pet bigotries. This alchemical change was of course effected in the crucible of Orlando, Fla. Here we see how blood sacrifice at the hands of an enemy can alter the terms of political friendship, allowing a previously marginalized group a path to the center of political life. It is a core insight of one of Schmitt's finest current readers, Paul W. Kahn, in his books ''Sacred Violence'' and ''Political Theology,'' that American politics often works in this way, as when African-American sacrifice during World War II was mobilized to broaden anti-segregationist consensus.\par \par \uc2 Such is the kind of unity that \uc2 Trump\uc2  has sought to forge. By heaping hatred on foreign elements within America's borders, he seeks to thicken the meaning of the nation as a category. In a way resembling Schmitt's thought on sovereignty, he imagines the nation as an organic entity whose will is expressed through him. Or, put differently, he seeks to restore the racial and familial implications always at play in its Latin root, nationem, from nascor, to be born. In this way it is entirely fitting \uc2 Trump\uc2  was introduced by his daughter Ivanka, and that the week featured his children much more prominently than it did the usual party functionaries. We are being invited to join them under the beneficent wing of his paternal care.\par \par \uc2 Not all of us will accept the invitation. And in this respect we will share the skepticism of Hannah Arendt, whose core insight in her indispensable book ''The Origins of Totalitarianism'' is that the path to totalitarianism is cleared when the nation-state hyphen is severed, when the nation becomes an exclusive group that must defend itself through actions residing outside of the law and beyond the protections afforded by state institutions and procedures. Once the logic of a threatened national genus is accepted, emergency action grossly expanding the brutal exercise of state power is not far behind.\par \par \uc2 In this light, the Arendtian in the presidential race of 2016 would appear to be \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 . One obvious sign of this is \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's pledge to admit many more refugees from the Syrian conflict into the United States. In the most famous chapter of ''The Origins,'' Arendt harshly criticizes all those European and North American powers who had refused entrance to refugees during World War II, even characterizing them as participants in the Nazi program of imposing statelessness on European Jewry. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  has signaled that she will not repeat this mistake.\par \par \uc2 Clinton\uc2  is also clearly much more statist than \uc2 Trump\uc2 , and in fact it is difficult to discern in her rhetoric a sense of nationhood standing apart from state institutions and policies -- this is a major source of her emotional deficit as a politician. Hers is a politics of the achievable, of incremental progress within received institutional bounds, trained by the kind of long experience that breeds familiarity with the workings of government.\par \par \uc2 But statism is not an end in itself for Arendt, and we can certainly imagine her having misgivings about \uc2 Clinton\uc2 . In a curious moment of agreement with Schmitt, Arendt cites him in ''The Origins,'' in describing the state's rising domination and possession of the category of nationhood in the 18th and 19th centuries leads wealthy and powerful elites to claim that they are rising above party faction only when it suits their interests. In an even curiouser moment of agreement, when Schmitt later articulates his thought on this development in the context of the 1848 uprisings that erupted across Europe, he relies on Karl Marx's analysis in ''The Eighteenth Brumaire of Napoleon Bonaparte.''\par \par \uc2 Uniting these three very different political philosophers, Arendt, Schmitt and Marx, is an insight on the ways in which pure statism inherently favors moneyed interests. Without some sort of pressure from the sphere of political action, the levers of the state fall all too readily into the hands of the wealthy and well connected. For Arendt this leads to a politics where Enlightenment principles like justice and equality are hollowed of significance and used only to advance the agenda of the powerful.\par \par \uc2 So when several commentators on the right and left accuse \uc2 Clinton\uc2  of being beholden to banks and corporations, we can imagine Arendt paying close attention. As is clear from ''The Human Condition,'' the portions of the liberal tradition that mattered to Arendt emphasize a political space for the kind of human creativity that has positive civic effect. This she likens to the human capacity for procreation: Just as we have the power to bring new human beings into the world, so also we have the power to bring new ideas into the world that reshape their environment, having ripple effects of responses that are also new. This is our highest calling, and highest achievement, as social and political beings. If Arendt is a liberal, she is a liberal with a significant civic republican streak.\par \par \uc2 Schmitt is widely, and justly, despised as a person and thinker for having joined the Nazi party in 1933 and refusing to submit to denazification after the war. But his insights on the way politics works still prove to be remarkably, if also lamentably, useful. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , like Schmitt, sees the government of his time as having failed, and seeks to heighten our sense of political emergency.\par \par \uc2 On the other side is \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , who with Arendtian poise casts cold water on a tribalist politics -- she has admirably not responded in kind, even if she has frequently indulged in a politics of fear by playing up the monstrosity of her opponent. But if we truly cast our lot with Arendt's political philosophy, as so many of us do either knowingly or unknowingly, we might find that both candidates leave us wanting.\par \par \uc2 Now in print: ''The Stone Reader: Modern Philosophy in 133 Arguments,'' an anthology of essays from The Times's philosophy series, edited by Peter Catapano and Simon Critchley, published by Liveright Books.\par \par \uc2 Follow The \uc2 New York Times\uc2  Opinion section on \uc2 Facebook\uc2  and \uc2 Twitter\uc2 , and sign up for the Opinion Today newsletter.\par \par \uc2 Feisal G.

\par\par \uc2 NEWS ANALYSIS\par \uc2 Politics; SECT\par \b \uc2 In Speech, \uc2 Trump\uc2  Envisions an America That Is Not a Nation of Nations\b0\par\par\uc2 By JULIA PRESTON; Mark Landler contributed reporting. \par \uc2 853 \uc2 words\par \uc2 23 July 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 The New York Times on the Web\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 With all the political orthodoxy that \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2  tore up in his convention speech on Thursday night, he set aside a core tenet of the American narrative on immigration: that the United States is a nation of nations, built on the sweat and initiative of people who came from other countries.\par \par \uc2 Using even darker language than he had on the campaign trail, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  did not include even a boilerplate mention of positive contributions by immigrants. He described foreigners who came to the United States illegally and became killers of American citizens and drug dealers. More forcefully than he had before, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  said he would also impose new restrictions on legal immigration to protect American workers from lower-paid competition in the labor market.\par \par \uc2 Under his presidency, the American dream would be primarily reserved for Americans.\par \par \uc2 ''The American people will come first once again,'' he said.\par \par \uc2 Historians and legal scholars struggled to recall when a presidential candidate had departed so radically from the traditional view that America's welcome for immigrants was a prime reason for its exceptional innovation and prosperity. Not since the restrictionist movements in the early 20th century has a leading politician tried to galvanize Americans with such an unalloyed nativist message.\par \par \uc2 ''This was completely one-sided in its projection of what immigration means to the nation: It's all bad,'' said Peter J. Spiro, a professor of immigration law at Temple University.\par \par \uc2 In long passages, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  made it clear that border security and immigration control were central pieces of a strategy to keep Americans safe from the rest of the world. He dwelled on the murders of Kate Steinle and Sarah Root, Americans who were killed by illegal border crossers with criminal records.\par \par \uc2 ''These wounded American families have been alone,'' he said. ''But they are alone no longer.'' There was no contrasting evocation of immigrant entrepreneurs or inventors or farmworkers.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's tough immigration stances could pose a risk in the general \uc2 election\uc2 . A Gallup poll released this week found that two-thirds of Americans opposed deporting immigrants who came here illegally, and that a similar amount opposed building a border wall, as Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  had proposed.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's indictment of the Obama administration's policies was based on selected facts and dark hyperbole. He spoke of ''massive refugee flows'' of Syrians, saying there was ''no way to screen those refugees.'' Anyone ''who endorses violence, hatred or oppression is not welcome in our country and never will be,'' he said.\par \par \uc2 Under the current system, refugees coming from abroad, especially from Syria, go through multiple layers of vetting that can take as long as two years. Anyone who espouses violence is excluded. The Obama administration has said that it would accept 10,000 Syrians this year, a big increase because previous numbers were low.\par \par \uc2 ''Since Sept. 11 we have created a thorough and careful system,'' said \uc2 David Martin\uc2 , an emeritus law professor at the University of Virginia.\par \par \uc2 Painting images of a wide-open border, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  said that the increase in those who crossed it illegally this year already exceeded the numbers from 2015, and that tens of thousands had been released ''with no regard for the impact on public safety or resources.''\par \par \uc2 Most of the immigrants are unaccompanied children and parents with children, largely from violence-torn countries in Central America, who are released to pursue asylum claims in immigration courts. The numbers have increased sharply this year after declining in 2015 but have not reached the levels of 2014.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's remarks drew a strong rebuke on Friday from President \uc2 Obama\uc2 , who rejected the notion that the nation was being inundated with immigrants coming illegally.\par \par \uc2 ''We have far fewer undocumented workers crossing the border than we did in the '80s, the '90s, or when George Bush was president,'' \uc2 Mr. Obama\uc2  said during a White House news conference with the president of Mexico, Enrique Pe\u241\'00\'F1a Nieto. ''That is fact.''\par \par \uc2 Immigrant advocates, long opposed to Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's proposals, were still taken aback by his ominous tone.\par \par \uc2 ''Our national identity is anchored in the notion that we are a permanently evolving people, where the other becomes us and we are strengthened by it,'' said Frank Sharry, executive director of America's Voice, a pro-immigration group. ''\uc2 Trump\uc2  is taking dead aim at that idea. Immigrants are the other, he says, and the 'us' is a fearful group of white people.''\par \par \uc2 But some Latinos noted that Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  had not repeated his plan to deport all 11 million immigrants living in the country illegally.\par \par \uc2 ''I didn't love the rhetoric,'' said Alfonso Aguilar, executive director of the American Principles Project's Latino Partnership, a conservative group. He has endorsed Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 . ''He is the only choice we have right now, considering the threats the nation is facing.''\par \par \uc2 Find out what you need to know about the 2016 presidential race today, and get politics news updates via \uc2 Facebook\uc2 , \uc2 Twitter\uc2  and the First Draft newsletter.\par \par \uc2 Document NYTF000020160723ec7n0005x\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 CRITIC'S NOTEBOOK\par \uc2 The Arts/Cultural Desk; SECT\par \b \uc2 A \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  Speech Whose Sunny Spots Came Mostly From the Stage Lights\b0\par\par\uc2 By JAMES PONIEWOZIK \par \uc2 1,157 \uc2 words\par \uc2 23 July 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 The New York Times on the Web\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 My fellow Americans, the state of the union is dark and full of terrors.\par \par \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2  took the stage Thursday night at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland and said, ''I humbly and gratefully accept your nomination.'' This being Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , ''humbly'' meant arriving amid fanfare to a gold-trimmed lectern in front of a video screen emblazoned with ''\uc2 TRUMP\uc2 '' on a gold background, on a stage washed in gold light.\par \par \uc2 But all that glitters is not sunny. Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  gave a grim, angry acceptance speech to close a grim, angry convention, casting America as a dystopian hellscape and himself as the only leader capable of saving it from murder, terrorism, financial ruin and an uncontrolled wave of immigrants.\par \par \uc2 A big question before the convention was whether Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  would ''pivot'' for the general \uc2 election\uc2  in tone, in style, in substance. The answers ranged from ''no'' to ''sort of.''\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's speech was typically yuge -- lasting around an hour and 15 minutes -- and it doubled down on his themes from the primaries, including immigration and trade, but with a bolstered emphasis on ''law and order,'' a Nixon-in-1968 phrase that he used repeatedly and emphatically.\par \par \uc2 But audiences used to seeing Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  ad-lib on the campaign trail -- riffing on protesters, ranting at mosquitoes -- saw a much more on-message candidate, sticking tightly to his script.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's delivery seemed to aim for a hybrid, combining discipline with little flashes of the improvisatory campaigner who wowed his faithful in the Republican primaries.\par \par \uc2 He peppered his speech with his characteristic gestures: the thumb-finger circle, the hand chop. He allowed himself little riffs: ''We're gonna fix that!'' ''Not going to happen!'' ''And by the way, Melania and Ivanka -- did they do a job?'' At times, it was as if you could see his digressive impulses straining under his shirt collar.\par \par \uc2 What the speech lacked in unpredictability, it made up for in volume and direness. Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  near-shouted much of what he had to say, and what he had to say was frightening. According to Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , Americans were in peril of life and livelihood, and his opponent was largely to blame. ''This is the legacy of \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 ,'' he charged: ''death, destruction, terrorism and weakness.''\par \par \uc2 Even at his most outrageous during the primaries, there was often a playfulness to Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's bantering stump style. But this was Dark Donald, presenting himself as a man for hard times.\par \par \uc2 There were promises of better days -- he would make the country rich, save the streets, build the wall -- but it was not an upbeat, win-win sort of optimism. It was the optimism that, very soon, you would beat someone instead of them beating you. ''We love defeating those people, don't we?'' he said, in an aside about his campaign's naysayers.\par \par \uc2 The crowd did love it. They engaged with the speech, in one instance to the point of discomfort. When they erupted into ''Lock her up! Lock her up!'' -- the chant, popular all four nights, demanding that Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  be jailed -- Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  shook his head and waved his hands in a quashing motion. ''Let's defeat her in November,'' he said.\par \par \uc2 It was a rare case of Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  trying to rein in the fury that his campaign had used as rocket fuel. (On \uc2 CNN\uc2 , John King said that Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's team had planned for just this situation in speech preparation.)\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  was introduced by his daughter Ivanka, who spoke of him as much as a boss as a father. She described him as a beneficent employer for women. She was poised and positive, and focused on issues like making child care accessible and improving working conditions. It was a good-cop-bad-cop routine, with the good cop coming out first.\par \par \uc2 But if Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's speech was not the shining-city-on-a-hill sort, it fit the tone of the program that built to it. This was an angry convention. All week, the crowd in the hall sounded most engaged and excited when it was yelling at or about someone.\par \par \uc2 On Tuesday night, \uc2 Gov. Chris Christie\uc2  of New Jersey gave a community-theater performance of ''The Crucible,'' inciting the crowd to roar ''Guilty!'' through a mock trial of Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 . ''Lock her up!'' became the new ''Drill, baby, drill.'' (Off the floor, it got even uglier, when a New Hampshire state representative said that Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  should be ''shot for treason.'')\par \par \uc2 The most puzzling outburst came on Wednesday, when the campaign allowed Senator Ted Cruz of Texas to speak, knowing that he would -- pointedly -- not endorse Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 . It played like a pro-wrestling spectacle: Mr. Cruz's preening heel turn, the hooting crowd, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's surprise appearance just as the boos crescendoed. (I half-expected a ringside announcer to cry, ''Good God, that's \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2 's music!'')\par \par \uc2 Each night had a nominal theme -- ''Make America Safe Again,'' ''Make America First Again'' -- but there wasn't much cohesion among the speeches except for laying into Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 . And between the distracting plagiarism controversy surrounding his wife's speech on Monday night and the intraparty fighting, any narrative thread leading up to Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's speech was lost.\par \par \uc2 But maybe ''narrative'' is the wrong framework for Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's convention. It was more like a summer action-movie trailer. We got a series of holy-smoke moments and eardrum-popping explosions, whipping up emotions and building a sense of chaos and agitation until Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's closing speech settled on us like the title logo of a big-budget feature: ''\uc2 TRUMP\uc2 : COMING NOVEMBER 2016.''\par \par \uc2 Well, trailers do sell movies. And it's possible that this chaotic approach hooks the audience on some primal level beyond the pundits' text analysis.\par \par \uc2 And all the sideshows, intentional or not, left the news media scrambling to keep up, buzzing from flare-up to flare-up in a week in which Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  also told The \uc2 New York Times\uc2  that he might decide not to defend some \uc2 NATO\uc2  allies.\par \par \uc2 After his wife's speech controversy, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  -- never one to let even a negative story die -- wrote on \uc2 Twitter\uc2 : ''Good news is Melania's speech got more publicity than any in the history of politics especially if you believe that all press is good press!''\par \par \uc2 No human being has ever appeared to believe that more fervently than Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 . At the 1988 Republican convention, the elder George Bush gave us a thousand points of light. Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  gave us a thousand shiny objects.\par \par \uc2 And in his crowning speech, he gave us something else: a bet that this fall, he can win with a scared and disillusioned electorate -- what he called in his speech ''the forgotten'' -- by lighting a beacon of darkness.\par \par \uc2 Document NYTF000020160723ec7n0005y\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 CONTRIBUTING OP-ED WRITER\par \uc2 OpEd; SECT\par \b \uc2 What Does Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  Mean to You?\b0\par\par\uc2 By EMMA ROLLER \par \uc2 1,473 \uc2 words\par \uc2 23 July 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 The New York Times on the Web\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 CLEVELAND -- It was impossible to look around Cleveland and not see the word ''\uc2 Trump\uc2 '' plastered over everything in sight: on billboards, on signs, on hats, on T-shirts, on storefronts. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , \uc2 Trump\uc2 , \uc2 Trump\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 The police presence downtown made it feel as though this Midwestern city was ready for military action. But apart from a few scattered shouting matches, everyone was civil to one another.\par \par \uc2 Wednesday night in Public Square, the central plaza downtown, kids ran through fountains. On Thursday, on a bustling block near the convention site, a trio of girls calling themselves the USA Freedom Kids high-stepped in their American flag outfits while lip-syncing a jingoistic tune: ''Loud and proud in the land of the free, because of the brave.'' Down the street, a guitarist sang a country-blues song with the refrain, ''\uc2 Trump\uc2  Train is rollin' on down the line.''\par \par \uc2 Throughout the week, Cleveland residents came out to see the spectacle, and were joined by out-of-town \uc2 Trump\uc2  supporters, protesters, delegates, curiosity seekers.\par \par \uc2 So what did they think of Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 ? The main takeaway was that no one seems too happy with the options.\par \par \uc2 Marquita Jackson, 28\par \par \uc2 Cleveland\par \par \uc2 Marquita Jackson and her boyfriend, Joseph Meeks, had come to Public Square with their two young children. Like many couples I talked to, Ms. Jackson leaned toward Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  and Mr. Meeks leaned toward Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 . But neither of them seemed excited.\par \par \uc2 ''I just think people should stick to what they know,'' Ms. Jackson said of Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , adding that people don't need to be divided against each other.\par \par \uc2 Joseph Meeks III, 28\par \par \uc2 Cleveland\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  is ''a fighter to me,'' Joseph Meeks said, holding his 2-month-old son on his chest. ''I think \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  is going to stop all the recklessness.''\par \par \uc2 ''He came from being poor. He's a self-made man,'' he added. (This is not true.)\par \par \uc2 Roger Hill, 43\par \par \uc2 Oshkosh, Wis.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Hill, an incredibly friendly man whose entire face and head are covered in tattoos, said he got them years ago, because he wanted people to be afraid of him, because he hated himself. Now, he's a pastor, and he says the tattoos are a good icebreaker.\par \par \uc2 So, whom does he see himself voting for in November? ''It's tough,'' he said, but added that it seemed as if Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  is a ''good father'' and has ''more principles'' than \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 He asked if he could pray over me for my safety while covering the two conventions, and we hugged.\par \par \uc2 Diane Googins, 49\par \par \uc2 Columbus, Ohio\par \par \uc2 ''I don't know that he has all the answers. \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  opened a door to our nation's face,'' said Ms. Googins. ''It was already there. He just brought it to the surface.''\par \par \uc2 Jesse Gonzales, 26\par \par \uc2 Cleveland\par \par \uc2 Mr. Gonzales was carrying a rifle in Public Square, which is legal in Ohio, chatting with two friends when I found him. He said he wanted to show people that most gun owners are respectful, responsible people who just want to exercise their constitutional rights.\par \par \uc2 Asked what \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  represents to him, Mr. Gonzales said, ''America first'' -- specifically, more nationalistic immigration and trade policies.\par \par \uc2 ''The nation-state exists for a reason,'' he said, adding that this \uc2 election\uc2  ''represents a shift back toward strong individuals as opposed to bureaucrats who just play the game.''\par \par \uc2 Kaitlin Rhodes, 27\par \par \uc2 Cleveland\par \par \uc2 Ms. Rhodes was standing near the fountain in Public Square wearing a camouflage jacket with a ''Hillary for prison'' patch on the back. In 2012, Ms. Rhodes voted for Gary Johnson, the former New Mexico governor and Libertarian Party presidential nominee. She said she planned to vote for him again this year.\par \par \uc2 ''I honestly have no opinion about \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2 ,'' she said. Does \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  support small government? ''Nobody knows. I can't keep track of it, and that's why I can't have an opinion about him.''\par \par \uc2 ''I would like to like him,'' she added.\par \par \uc2 Aisha Samad, 62\par \par \uc2 Cleveland\par \par \uc2 Ms. Samad was in Public Square with other members of the \uc2 Council on American-Islamic Relations\uc2 , passing out literature and gum packaged to look like medicine called Islamophobin -- ''Multisymptom relief for chronic Islamophobia.''\par \par \uc2 ''I never thought it would get this far,'' Ms. Samad said about Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's nomination. ''We're in a worse place in America than I thought we were.''\par \par \uc2 She said she had been praying a lot about the \uc2 election\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 ''I don't know what else to do. It frightens me. I'm hoping and praying that a light bulb comes on in this country,'' she said. ''Hate never wins anything.''\par \par \uc2 Johnny Gooch, 60\par \par \uc2 Cleveland\par \par \uc2 Ms. Gooch and his friend Larry McLeod were outside Terminal Tower, across the street from Public Square. Mr. Gooch was there to make some money off of convention-goers by selling loose cigarettes. He said he didn't like what Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  had done to the country, and will probably vote for Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 ''I think he played a separation game with this country, and we don't need that. I see a lot of lies with him,'' he said.\par \par \uc2 ''The only difference between me and him is I don't lie,'' he said, ''most of the time.''\par \par \uc2 Larry McLeod, 60\par \par \uc2 Cleveland\par \par \uc2 Mr. McLeod said that he was in the Marine Corps from 1973 to 1986.\par \par \uc2 Saying foreign policy has been corrupted by corporate influence, Mr. McLeod said he was attracted by Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's promise to reduce American involvement overseas.\par \par \uc2 ''I swore to defend the Constitution of the United States, not the businesses that run it,'' he said.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  is ''not a bully -- he just says the things that we all say at the bar or sitting around the kitchen table,'' Mr. McLeod said. ''There's no rule in the Constitution saying you have to be politically correct to become president.''\par \par \uc2 Anne Raspey, 60\par \par \uc2 Cleveland\par \par \uc2 I found Ms. Raspey and her friend Bev Damico sitting under a tree in a park next to the Cuyahoga River, eating breakfast together. It was Ms. Raspey's day off from the \uc2 Cleveland Clinic\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 ''He scares me,'' she said of Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 . ''He doesn't have a filter. He speaks what's on his mind, but what's on his mind bothers me.''\par \par \uc2 Bev Damico, 61\par \par \uc2 Cleveland\par \par \uc2 Ms. Damico, an occupational therapist, said Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  wasn't her first choice for president, but she would most likely vote for him in November.\par \par \uc2 ''He definitely wasn't the one I was hoping would be there,'' she said.\par \par \uc2 Ms. Damico said her 22-year-old son recently asked her what the point of voting was this fall.\par \par \uc2 ''If you're apathetic, where does that get you?'' she said.\par \par \uc2 Steve Rowsey, 63\par \par \uc2 Cleveland\par \par \uc2 Mr. Rowsey was walking with a group of friends to see the spectacle the convention brought to his hometown. He voted for Senator Bernie Sanders in the Democratic primary because he doesn't think Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  is honest.\par \par \uc2 When asked what \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  meant to him, he said, ''Trouble.''\par \par \uc2 Jorge Villarreal, 19\par \par \uc2 Houston\par \par \uc2 Mr. Villarreal, an at-large alternate delegate from Texas, was wearing the Texas delegate uniform of cowboy boots, a cowboy hat and a shirt with the Texas state flag insignia.\par \par \uc2 He said he was ''definitely'' disappointed that Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  became the Republican nominee. He said he would vote for Mr. Johnson in the fall.\par \par \uc2 ''\uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  represents a part of the Republican Party that most Republicans are not proud of,'' he said.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Villarreal said he hadn't been a big fan of Senator Ted Cruz, either, because ''he tries to shove religion down people's throats.'' That changed when the Texas senator addressed his state's delegation on Thursday morning, explaining why he chose not to endorse Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  in his convention speech.\par \par \uc2 ''I think that was the best speech of his life,'' he said. ''My respect for him grew a whole bunch.''\par \par \uc2 John Martin, 62\par \par \uc2 London, Ohio\par \par \uc2 Mr. Martin voted for Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  in the Ohio primary, but said many of his Republican friends remain hesitant to throw their support behind their party's nominee.\par \par \uc2 ''He's something new, something different,'' Mr. Martin said of Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 . ''I'm tired of the insiders.''\par \par \uc2 He said Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's business experience meant he would be able to delegate responsibilities, even if he himself doesn't have all the answers.\par \par \uc2 ''Reagan wasn't a genius,'' Mr. Martin said, but ''he was a hell of a manager. The C.E.O. of the company doesn't know what kind of toilet paper to order.''\par \par \uc2 Follow The \uc2 New York Times\uc2  Opinion section on \uc2 Facebook\uc2  and \uc2 Twitter\uc2  (@NYTopinion), and sign up for the Opinion Today newsletter.\par \par \uc2 Emma Roller (@EmmaRoller), a former reporter for National Journal, is a contributing opinion writer.\par \par \uc2 Document NYTF000020160723ec7n0005a\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

It's Only Democratic.\b0\par\par\uc2 By DIANE RUSSELL \par \uc2 865 \uc2 words\par \uc2 23 July 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 The New York Times on the Web\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 PORTLAND, Me. -- In no recent American \uc2 election\uc2  has the divide between a powerful elite and a frustrated public been so apparent and so central as in 2016. How we address this issue will define the future of our country. For many Democrats, the living symbol of this divide are the superdelegates.\par \par \uc2 In my state, Maine, more than 64 percent of voters supported Bernie Sanders in the caucuses. Yet many of the superdelegates -- also known as unpledged party leader and elected official delegates -- were pledged to \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  long before rank-and-file Democrats even voted. As a state representative, I heard the frustration from my constituents. To address that, I sponsored an amendment to the rules of the Maine Democratic Party requiring that, starting in 2020, superdelegates vote in proportion to the popular vote.\par \par \uc2 The proposal also included a nonbinding resolution that our current superdelegates vote in proportion to this year's caucus votes. And a second nonbinding resolution directs Maine's \uc2 Democratic National Committee\uc2  members to work at the national level to abolish superdelegates.\par \par \uc2 Less than two months later, Democrats in nearly 20 states have voted -- most at their local conventions -- to reform the superdelegate system. National leaders like the retired congressman \uc2 Barney Frank\uc2 ; Christine Pelosi, a five-time former national committee member; her mother, the Democratic House leader, \uc2 Nancy Pelosi\uc2 ; former Senator Russ Feingold; former Labor Secretary Robert B. Reich; Senator Elizabeth Warren; and a host of progressive organizations have come out in opposition to the superdelegate system.\par \par \uc2 It's easy to understand why: The numbers are indefensible. When the \uc2 Pew Research Center\uc2  analyzed the demographics of the 2016 superdelegates, what they found was disturbing -- considering the Democratic Party's efforts to reach marginalized voices. According to the study, 58 percent of superdelegates are male, 62 percent are white and their average age is about 60.\par \par \uc2 In taking up the fight against the system, those of us who have been left behind by establishment politics -- or the Good Old Boys Club -- found a way to make the party of democracy more democratic. The Democratic Party should reflect the collective power of the people and welcome voters who share a common vision of equal opportunity. Operating like a private club is antithetical to those principles.\par \par \uc2 At our national convention in Philadelphia, Democrats have a historic opportunity to change this. As Democrats, we cannot in good conscience deny that there is among working-class and middle-class voters a growing frustration -- well beyond my state -- with the tone-deafness of some of our elected representatives. We have always been the party of the hard-working, the voiceless and the downtrodden, but by upholding the privileges of superdelegates, we are betraying the people we fight for.\par \par \uc2 This isn't just about ideals; it's about arithmetic. A recent Bloomberg Politics poll showed that just 55 percent of Sanders supporters planned to vote for Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 ; an alarming 22 percent said they planned to vote for Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , while 18 percent planned to take their chances with the Libertarian Party nominee, \uc2 Gary Johnson\uc2 . While Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  remains ahead of Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  in national polling, we've already seen the Republican nominee defy the odds -- and pollsters' predictions.\par \par \uc2 In my home state, split votes twice allowed the Republican Paul LePage to win \uc2 election\uc2  to governor. If we ignore the math and the populist anger, and alienate Sanders supporters, we could end up waking to a nasty \uc2 election\uc2  hangover on Nov. 9.\par \par \uc2 To build unity, Democrats must re-establish trust with the base of the party. Platform changes, if only symbolic, are a big part of that. Mr. Sanders helped devise the most progressive party platform in United States history, winning concessions that include support for a $15 minimum wage and an expansion of Social Security. What remains is to ensure that grass-roots Democrats people can express their voice in the party's nominating process for president.\par \par \uc2 That is why I recently submitted an amendment to the party's rules committee that would eliminate superdelegates. It would leave in place the current system of pledged delegates, who are elected in proportion to each state's popular vote. Party bigwigs can have a privileged place at the national convention, but they should not have privileged votes.\par \par \uc2 Getting rid of the superdelegate system will not mean the end of our efforts to make the party fully democratic, but it would lay a firm foundation on which to build a stronger, more progressive vision for our country. More important, rank-and-file Democrats will get back their voices -- and their confidence that their votes count.\par \par \uc2 The rules committee should send the proposal to the convention floor in Philadelphia and recommend that the convention delegates support it. To borrow the words of one of that city's favorite sons, Benjamin Franklin, we have a republic -- if we can keep it.\par \par \uc2 Follow The \uc2 New York Times\uc2  Opinion section on \uc2 Facebook\uc2  and \uc2 Twitter\uc2  (@NYTopinion), and sign up for the Opinion Today newsletter.\par \par \uc2 Diane Russell is a member of the Maine House of Representatives and a national delegate to the Democratic National Convention.\par \par \uc2 Document NYTF000020160723ec7n0005b\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 EDITORIAL\par \uc2 Editorial Desk; SECTA\par \b \uc2 The Swing-State Appeal of Mr. Kaine\b0\par\par\uc2 By THE EDITORIAL BOARD \par \uc2 430 \uc2 words\par \uc2 23 July 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 18\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's choice of Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia as her running mate is a safe and solid choice in an \uc2 election\uc2  that will almost certainly become nastier.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Kaine, former Virginia governor, lieutenant governor and Richmond mayor, is respected and steeped in the politics of Virginia, a bellwether Southern battleground whose economy is undergoing the type of trade- and technology-related shifts that are an important factor in this \uc2 election\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 As a staunch Catholic with blue-collar roots, who grew up in Kansas City, Mo., he is likely to give Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  a needed boost among white men and independent voters. His fluency in Spanish -- he was a missionary in Honduras -- should also help him reach out to Latinos.\par \par \uc2 Politically, Mr. Kaine, who sits on the Senate Foreign Relations and Armed Services Committees, is a moderate with a pro-trade bent. Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  was said to have been torn among several candidates for the job. Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts or Senator Sherrod Brown of Ohio were favored by Bernie Sanders's liberal supporters, but Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  has already tacked somewhat to the left and they might not have been seen as balancing the ticket.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Kaine delivers a potential advantage among moderate swing-state voters who might have been harder for Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  to attract.\par \par \uc2 His political success as a liberal Democrat -- with a perfect score from \uc2 Planned Parenthood\uc2  and an F rating from the \uc2 National Rifle Association\uc2  -- in a state with a deeply conservative tradition shows an ability to retain his principles while being pragmatic enough to work with Republicans.\par \par \uc2 ''He always finds reasons for hope and optimism in every situation, and he is centered by his faith and his family,'' Senator Mark Warner, who was governor of Virginia when Mr. Kaine was lieutenant governor, said in a statement.\par \par \uc2 A Morning Consult survey conducted earlier this month found that over all, 11 percent of all voters and 20 percent of Democrats said his name on the ticket would make them more likely to support Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 . On issues, he's very similar to Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 One knock on the wonky Mr. Kaine is that he is ''boring.'' Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  says that she loves that about him. As well she should. An experienced, no-surprises politician like Mr. Kaine provides Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  with important ballast for the stormy and unpredictable race ahead.\par \par \uc2 Follow The \uc2 New York Times\uc2  Opinion section on \uc2 Facebook\uc2  and \uc2 Twitter\uc2  (@NYTopinion), and sign up for the Opinion Today newsletter.\par \par \uc2 Document NYTF000020160723ec7n0005f\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 MAN IN THE NEWS\par \uc2 National Desk; SECTA\par \b \uc2 A Self-Effacing Senator in a Sharp-Elbows Era\b0\par\par\uc2 By SHERYL GAY STOLBERG; Kitty Bennett contributed research. \par \uc2 2,263 \uc2 words\par \uc2 23 July 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 1\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 WASHINGTON -- The day after \uc2 Barack Obama\uc2  became the first African-American to win the White House, Tim Kaine, then the governor of Virginia, visited a civil rights memorial in Richmond. There, in a former capital of the Confederacy, he summed up the history-making moment in four words.\par \par \uc2 ''Ol' Virginny is dead,'' an exhausted but happy Mr. Kaine declared.\par \par \uc2 It was a reference to a former official state song whose slavery-era lyrics -- ''this old darkey's heart'' who ''labored hard for old massa'' -- stood for a history that Mr. Kaine, a Midwest-born, Harvard-educated former civil rights lawyer, abhorred. But Mr. Obama's six-point victory in Virginia was also, in a way, a parallel of Mr. Kaine's own success there.\par \par \uc2 As mayor of Richmond, lieutenant governor, governor, chairman of the Democratic National Committee and now senator, Mr. Kaine has deftly managed his own rise as a progressive in a bastion of Southern conservatism.\par \par \uc2 Timothy Michael Kaine, \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's running mate, is widely described by people in his political orbit as a likable if less than charismatic figure -- ''I'm boring,'' he conceded on NBC's ''Meet the Press'' -- guided by moral convictions that flow from his deep Christian faith. In hyperpartisan Washington, he is often seen as a centrist. He has tangled with Mr. Obama on military and foreign policy, and irritates many progressives with his support for free trade.\par \par \uc2 But his calm, even temperament -- when angry, he is apt to say he is ''steamed'' -- leads to misguided assumptions about his core beliefs. At heart, Mr. Kaine is an old-fashioned liberal, dyed in the wool.\par \par \uc2 Driven by Jesuit ideals, he represented death row inmates and victims of housing discrimination in Richmond, winning a $100.5 million verdict in a redlining case against \uc2 Nationwide Insurance\uc2  (it was overturned on appeal, and his team negotiated a $17.5 million settlement). He was so touched by his clients that Rhonda Harmon, a lawyer who worked with him on the housing case, said she once found him poring over papers at his desk ''with tears in his eyes.''\par \par \uc2 He gets an F rating from the \uc2 National Rifle Association\uc2 , but a perfect score from \uc2 Planned Parenthood\uc2 , despite his personal opposition to abortion, which he says is a matter of his Roman Catholic faith.\par \par \uc2 As governor, Mr. Kaine may best be remembered for how he handled trying moments.\par \par \uc2 Despite his revulsion for capital punishment, he allowed 11 executions to proceed, telling voters he had an obligation to carry out Virginia law. And after the 2007 massacre of 32 people at Virginia Tech University by a deranged student -- until the massacre in Orlando, Fla., it was the deadliest rampage by a single gunman in American history -- he won admiration from both sides of the aisle for his compassion.\par \par \uc2 ''I don't want to say anything bad about him, because he's a very nice guy, but I don't want to say anything good about him because I'm a Republican,'' said Speaker William J. Howell of the Virginia House of Delegates.\par \par \uc2 ''The one thing I will say for him is, unlike some other governors we've had, he didn't seem to waver or waffle,'' Mr. Howell said. ''He never stuck his finger in the air to see which way the wind was blowing.''\par \par \uc2 As a politician, Mr. Kaine has been scandal-free. But under Virginia's liberal ethics laws at the time, he accepted more than $120,000 worth of gifts, including some from companies with business before the state, while he was lieutenant governor and governor.\par \par \uc2 The gifts were legal but national Republicans, irked by public corruption charges against Mr. Kaine's Republican successor, Bob McDonnell, for accepting gifts, have signaled they intend to use them to attack Mr. Kaine's character this fall.\par \par \uc2 Born in St. Paul, Mr. Kaine was raised in the Kansas City suburb of Overland Park, Kan., where his father owned a welding shop. He attended an all-boys Jesuit high school, and then the University of Missouri, with the intention of being a journalist.\par \par \uc2 He graduated in three years, then went on to Harvard Law School -- only to decide, he said in a \uc2 C-Span\uc2  interview, that he needed to ''step away from the treadmill'' to ''decide on my path in life.'' So he took a year off to join Jesuit missionaries in Honduras, an experience friends say had a profound impact, and picked up Spanish.\par \par \uc2 Back at Harvard, he met Anne Holton, his future wife and the daughter of a former Virginia governor, Linwood Holton, a moderate Republican who had desegregated the state's schools.\par \par \uc2 When they married, they settled in Richmond, in an integrated neighborhood, and joined St. Elizabeth, a mostly black Roman Catholic church. Mr. Kaine, who often travels with several harmonicas, sings in the gospel choir and particularly likes ''Wade in the Water,'' an African-American spiritual, according to the Rev. Jim Arsenault, the pastor there.\par \par \uc2 ''Anne and I both decided early on that reconciliation would be the mission of our lives,'' Mr. Kaine told The \uc2 Washington Post\uc2  in 2012. Ms. Holton, a former judge, is now secretary of education in Virginia. They have three children; the eldest is a Marine.\par \par \uc2 In 1994, Mr. Kaine won a seat on the City Council; in 1998, under the system in Richmond at the time, his fellow council members elected him mayor. In that role, his support for keeping an image of Robert E. Lee, the Confederate general, in a city mural drew the ire of the N.A.A.C.P.\par \par \uc2 ''Much of our history is not pleasant; you can't whitewash it,'' Mr. Kaine said then.\par \par \uc2 But he was by all accounts instrumental in bridging the city's racial divide. Viola Baskerville, an African-American colleague, worked with him on an explosive issue: restricting black newspaper vendors, members of the Nation of Islam, from hawking papers on city-owned median strips. Mr. Kaine framed the debate as one of public safety, not race, and black and white council members voted to allow papers to be sold on city sidewalks instead.\par \par \uc2 Ms. Baskerville said she had a sense, early on, that Mr. Kaine had higher aspirations in public life.\par \par \uc2 ''I could tell he had goals, that he was headed somewhere -- and I actually looked at him, and I said, 'You're running for City Council, but I see you in the governor's mansion,''' she said. ''And he kind of laughed at that.''\par \par \uc2 In 2001, a quirk of fate helped Mr. Kaine become Virginia's lieutenant governor. Emily Couric, a state senator and the sister of the television newswoman Katie Couric, bowed out of the race after learning she had pancreatic cancer. Mr. Kaine ran and won, serving under Mark Warner, an old acquaintance from Harvard Law who was elected governor.\par \par \uc2 Critics of Mr. Kaine describe him as Mr. Warner's ''mini-me.''\par \par \uc2 ''He's a company man,'' said Dan Allen, who was an adviser to George Allen (no relation), the Republican Mr. Kaine beat in 2012 to win his Senate seat. ''He was in Mark Warner's footsteps as lieutenant governor, then he was in the footsteps of Obama. From a \uc2 Clinton\uc2  standpoint, this is a guy who's shown a pattern of, he's more than willing to be a follower in the footsteps of whomever is the leader.''\par \par \uc2 Mr. Warner, who is now Mr. Kaine's colleague in the \uc2 United States Senate\uc2 , rejects such characterizations as unfair. He said Mr. Kaine took on issues including tax reform and education, calling him ''a partner'' and a ''steadying force'' as lieutenant governor.\par \par \uc2 Virginia governors serve for only one term, and in 2005 Mr. Kaine ran to succeed Mr. Warner, beating the Republican Jerry Kilgore, then the state's attorney general, in a race where Mr. Kaine's opposition to the death penalty became a central issue. Mr. Kaine managed to deflect it with an ad in which he stared into the camera and declared his position a matter of faith; he won 52 percent of the vote.\par \par \uc2 ''The issue was that Tim Kaine was too liberal for Virginia,'' said Bob Holsworth, a longtime Virginia political analyst. But he said Mr. Kaine also correctly sensed that demographic shifts could work in his favor; rather than concentrate on conservative Democrats in the southwestern part of the state, he ''made a case in the emerging large suburban areas'' that he would address practical and nonpartisan concerns, like limiting growth.\par \par \uc2 On April 16, 2007, Mr. Kaine confronted perhaps his biggest test, the \uc2 Virginia Tech\uc2  shootings. Mr. Kaine, on a trade mission to Japan, quickly flew home to comfort grieving families and confront the carnage -- as well as questions about the state-run university's responsibility for the attack.\par \par \uc2 He commissioned a panel to look into the causes of the massacre, which produced a report that Lori Hanky Haas, whose daughter was wounded in the attack, complained was ''full of glaring holes.'' Family members demanded that he fire the university president; Mr. Kaine refused. Ms. Haas, a gun control advocate, said he seemed caught between his duties as governor and his ''natural inclination to be compassionate to the families.''\par \par \uc2 Aware that restricting gun rights would be a losing cause in Virginia, the home of the \uc2 National Rifle Association\uc2 , Mr. Kaine, a staunch supporter of gun control, used his executive powers to expand mental health services.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Kaine's legislative victories as governor were few; he was stymied by Republicans when he tried to raise taxes, but persuaded lawmakers to pass a statewide smoking ban in restaurants, an achievement in a tobacco-growing state. In a fight with the legislature over budget cuts, his administration closed highway rest stops, saying the money was needed for human services; Republicans viewed it as petulant.\par \par \uc2 In 2007, Mr. Kaine became the first Democratic governor outside Illinois to back Mr. Obama; Mr. Obama considered him as a running mate, but later asked him to be chairman of the Democratic National Committee. Though Democrats lost badly in the 2010 midterm elections, Mr. Kaine mostly escaped blame.\par \par \uc2 In the Senate, Mr. Kaine has carved out a different policy persona than the more centrist Mr. Warner, focusing on issues like Syria and veterans' affairs. In 2013, he made Senate history with a floor speech entirely in Spanish -- an address in support of an immigration law overhaul. He has also battled the White House over Mr. Obama's plans to fight the Islamic State, pointedly telling Mr. Obama that if he intends to go to war, he will have to seek Congress's permission.\par \par \uc2 Like \uc2 Gov. Mike Pence\uc2  of Indiana, the Republican vice-presidential nominee, Mr. Kaine, at his core, is a man of deep religious faith. And while some liberals may have preferred Senators Elizabeth Warren or Bernie Sanders as Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's running mate, Mr. Kaine's allies argue that he is more experienced at threading political needles without alienating people.\par \par \uc2 In 2009, under intense pressure from abortion rights advocates and his own aides to veto a bill allowing ''Choose Life'' license plates, Mr. Kaine signed it anyway, arguing that it would lay the constitutional groundwork for abortion rights advocates to get their own license plate.\par \par \uc2 ''We were all focused on how we were going to get hammered by signing this thing,'' Wayne Turnage, his former chief of staff, recalled, ''and he was three steps in front of us.''\par \par \uc2 Find out what you need to know about the 2016 presidential race today, and get politics news updates via \uc2 Facebook\uc2 , \uc2 Twitter\uc2  and the First Draft newsletter.\par \par \uc2 Top, Tim Kaine, seated at left, then the lieutenant governor of Virginia, with Gov.

\par\par \uc2 Business/Financial Desk; SECT\par \b \uc2 How Fox News's Influence Grew Under Roger Ailes\b0\par\par\uc2 By PRADNYA JOSHI \par \uc2 1,023 \uc2 words\par \uc2 23 July 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 The New York Times on the Web\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Fox News has been the highest-rated cable news network for 15 years, making it a source of immense profit for its parent company, \uc2 21st Century Fox\uc2 . It is a significant voice in national politics and, with its extensive use of graphics and its comfort with editorializing, a major influence on its competitors.\par \par \uc2 The network's pugnacious style and its position as a platform for conservative politics and ideas have made it a hit with an audience that felt ill-served by other news outlets. It has also made the network a target of derision by those who feel it is more a mouthpiece for the Republican Party than a legitimate news network.\par \par \uc2 Through it all, Fox News has been led by Roger Ailes, its chairman. That ended on Thursday when Mr. Ailes was officially ousted after accusations of sexual harassment made by a former anchor.\par \par \uc2 Below, a look at the two-decade shared history of Fox News and Mr. Ailes.\par \par \uc2 Fox News Begins\par \par \uc2 The network was started on Oct. 7, 1996, by \uc2 Rupert Murdoch\uc2 , who hired Roger Ailes as its founding chief executive. Among its first shows were ''The O'Reilly Report'' (later renamed ''The O'Reilly Factor'') and ''Hannity & Colmes.''\par \par \uc2 Executives asserted that the network would take a ''fair and balanced'' approach, and Mr. Ailes said other news outlets were often unfair when covering topics like religion. \uc2 Ted Turner\uc2 , who started \uc2 CNN\uc2  as a 24-hour news channel in 1980, said looked ''forward to crushing \uc2 Rupert Murdoch\uc2  like a bug.''\par \par \uc2 By January 2002, Fox News surpassed \uc2 CNN\uc2  in the ratings and became the No. 1 cable news channel. It has remained on top since.\par \par \uc2 Coverage of Wars in Iraq and Afghanistan\par \par \uc2 After the Sept. 11, attacks, Fox News began promoting military issues. Many programs and correspondents covered the fighting in Afghanistan with a sense of patriotism. Fox News Channel's political talk shows were dominated by conservative commentators, including many of the ''neoconservatives'' who had pushed for the war in Iraq.\par \par \uc2 During the early years of the Iraq war, media critics took note of what seemed to be an explicitly pro-war stance, even when issues like torture and waterboarding came to light.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Ailes never ceded any biases in the news coverage. ''If we look conservative, it's because the other guys are so far to the left,'' Mr. Ailes said in an interview in The \uc2 New York Times Magazine\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Hiring Prominent Journalists\par \par \uc2 Brit Hume, once of ABC News, was one of the most prominent hires that Mr. Ailes made when the network began in 1996. Over the years, he hired Greta Van Susteren away from \uc2 CNN\uc2 , and he hired Chris Wallace, a longtime network correspondent, in 2003.\par \par \uc2 Anchors like Bill O'Reilly, Glenn Beck and Sean Hannity became bona fide stars, with influence that spread beyond the network and made them best-selling authors and highly rated radio hosts.\par \par \uc2 Megyn Kelly has become one of the more recognizable faces on the network, especially during this year's \uc2 election\uc2  cycle.\par \par \uc2 Fodder for Comedy\par \par \uc2 [Video: ''Fox News is like a lying dynasty!'': 16 years of Jon Stewart's best Fox News takedowns Watch on \uc2 YouTube\uc2 .]\par \par \uc2 Fox News's perceived biases and style have long been fodder for various comedians. Fox News hasn't always taken kindly to the criticism. In August 2003, Fox News sued Al Franken (then a comedian, now a senator), saying he had violated its trademark on the slogan ''Fair and Balanced'' in the title for a book he had written. (Fox News lost the suit).\par \par \uc2 The topics of discussion on various \uc2 Fox\uc2  shows were a favorite target for Jon Stewart when he was the host of ''The Daily Show.'' Mr. Stewart said that he talked about the network a lot because it was ''truly a terrible, cynical, disingenuous news organization.''\par \par \uc2 Conservative-leaning pundits, in particular Bill O'Reilly, were also the basis of the character played by \uc2 Stephen Colbert\uc2  on \uc2 Comedy Central\uc2 's ''The Colbert Report.''\par \par \uc2 Tea Party and the 'Birther' Issue\par \par \uc2 [Video: Is the \uc2 IRS\uc2  still targeting Tea Party groups? Watch on \uc2 YouTube\uc2 .]\par \par \uc2 In 2009, as the Tea Party movement gained strength, \uc2 Fox\uc2  hosts actively covered and promoted Tea Party rallies. Issues ranging from big government to questioning President Obama's birthplace were long-running topics of discussion on various shows.\par \par \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2  even entered the ''birther'' debate by notably proclaiming his doubts on Fox News.\par \par \uc2 ''A birther is a person that wants -- these are great Americans in many cases, in most cases -- they want to see the president was born in this country,'' Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  told Fox News's Greta Van Susteren in March 2011. ''They want to see the president actually has a birth certificate.''\par \par \uc2 Tensions between Fox News and the Obama administration escalated in the first term. ''I've got one television station that is entirely devoted to attacking my administration,'' Mr. Obama said in 2009. Over his time in office, however, Mr. Obama has done one-on-one interviews with Fox News hosts like Bill O'Reilly and Chris Wallace.\par \par \uc2 2016 Presidential Race and Gretchen Carlson's Lawsuit\par \par \uc2 Fox News's reach is evident in the latest \uc2 election\uc2  race. Its ratings during primary debates soared, netting viewership generally reserved for popular sports events.\par \par \uc2 The Republican nominee, \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , had a strained relationship with Fox News during the primaries, with the Fox journalist Megyn Kelly becoming one of his biggest objects of ridicule. But after months of hostility and public antics, Ms. Kelly and Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  reached a d\u233\'00\'E9tente of sorts in May. Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  also regularly called in to other shows on the network.\par \par \uc2 [Video: Gretchen's Take: A win for traditional holiday displays Watch on \uc2 YouTube\uc2 .]\par \par \uc2 Just weeks before the national conventions, however, Fox News and Mr. Ailes were again in the spotlight when the former Fox News anchor Gretchen Carlson filed a sexual harassment suit against him. The lawsuit prompted \uc2 21st Century Fox\uc2 , the network's parent company, to start an internal investigation, which eventually led to the departure of Mr. Ailes.\par \par \uc2 Document NYTF000020160723ec7n00047\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 Business/Financial Desk; SECTB\par \b \uc2 Fox's Impact, Absent Ailes\b0\par\par\uc2 By NICK CORASANITI \par \uc2 1,216 \uc2 words\par \uc2 23 July 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 1\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 CLEVELAND -- When \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2  wanted to proclaim his doubts about President Obama's birth certificate, he went to Fox News.\par \par \uc2 ''A birther is a person that wants -- these are great Americans in many cases, in most cases -- they want to see the president was born in this country,'' Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  told Fox News's Greta Van Susteren in March 2011. ''They want to see the president actually has a birth certificate.''\par \par \uc2 The network immediately seized on the birther controversy set off by Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  with a zeal unmatched at the other cable networks. Over the course of the next three months, the word ''birther'' was mentioned on the network by anchors or guests in more than 80 separate broadcasts, according to a review of available Fox transcripts.\par \par \uc2 Ever since Roger Ailes helped found Fox News in 1996, the network has provided a strategic path for Republican politicians and candidates with a message: To raise an issue, set an agenda or change the talk around a charged topic, go to Fox News.\par \par \uc2 Now that Mr. Ailes has stepped down as chairman and chief executive of Fox News in the aftermath of a sexual harassment lawsuit, the television news industry is bracing for a seismic shift. But the impact on the nation's political discourse may be just as significant.\par \par \uc2 For more than two decades, the network helped legitimize political issues like birtherism and ''death panels'' and usher into the mainstream the shock-jock language embraced by Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Without Mr. Ailes guiding the network, conservatives and Republican politicians are left wondering whether the talk might soften under new leadership.\par \par \uc2 ''Roger Ailes is the epitome of somebody that is not politically correct and has the guts to say a lot of what Americans are thinking,'' said Gov. Terry E. Branstad of Iowa, who used Mr. Ailes as a consultant in his early campaigns in 1986 and 1990. He added, ''It will be interesting to see where we go from here.''\par \par \uc2 The unrelenting style of Fox News often proved effective; an issue seized upon by the network would frequently take on urgency.\par \par \uc2 ''I think back to when I was in the Bush White House, there was an issue with management of the ports being sold to a firm out of Dubai, and post-9/11 that was something Fox made an issue,'' said Alex Conant, a founding partner at Firehouse Strategies, a Republican consulting firm. (He was referring to a 2006 controversy over a state-owned Dubai company seeking to manage operations at six major American ports.)\par \par \uc2 Mr. Conant added, ''Once Fox made it an issue, then all of the sudden Congress made it an issue, and it was something that the Bush administration hadn't seen as an issue, but suddenly became a big priority.''\par \par \uc2 With \uc2 Barack Obama\uc2 's \uc2 election\uc2 , the network grew even more vociferous in its coverage, and became a persistent thorn in the side of the president.\par \par \uc2 ''I have this searing memory of sitting at my desk in the Senate office when the madrassa thing first came up, and it appeared on 'Fox and Friends,''' said Tommy Vietor, a former spokesman for Mr. Obama, recalling a false report from the 2008 campaign that Mr. Obama had been educated in a madrassa, or Islamic school.\par \par \uc2 ''I think that was the beginning of an incredible tortured relationship with the network,'' Mr. Vietor added. ''There were times where it felt like every six months we were starting over with them with our approach.''\par \par \uc2 The White House and Fox often tried to repair tensions -- at times David Axelrod would meet directly with Mr. Ailes to address a flare-up -- but those were not always successful.\par \par \uc2 ''Basically, Roger was going to do what Roger was going to do,'' Mr. Axelrod said, calling the Fox News chief ''brilliant.''\par \par \uc2 Tensions have abated over the years, and Mr. Obama recently sat for an interview with Chris Wallace on ''Fox News Sunday.''\par \par \uc2 Many conservatives view the mainstream media networks with skepticism, if not outright disdain, and the advent of Fox News gave a voice to those who had felt ignored or forced into a state of self-censorship. Using ''illegal alien'' when talking about immigration, for example, rather than the more politically correct ''undocumented immigrant,'' became a regular part of political dialogue.\par \par \uc2 ''Without sounding paranoid, when you talk to people in the conservative world, and I'm part of that myself, you did feel that somehow it was stifling, that you could only go so far,'' Representative Peter T. King, Republican of New York, of life before Fox News. ''Roger Ailes provided an opportunity for that voice to come out. But I think we're over that no matter what.''\par \par \uc2 In particular, the network's prime-time stars, like Bill O'Reilly and Sean Hannity, helped bring an in-your-face news presentation to the largest audience possible. Their shows rose to be among the most watched in all of cable television (Mr. O'Reilly's show is No. 1). In turn, the language on their shows often made its way to the stump speeches of candidates, and Fox News found itself playing host to those candidates night after night.\par \par \uc2 ''Obviously, when we were running in the Republican primary, you make your focus Fox News,'' said \uc2 Corey Lewandowski\uc2 , the former campaign manager for Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  and current CNN analyst.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  was on Fox News far more often than any of his Republican rivals. A study by the liberal watchdog group Media Matters found the Republican nominee garnered more than twice as much airtime as his chief rival for the Republican nomination, Senator Ted Cruz.\par \par \uc2 ''I do think Fox News helped \uc2 Trump\uc2  enormously,'' said Rick Tyler, a former senior aide to Mr. Cruz and \uc2 Newt Gingrich\uc2  and currently a political analyst at MSNBC.\par \par \uc2 Some Republicans doubt that there will be any significant change to the network, at least in the near future. (\uc2 Rupert Murdoch\uc2 , who helped Mr. Ailes start Fox News 20 years ago, is taking over from him on an interim basis, a move partly intended as a signal that the network is not on the verge of a wide-ranging overhaul.)\par \par \uc2 ''I don't think it would change, because you've got to be responsible to the shareholders,'' said Rick Santorum, the former senator and presidential candidate. ''It makes money. It's the No. 1 cable channel. Why fix it?''\par \par \uc2 Whether the language begins to soften or change, most candidates know that they can rely on the network's connection with Republican voters.\par \par \uc2 ''My bosses, whoever they have been, including \uc2 Tim Pawlenty\uc2 , Joni Ernst, \uc2 Marco Rubio\uc2 ,'' Mr. Conant, the Republican consultant, said, ''the No. 1 comment they get on the campaign trail is 'I saw you on Fox.'''\par \par \uc2 The Fox News anchor Shepard Smith, left, preparing for a broadcast from the Republican convention in Cleveland.

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 CLEVELAND -- \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2  lashed out at Senator Ted Cruz on Friday, rehashing a long list of grievances from their primary battle during a news conference here only hours after he accepted the Republican Party's presidential nomination at a convention meant to unite the party.\par \par \uc2 After declaring that he had unified the party in one of the most ''love-filled'' conventions in political history, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  launched an extended diatribe against Mr. Cruz, who pointedly declined to endorse him during his own convention speech on Wednesday and instead urged people to vote their conscience. The speech embarrassed Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  and cast a shadow of discord over the convention, which had already been marred by plagiarism in a speech by Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's wife, Melania, on Monday.\par \par \uc2 ''I don't want his endorsement,'' Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  said angrily, in a rambling stream-of-consciousness performance that seemed half stand-up routine, half vengeful rant. ''If he gives it, I won't accept it.''\par \par \uc2 The remarks were a noteworthy display of lingering tension within the party and Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's inability to let go of grudges.\par \par \uc2 They also represented a seemingly inevitable reappearance of Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's irrepressible id. Having spoken from a teleprompter for more than an hour on Thursday, the final day of his convention, he seemed almost incapable of restraining himself any longer as the campaign moved into its next phase.\par \par \uc2 ''Now it was the summer of \uc2 Trump\uc2 , it was the autumn of \uc2 Trump\uc2 , it was the Christmas of \uc2 Trump\uc2 ,'' he said. ''It was everything.''\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  briefly turned his focus from Mr. Cruz to \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , his Democratic opponent, who will be formally nominated next week at her party's convention in Philadelphia. Attention is expected to shift to the Democrats in the coming days, but Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  said that he did not expect to watch Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's speech because she is ''boring.''\par \par \uc2 Democrats did not ignore the Republican National Convention, and they have expressed their concern. Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's campaign made clear that it is aware of the rising stakes of the campaign in an \uc2 Instagram\uc2  message that read: ''The only thing standing between \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  and the White House ... is us.''\par \par \uc2 President Obama also weighed in on Friday, rebutting some of the crime statistics that Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  has presented and refuting his vision of America as a country ''on the verge of collapse.'' During a White House news conference with the president of Mexico, Enrique Pe\u241\'00\'F1a Nieto, Mr. Obama said that any ''vision of violence and chaos everywhere doesn't really jibe with the experience of most people.''\par \par \uc2 Curiously, however, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  was mostly interested in settling old scores the day after his nomination became official. Clearly still stinging from Mr. Cruz's actions, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  ruminated aloud about why the senator from Texas would not back him. He recalled their personal fights during the nominating contests, including an unflattering picture of Mr. Cruz's wife, Heidi, that Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  reposted on \uc2 Twitter\uc2 . Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  also defended his suggestion that Mr. Cruz's father might have played a role in the assassination of President John F. Kennedy, citing a report in The National Enquirer.\par \par \uc2 ''This is a magazine that, frankly, in many respects, should be very respected,'' Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  said of the tabloid.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's comments about Ms. Cruz -- which prompted an audible gasp from a member of his traveling press corps -- is also likely to remind voters that he attacked her during the primary contest. Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  is already struggling to woo female voters, who still view him overwhelmingly negatively, polls show.\par \par \uc2 Trying to explain away the episode also left him in the slightly awkward situation of mentioning Penthouse, a pornographic magazine, while \uc2 Gov. Mike Pence\uc2  of Indiana, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's running mate and a mild-mannered social conservative, stood looking on just behind him. (Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  mentioned the magazine in asserting that a nearly nude picture of his wife was ''artsy'' and in GQ magazine, which he said was hardly Penthouse.)\par \par \uc2 At one point, the Republican nominee quipped that, as president, he might form a ''super PAC'' to challenge a Senate re-\uc2 election\uc2  bid by Mr. Cruz, before questioning the ethics of such a move. And he kept up the personal attacks, saying that Mr. Cruz did not know how to properly use his intellect.\par \par \uc2 ''He's got good intellect, but he doesn't know how to use it; and he was a good debater, but he didn't do well in the debates against me,'' Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  said.\par \par \uc2 Nonetheless, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  said that the convention was a raging success and that the party was, in fact, coming together.\par \par \uc2 ''That was unity,'' Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  said from a downtown hotel here. ''The party has just come together.''\par \par \uc2 While Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's convention speech was generally well received by Republicans, his success at broadening his coalition will become clear in the coming days when a fresh round of polls are released. Nominees generally enjoy a post-convention ''bounce,'' and some pollsters have suggested that Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , who has been running close behind Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  in recent surveys, could either tie or overtake her.\par \par \uc2 Kyle Kondik, of the University of Virginia Center for Politics, said he would be watching to see if Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's level of support nationally surpasses its current ceiling of about 41 percent.\par \par \uc2 ''That will be a sign he's building support and further unifying the G.O.P.,'' Mr. Kondik said. ''If he doesn't, there may be a cap on his level of support that makes it hard for him to win.''\par \par \uc2 Veering off-message could also make victory more of a challenge, and Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  did it repeatedly before returning to New York on Friday.\par \par \uc2 Though Mr. Pence briefly introduced Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  in what was billed as a goodbye reception for supporters, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  called to the stage Dan Scavino Jr. -- his social media director, who took responsibility for much-maligned Star of David Twitter post last month -- before finally letting his running mate address the crowd.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  also praised his former campaign manager, \uc2 Corey Lewandowski\uc2 , before acknowledging key members of his current staff, including \uc2 Paul Manafort\uc2 , who now runs Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's campaign. Mr. Manafort often feuded with Mr. Lewandowski, who was fired last month.\par \par \uc2 ''\uc2 Corey Lewandowski\uc2  was great,'' Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  said. ''And he's been very loyal, he's been on \uc2 CNN\uc2  and he's really been fighting for me, which is very nice, and I respect that.''\par \par \uc2 Mr. Pence, whose brief, humble remarks offered a stark contrast with those of Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , largely struck a posture of benevolent amusement, standing at Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's shoulder and chuckling lightly through the more provocative parts of his rant.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , seemingly in jest, also suggested that he might fault Mr. Pence should he not win the White House in November. ''I ran as an outsider; I didn't want anybody,'' he said. ''Now I have guys like \uc2 Mike Pence\uc2 .''\par \par \uc2 ''See now if I don't win, I'm going to blame Mike, right?''\par \par \uc2 ''We have to blame Mike,'' Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  added, as the small crowd in the hotel ballroom chuckled uncertainly.\par \par \uc2 Find out what you need to know about the 2016 presidential race today, and get politics news updates via \uc2 Facebook\uc2 , \uc2 Twitter\uc2  and the First Draft newsletter.\par \par \uc2 Supporters waiting to meet Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2  after he spoke at a Cleveland hotel on Friday.

DUDZIAK \par \uc2 846 \uc2 words\par \uc2 23 July 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 19\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Although the United States has never perfected the practice of its principles, American leaders from both parties have long seen their country as a model worthy of emulating. The Republican presidential nominee, \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , departed from this view in a striking interview this week with The Times.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  was asked about orders from President \uc2 Recep Tayyip Erdogan\uc2  of Turkey to detain tens of thousands of Turkish citizens. Asked whether he would press Mr. Erdogan ''to make sure the rule of law applies,'' Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  did not emphasize the delicate nature of criticizing a strategically important ally. Instead, he focused inward, saying that ''when it comes to civil liberties, our country has a lot of problems, and I think it's very hard for us to get involved in other countries when we don't know what we are doing and we can't see straight in our own country.''\par \par \uc2 The problems he had in mind were ''policemen being shot in the streets, when you have riots, when you have Ferguson. When you have Baltimore.'' The United States needs ''to focus on those problems,'' he said.\par \par \uc2 This argument -- that the United States could not be a model because of its domestic problems -- was made during the early years of the Cold War, when racial segregation and violence against civil rights demonstrators generated international criticism. But this case was made by Soviet propagandists, not American presidential candidates.\par \par \uc2 During the 1957 crisis over school desegregation in Little Rock, Ark., for example, the Soviet newspaper Izvestia criticized American leaders for having ''audacity to talk about 'democracy' and speak as supporters of 'freedom' '' while racist mobs barred nine African-American students from Little Rock's Central High School. Sympathetic foreign observers expressed concern that American race discrimination undermined the ability of the United States to condemn injustice elsewhere.\par \par \uc2 American presidents during the height of the civil rights movement, like Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  today, thought that foreign criticism mattered. But it did not cause them to refrain from censuring authoritarianism. Instead, they worked to address injustice at home in part to protect America's role in the world.\par \par \uc2 President Dwight D. Eisenhower, a Republican, is a good example. Shortly before the crisis in Little Rock, Eisenhower said that he could not imagine using federal troops to enforce a desegregation order. Two months later, he reversed his position. In an address to the nation, which his secretary of state, John Foster Dulles, helped draft, the president said it was ''difficult to exaggerate the harm that is being done to the prestige and influence, and indeed to the safety, of our nation and the world'' by the racial unrest.\par \par \uc2 Federal troops would do more than bring law and order to Little Rock and enable African-American students to attend Central High School, Eisenhower said. Resolving the crisis would remove ''a blot upon the fair name and high honor of our nation in the world,'' and would restore the image of American democracy.\par \par \uc2 In May 1963, when the police in Birmingham, Ala., brutalized civil rights demonstrators, people around the world reacted in horror. It was in part because, as President John F. Kennedy put it, ''we preach freedom around the world'' that he justified federal intervention. Calling civil rights ''a moral issue'' that was ''as clear as the American Constitution,'' he linked internal America's domestic struggles with its global leadership: ''Are we to say to the world, and much more importantly, to each other that this is the land of the free except for the Negroes?'' Kennedy asked.\par \par \uc2 Past presidents have had various motivations beyond a commitment to the ideal (if not the full implementation) of equality. One reason, pressed by successive secretaries of state, was that protecting rights at home mattered to America's global standing. In this light, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's comments illuminate his campaign's ''America First'' ideology. He rejects the idea that American moral leadership matters.\par \par \uc2 If American values of justice don't matter to diplomacy, they appear to matter even less at home. Rather than promoting a resolution of the racial tensions that prompted the \uc2 Black Lives Matter movement\uc2 , Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  has called the protesters ''a disgrace'' and told Fox News Channel that ''I think they're looking for trouble.''\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's war on American values, and his effort to hollow out the nation's image in the world, was, of course, already apparent in his rhetoric about Mexican immigrants and Muslims. As the world looks at the United States' \uc2 election\uc2  this year, it is ultimately the American electorate that will have a final say about whether we, as a nation, are ready to embrace the idea that American democracy has nothing to offer the world.\par \par \uc2 Follow The \uc2 New York Times\uc2  Opinion section on \uc2 Facebook\uc2  and \uc2 Twitter\uc2  (@NYTopinion), and sign up for the Opinion Today newsletter.\par \par \uc2 Mary L.

\par\par \uc2 National Desk; SECTA\par \b \uc2 Clinton\uc2  Names a Senator as Vice-Presidential Pick\b0\par\par\uc2 By AMY CHOZICK, ALAN RAPPEPORT and JONATHAN MARTIN; Amy Chozick reported from Tampa, and Alan Rappeport and Jonathan Martin from Cleveland. \par \uc2 1,661 \uc2 words\par \uc2 23 July 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 1\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 TAMPA, Fla. -- \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  named Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia to be her running mate Friday, selecting a battleground-state politician with working-class roots and a fluency in Spanish, traits that she believes can bolster her chances to defeat \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2  in November.\par \par \uc2 Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's choice, which she announced via text message to supporters, came after her advisers spent months poring over potential vice-presidential candidates who could lift the Democratic ticket in an unpredictable race against Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 In the end, Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  decided that Mr. Kaine, 58, a former governor of Virginia who sits on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, had the qualifications and background, and the personal chemistry with her, to make the ticket a success.\par \par \uc2 Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  had entertained more daring choices. She considered Thomas E. Perez, the secretary of labor, who would have been the first Hispanic on a major party ticket; Senator \uc2 Cory Booker\uc2  of New Jersey, who would have been the first African-American to seek the vice presidency; and James G. Stavridis, a retired four-star Navy admiral who served as the supreme allied commander at NATO but had never held elected office.\par \par \uc2 Ultimately, Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , who told PBS that she was ''afflicted with the responsibility gene,'' avoided taking a chance with a less experienced vice-presidential candidate and declined to push the historic nature of her candidacy by adding another woman or a minority to the ticket.\par \par \uc2 Instead, the campaign, which had become concerned about its deficit with white men, focused on Mr. Kaine and Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack, and looked more closely at Gov. John Hickenlooper of Colorado.\par \par \uc2 At a campaign stop with Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  in Annandale, Va., last week, Mr. Kaine tried out for the role. ''Do you want a 'You're fired' president or a 'You're hired' president?'' he asked the crowd. ''Do you want a trash-talker president or a bridge-builder president?'' He compared Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's record of public service to that of his wife, Anne Holton, Virginia's secretary of education. In recent days, former President \uc2 Bill \uc2 Clinton\uc2  and the White House had expressed support for Mr. Kaine.\par \par \uc2 I'm thrilled to announce my running mate, @TimKaine, a man who's devoted his life to fighting for others. -H pic.twitter.com/lTVyfztE5Z -- \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  (@HillaryClinton) July 23, 2016\par \par \uc2 Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  will formally introduce Mr. Kaine as her running mate at a campaign stop on Saturday at \uc2 Florida International University\uc2  in Miami, which has a large number of Hispanic students.\par \par \uc2 The announcement came after a day of campaign events in Orlando and Tampa in which Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  tried to offer a rebuke, both in actions and in words, to the Republican National Convention in Cleveland.\par \par \uc2 In Orlando, she laid flowers on a makeshift memorial outside the Pulse nightclub, where a gunman who expressed sympathy with the Islamic State killed 49 people last month. At an earlier round-table discussion with emergency medical workers and elected officials, Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  nodded solemnly and hardly spoke, an implicit contrast with Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's 75-minute speech on Thursday night.\par \par \uc2 At a rally in Tampa on Friday evening, Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  blasted the bleak vision of America presented by her Republican rival. ''The last thing that we need is somebody who is running for president who talks trash about America,'' Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  said.\par \par \uc2 She showed solidarity with Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's top primary rival, Senator Ted Cruz of Texas. ''I mean, I never thought I'd say these words, but Ted Cruz was right,'' she said, and then quoted Mr. Cruz's despondent Wednesday night speech. ''Vote your conscience.''\par \par \uc2 Now some of the job of discrediting Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  will fall to Mr. Kaine, who wrote on \uc2 Twitter\uc2  that he was eager to hit the campaign trail.\par \par \uc2 ''Just got off the phone with Hillary,'' he said. ''I'm honored to be her running mate.''\par \par \uc2 Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  and Mr. Kaine have similar positions on many issues, and they are said to share an easy rapport and an interest in policy details. ''I do have a fondness for wonks,'' Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  said in the PBS interview.\par \par \uc2 Asked whether Mr. Kaine was boring, Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  said, ''I love that about him.'' She added, ''He's never lost an \uc2 election\uc2 .''\par \par \uc2 Republicans seized on the selection and tried to sow discord among Democrats, arguing that the pick was evidence that Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  had been dishonest with her party's liberal base.\par \par \uc2 ''\uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's choice of Tim Kaine does nothing to unify a fractured Democrat base which is repelled by her dishonesty and cronyism,'' Reince Priebus, the chairman of the Republican National Committee, said in a statement. ''After spending last week pandering to grass-roots Democrats with Bernie Sanders, \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  has chosen someone who holds positions that she's spent the entire primary trying to get to the left of.''\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 Trump\uc2  campaign quickly labeled Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's new running mate ''Corrupt Kaine,'' pointing to lavish gifts he had received during his years as governor and lieutenant governor of Virginia.\par \par \uc2 ''It's only fitting that \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  would select an ethically challenged insider like Tim Kaine who's personally benefited from the rigged system,'' said Jason Miller, a spokesman for Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 While many Democrats swiftly praised the move, some in the party's liberal wing expressed dismay, claiming that Mr. Kaine was out of step with it on some of its core issues, like trade.\par \par \uc2 ''As we saw in \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2 's speech last night, Republicans will run hard against Democrats on trade this year,'' said Stephanie Taylor, a co-founder of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee. ''Unfortunately, since Tim Kaine voted to fast-track the Trans-Pacific Partnership, Republicans now have a new opening to attack Democrats on this economic populist issue.''\par \par \uc2 She added, ''The mood of the country is a populist one.''\par \par \uc2 The son of a welder who owned a small metalworking shop, Mr. Kaine, a Roman Catholic, grew up around Kansas City, Mo. He attended a Jesuit school and took a break from law school at Harvard to spend time as a Catholic missionary in Honduras, an experience that his family has said shaped him and helped him become fluent in Spanish.\par \par \uc2 Early in his career, Mr. Kaine worked on fair housing and civil rights issues as a lawyer. He was elected to the City Council in Richmond, Va., in 1994, and proceeded to climb the ranks of elected office in the state. He became the city's mayor in 1998, the state's lieutenant governor in 2002 and the governor in 2006. He also served as chairman of the Democratic National Committee.\par \par \uc2 As governor, Mr. Kaine drew some support from rural parts of the state as well as strong backing in the state's Democratic-leaning suburban areas. He led the state through one of its darkest times, the shooting at \uc2 Virginia Tech\uc2  that killed 32 people in 2007. In 2013, Mr. Kaine implored the \uc2 United States Senate\uc2  to find a ''small measure of courage'' to fight the gun lobby and impose tougher background checks on gun ownership.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Kaine was an early endorser of Senator \uc2 Barack Obama\uc2 's presidential bid in the 2008 nominating fight against Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 . Mr. Kaine was also considered on Mr. Obama's shortlist of vice-presidential candidates before Mr. Obama selected Senator \uc2 Joseph R. Biden Jr\uc2 . of Delaware. In 2012, Mr. Kaine defeated George Allen, a Republican, to take the Senate seat being vacated by the Democrat Jim Webb.\par \par \uc2 Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's choice of Mr. Kaine underscores the rising political importance of Virginia, a state with a significant suburban and minority population.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Obama defeated \uc2 John McCain\uc2  in the state by more than six percentage points, the first time since Lyndon B. Johnson's victory in 1964 that the state had voted for a Democratic presidential nominee. An NBC News-Wall Street Journal poll from July 15 shows Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  ahead of Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  for the state's 13 electoral votes by nine percentage points.\par \par \uc2 The search for a running mate began in April, after Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  had decisively won the New York primary, with a number of candidates.\par \par \uc2 Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  came to the process with a unique vantage point, having been closely involved in her husband's selection of Senator Al Gore of Tennessee in 1992, a choice that brought youth and Southern charm to a ticket already overflowing with it.\par \par \uc2 With just days remaining before her announcement of a running mate, Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  had not yet made up her mind as her advisers debated what attributes voters might want in a vice president.\par \par \uc2 As the search narrowed, Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  wanted to test her chemistry on the campaign trail with Mr. Kaine. After their Virginia rally last week, she invited him to her home in Washington for a meeting that lasted until 10:30 p.m.\par \par \uc2 Last Saturday, the day after meeting with other candidates in Washington, she invited Mr. Kaine and his wife to lunch at her home in Chappaqua, N.Y., with her family.\par \par \uc2 At 7:30 p.m. Friday, just after her fiery speech in Tampa, Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  called Mr. Kaine to give him the news, before calling President Obama to let him know that she had chosen his friend.\par \par \uc2 Find out what you need to know about the 2016 presidential race today, and get politics news updates via \uc2 Facebook\uc2 , \uc2 Twitter\uc2  and the First Draft newsletter.\par \par \uc2 Tim Kaine is on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.

\par\par \uc2 NEWS ANALYSIS\par \uc2 National Desk; SECTA\par \b \uc2 With Running Mate, \uc2 Clinton\uc2  Looks Beyond Inauguration Day\b0\par\par\uc2 By PATRICK HEALY \par \uc2 1,357 \uc2 words\par \uc2 23 July 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 9\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 In selecting Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia as her running mate, \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  is sending the clearest signal yet that she is confident she will win the presidential \uc2 election\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 If she were worried, she would have chosen Senator Sherrod Brown of Ohio, who could have helped her win that critical Midwestern state -- where she is now tied with \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2 . And Mr. Brown could have energized progressives nationally, who were far more enthusiastic about Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont than they have been about Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Other picks could have helped her more on \uc2 Election\uc2  Day. Former Gov. Tom Vilsack of Iowa, for instance, would have turned out Democrats and independents in his swing state. Senator \uc2 Cory Booker\uc2  of New Jersey would have galvanized fellow African-Americans in key cities like Philadelphia and Detroit. Tom Perez, labor secretary, and Julian Castro, housing secretary, might have boosted Hispanic voting in Florida and the West.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Kaine, by contrast, doesn't bring obvious political rewards. Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  is likely to win his home state of Virginia in any case. The members of his natural demographic -- white men -- aren't going to forget their problems with Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  just because Mr. Kaine is on the ticket. And he isn't a break-up-the-big-banks liberal who will bring home the left wing of the party.\par \par \uc2 His value is almost entirely about governing -- about what he can do for Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  in the White House rather than at the ballot box. To that end, the pick is deeply revealing about how she sees the general \uc2 election\uc2  and how she would govern as president.\par \par \uc2 She already has a strong team.\par \par \uc2 Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  is showing her cards: In her view, she already has a straight flush heading into the fall with President Obama, former President \uc2 Bill \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , Vice President \uc2 Joseph R. Biden Jr\uc2 ., Mr. Sanders and Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts ready to campaign for her. She doesn't think she needs an ace in the hole in November, according to \uc2 Clinton\uc2  advisers.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Kaine's chief job in the general \uc2 election\uc2  is to win the vice-presidential debate on Oct. 4 -- it happens to be in Virginia -- against his Republican counterpart, \uc2 Gov. Mike Pence\uc2  of Indiana. Mr. Kaine and Mr. Pence are both solid debaters, but Mr. Kaine is more natural as an attack dog, a quality that Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  prizes. And as a member of both the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and the Armed Services Committee, he is well suited to highlighting Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's knowledge deficits on world affairs.\par \par \uc2 Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  herself is more popular than Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  with women, Hispanics, African-Americans and immigrants, which gives her some assurance that she can carry these voters without any particular help from her running mate, her advisers say. She is optimistic that because Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  is so divisive, she has no reason to fear him in traditionally Democratic states. She is investing far more money than the \uc2 Trump\uc2  campaign in voter turnout operations in battleground states, as well as spending far more on television commercials.\par \par \uc2 They align on policy and style.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Kaine is a strong advocate of gun control, opposes the death penalty and favored the Iran nuclear deal. He has also backed some restrictions on abortion and is a strong supporter of Israel. While he holds many progressive views, the fact that he does not come across as a fire-breathing partisan has helped give him a reputation as a moderate. He comes across like the nuts-and-bolts governor and mayor he once was -- perhaps even a little boring -- but it's a style and approach to governing that won't upstage Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 ''Tim is a sensible and pragmatic guy whose presence on the ticket will be very reassuring to centrist Democrats,'' said Steven Rattner, a Wall Street financier and longtime ally of the Clintons.\par \par \uc2 That won't be so reassuring for supporters of Mr. Sanders, however. Mr. Kaine has supported free trade deals like the Trans-Pacific Partnership that Mr. Sanders, Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's top rival for the Democratic nomination, and other liberals regard as job and wage killers. Mr. Kaine hasn't been an outspoken champion for the extensive overhauls of banking and Wall Street regulations that Mr. Sanders wants, nor has he been an advocate for sharply raising taxes on the wealthy.\par \par \uc2 Democrats close to Mr. Sanders, who has already endorsed Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , say they do not expect him to lead a revolt against Mr. Kaine, who the Vermont senator has called ''a very decent guy.'' \uc2 Clinton\uc2  advisers say they are hopeful that Mr. Kaine will win over more progressives with his stand on guns and his lines of attack against Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 . They also say that picking Mr. Brown, or even Ms. Warren, was problematic because Republican governors would have filled those seats, hurting Democratic chances of retaking the Senate. Virginia's Democratic governor, \uc2 Terry McAuliffe\uc2 , will replace Mr. Kaine if he and Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  win.\par \par \uc2 He keeps his ego in check.\par \par \uc2 Among Democrats who know him well, Mr. Kaine is considered a self-effacing workhorse who shuns the spotlight and prefers digging into domestic policy and national security rather than showboating on Sunday news programs. Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  sees herself in much the same way. Unlike some of his rivals for the ticket, he is widely viewed by colleagues as fully capable of being president -- Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's top criterion for a running mate.\par \par \uc2 Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  also wants a vice president who acts as a sounding board for her, as Mr. Biden did for Mr. Obama and Al Gore for her husband, and can handle any task, domestic or foreign. Given his decades of experience in government and politics, Mr. Kaine wouldn't face much of a learning curve as No. 2 to Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , who is itching to dive into work after Inauguration Day. He is a strong advocate of comprehensive immigration reform and a fluent Spanish speaker, which she thinks could make him a valuable emissary on the issue with voters and former Senate colleagues.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Kaine has a down-to-earth style, and drew praise for his response to the mass shooting on the \uc2 Virginia Tech\uc2  campus in 2007. He also received high marks when he delivered strongly bipartisan message in response to President Bush's State of the Union address in 2006.\par \par \uc2 Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , with her reputation for partisanship and unpopularity with Republicans, was eager for a governing partner who would help reach out to the other party.\par \par \uc2 ''Kaine's was one of the best State of the Union responses that we ever tested with focus groups of swing voters,'' said \uc2 Frank Luntz\uc2 , the Republican pollster. ''For him it wasn't about ideology, but being practical and having common sense.''\par \par \uc2 He gets along with her husband.\par \par \uc2 Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  also wants a vice president who would have a good relationship with Mr. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , especially since the two-term president would likely have some sort of policy role and be an outside presence in the White House. Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  remembers her rivalry with Mr. Gore during the first two years of the \uc2 Clinton\uc2  administration and wants to avoid distractions like tension between Mr. Kaine and Mr. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 So far the signs are good: Mr. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  strongly supported the choice of Mr. Kaine, \uc2 Clinton\uc2  advisers say, and the two share similar policy views and were governors of Southern states.\par \par \uc2 But Mr. Kaine is also a relatively low-key person who understands the importance of ceding the spotlight to the Clintons, according to Democrats close to him.\par \par \uc2 He is wholly capable, they say, of swallowing his ego and keeping his own political ambitions in check as he serves the interests of a president and a former president.\par \par \uc2 ''Secretary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  needed someone who wanted to do the job while knowing that they'd be the third wheel,'' said Ben Tulchin, a Democratic pollster who worked for Mr. Sanders in his race against Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 . ''She needed a safe personality, a good soldier, and that's Tim Kaine.''\par \par \uc2 Document NYTF000020160723ec7n0003e\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 CLEVELAND -- The balloon drop, at least, went well for \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2  -- a glorious cascade of color, released from the rafters, that flittered around the beaming billionaire after he was confirmed as the Republican presidential nominee in an arena packed with roaring supporters on Thursday night. Earlier in this convention week, though, little seemed to be going to plan.\par \par \uc2 On Day 1, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's supermodel wife, Melania, became entangled in a plagiarism scandal after it emerged that part of her speech had been copied from one given by Michelle Obama. Two days later, one of his vanquished rivals, Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, caused consternation with a defiant speech in which he refused to endorse Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 There was an embarrassing, if short-lived, attempt by anti-\uc2 Trump\uc2  Republicans to block his nomination. Party delegates booed some speakers, and deserted the hall when others were still on stage. Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  himself disrupted any semblance of message discipline, appearing on Fox News one evening during the proceedings, which led to split-screen dizziness, and giving a foreign-policy interview in which he made several startling statements.\par \par \uc2 As the surprises tripped one into another, providing rich fodder for the 15,000 journalists who had flooded into Cleveland, it seemed that Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  had approached the convention in the same seat-of-his-pants manner that served him so well in the Republican primary elections this spring, when he steadily dispatched a field of 16 opponents.\par \par \uc2 While political pundits spent much of the week tsk-tsk'ing the \uc2 Trump\uc2  team for lacking control of the conclave, they have been proven wrong over and over in this unconventional year, in which the former reality television star not only threw out the old playbook but also seems to be operating without a playbook at all.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's thunderous and fear-laden acceptance speech Thursday night got a roaring welcome in the convention hall, but the chaos of the past week renewed broader questions about the haphazard and deeply self-involved style that assured his stunning success up to now. Among some Republicans, it has reinforced doubts about whether Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , who has built his campaign around whim and impulse, can now harness that into a viable force to beat the Democratic contender, \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , in November -- and to run the most powerful country on earth.\par \par \uc2 ''You look at that, and the conclusion you come to is that this is not a serious endeavor to elect someone president,'' Stuart Stevens, who was the chief strategist to the 2012 Republican nominee, \uc2 Mitt Romney\uc2 , said of the convention. ''It's just about ego.''\par \par \uc2 Every twist of Cleveland crazy was fed into the instant grinder of social media and news websites, obscuring the messages from the podium to the party faithful: testimonials from Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's wife and children to soften his often belligerent persona; rallying calls to unify his bitterly divided party; and the elevation of his gentle-mannered running mate, \uc2 Gov. Mike Pence\uc2  of Indiana.\par \par \uc2 Modern American political conventions have not been like this. Back in the 1960s and 1970s, they could be dramatic affairs, with openly fought political battles, back-room deals and violent clashes between protesters and the police.\par \par \uc2 But in recent decades, they have evolved into polished, meticulously scripted events whose main purpose is to serve as an extended infomercial on prime-time television. Over four days, the particular party rolls out its \uc2 election\uc2  message, unifies behind its anointed candidate, seeds attacks against the other side, and steels itself for the battle ahead.\par \par \uc2 For Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , Cleveland offered a golden opportunity for him to counter his many critics by projecting a presidential air and trying to broaden his largely white support base. Thousands of journalists set up temporary bases inside a vast, hangar-like hall that was divided by blue curtains, giving it the air of a labyrinthine changing room. Television studios and social media companies like \uc2 Facebook\uc2  and \uc2 Twitter\uc2  hired out local restaurants to serve as studios or hospitality suites.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  appeared to be far less organized. He applied himself to the convention just a few weeks before it started. Many decisions were entrusted to his adult children, which slowed up the process. He struggled to assemble a roster of celebrity speakers to speak in his favor. (The eventual list included several 80s-era soap opera stars, a little-known businessman and a former underwear model.)\par \par \uc2 The improvised nature of some preparations showed during the convention, in gaffes such as the failure to vet the speeches for plagiarism -- a common precaution before any major political event. Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , meanwhile, appeared reluctant to share the limelight, appearing on the convention stage on three nights, instead of the normal one.\par \par \uc2 As ever, for the media, he was ratings gold. ''It has been chaotic,'' Jake Tapper, the \uc2 CNN\uc2  host, said in an interview. ''The language was sometimes strong. There's been controversy, then more controversy. And it's been exciting.''\par \par \uc2 Maybe that was part of the playbook after all. In a sense, it is business as usual for Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , a New York real estate mogul whose improbable political career was kick-started by a stint in reality television, and who during the primaries kept himself in the headlines with a stream of vulgarities and provocations that would have torpedoed the careers of other politicians.\par \par \uc2 No matter how many times Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  issued boyish insults against other candidates, or faced newspaper stories that exposed his business dealings, his sexism or his distortions (something Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  has euphemistically called ''truthful hyperbole''), people kept voting for him at the polls.\par \par \uc2 The convention started in a similar vein when a New Yorker article appeared in which Tony Schwartz, the ghostwriter for Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's autobiography, ''The Art of the Deal,'' described his subject as a self-obsessed sociopath who had a childlike attention span. Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  responded by issuing Mr. Schwartz with a legal notice.\par \par \uc2 Now, though, his supporters worry that his Teflon popularity will wear thin. Inside the Republican party, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's unpredictability has become a source of gnawing disquiet. ''He's just not the normal candidate,'' said David Foreman, a delegate from Texas, complete with cowboy hat, during a break in speeches in Cleveland. ''He's great talking, and people like that. But it scares them too. You never know what he's going to say next.''\par \par \uc2 The broader question about the messy Cleveland convention is whether it will help or damage his popularity -- and whether the chaos will continue through the fall.\par \par \uc2 Republican operatives like Mr. Stevens predict his campaign will be swamped by Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's slicker, better-funded effort. ''It's like watching an amateur sports team playing professionals,'' he said. ''The amateurs might hang in there in the beginning. But by the end it's not very pretty.''\par \par \uc2 Then again, Mr. Stevens's candidate lost in 2012. And Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  can point to his long record of outwitting his detractors. At least on Thursday's closing night of the convention, his speech showed that his ability to tap the emotions and fears of his supporters remains undiminished.\par \par \uc2 During a lengthy address in which he presented the United States as a country besieged by dangerous enemies, among them Islamic State terrorists and domestic criminals, the crowd repeatedly erupted into chants of ''U-S-A''.\par \par \uc2 ''History is watching us now,'' said Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 . ''We don't have much time.''\par \par \uc2 Declan Walsh, the Cairo bureau chief, is covering the American political campaign as a foreign correspondent.\par \par \uc2 Document NYTF000020160723ec7n0003a\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 To the Editor:\par \par \uc2 Regarding \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's selection of Tim Kaine as her vice-presidential running mate (nytimes.com, July 22):\par \par \uc2 In 1993, while living in Richmond, Va., I attended a series of panel discussions on racism in our community presented at a neighborhood Presbyterian church. After a presentation by a diverse panel, a young man dressed in a well-worn brown tweed coat and loosened tie, as if coming from a long day's work, stood up and spoke.\par \par \uc2 He spoke with such calm but fervent passion and knowledge of the issues. He was as articulate as anyone I had ever heard speak about the impact of injustice and power inequity in our community and beyond. I continued to attend the series of discussions, always hoping to hear from that young man, and was never disappointed.\par \par \uc2 He seemed a person of profound integrity and honor. That young man's name was Tim Kaine. We moved from Virginia, but I have followed Tim's career in politics and believe that my first impressions of him have been verified and amplified over the years. I am thrilled and feel quite secure to think of him as vice president of the United States.\par \par \uc2 CATHY SOBEL\par \par \uc2 Seattle\par \par \uc2 To the Editor:\par \par \uc2 One could hardly make two less inspiring choices for vice president than Tim Kaine for \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  and \uc2 Mike Pence\uc2  for \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 I didn't expect either Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  or Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  to choose anyone who would upstage them, and they certainly didn't disappoint in that regard.

\par\par \b \uc2 Election\uc2  2016: Reshaping of Supreme Court Is Likely --- Shift in bench's dynamics is expected as multiple seats may open after \uc2 election\b0\par\par\uc2 By Jess Bravin   \par \uc2 718 \uc2 words\par \uc2 23 July 2016\par \uc2 The Wall Street Journal\par \uc2 J\par A4\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 Republicans and Democrats on the campaign trail say the 2016 \uc2 election\uc2  could reshape the Supreme Court for decades. They are right.\par \par \uc2 The next president could fill a vacancy created by Justice Antonin Scalia's February death and two or more additional seats as elderly justices retire. The changes likely will shift the court from its current makeup of four liberals and four conservatives, shaping some of the nation's most significant issues on social norms, individual rights, balance of government powers and business and workplace matters.\par \par \uc2 "It's pretty rare that it's an evenly balanced court about to go one way or another, so the stakes have never been higher," said John Aldrich, a political-science professor at Duke University.\par \par \uc2 Senate Republicans have declined to consider the nominee President \uc2 Barack Obama\uc2  announced in March, U.S. Circuit Judge \uc2 Merrick Garland\uc2 , aiming to keep the seat open in the hope Republican nominee \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  wins the White House and appoints a conservative justice.\par \par \uc2 That would restart a decadeslong conservative drive that ground to a halt with Justice Scalia's death, affecting the outcome of several cases on issues such as the power of public-employee unions, religious exemptions from the health-care law and the extent of federal authority to set national policy over objections from states or private interests.\par \par \uc2 A win by Democrat \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , in contrast, would set the stage for a liberal majority on the Supreme Court, something not seen since the retirement of Chief Justice Earl Warren in 1969.\par \par \uc2 What that might mean is "hard to contemplate," said Carlton Larson, a law professor at the University of California, Davis. "For my entire life, we've had a conservative-moderate court," he said, adding "in terms of an aggressive liberal agenda, there probably isn't one today."\par \par \uc2 The gay rights issue has been an exception, but following the 2015 decision affording marriage to same-sex couples, "the big gay-rights cases have already been dealt with," he said. Over recent decades, the court's liberals primarily have focused on defending from conservative challenge mid-20th century precedents that expanded civil rights and upheld social-welfare legislation, something that is likely to continue.\par \par \uc2 Elizabeth Slattery\uc2 , a legal fellow at the conservative \uc2 Heritage Foundation\uc2 , said she expects a liberal majority would try "to restrict religious liberty to the four walls of a house of worship," possibly by targeting the 2014 Hobby Lobby decision that allowed for-profit corporations to seek religious exceptions to legal obligations under the Religious Freedom Restoration Act. Liberal justices may be skeptical of laws that allow officials or businesses with religious objections to homosexuality to avoid providing services to married same-sex couples.\par \par \uc2 The landscape in the legal fight over abortion also could change with multiple appointments. A court with two or more new conservatives could throw into doubt the 1973 Roe v. Wade decision recognizing a woman's right to abortion and create more leeway for state curbs on the procedure. In contrast, more liberals on the court could bolster abortion rights.\par \par \uc2 A single Democratic appointment to the Supreme Court could doom the 2010 \uc2 Citizens United\uc2  decision, which struck down restrictions on corporate and union political spending. That ruling and other opinions invalidating campaign finance laws came on 5-4 conservative majority votes that said restrictions on finance amounted to a restraint of free speech. A \uc2 Clinton\uc2  appointee almost certainly would join liberal justices who dispute that analogy and have signaled an intent to significantly narrow or overrule the \uc2 Citizens United\uc2  ruling.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  has said he would appoint conservative justices sure to share the former court majority's deep skepticism of campaign finance regulations.\par \par \uc2 Gun rights and the death penalty, among other contentious issues, also likely depend on the next appointments. Supreme Court rulings in 2008 and 2010 held 5-4 that the Second Amendment provides individuals a right to keep a handgun in the home for self-defense. Since then, the court has done little to clarify whether gun rights extend further, letting stand lower-court decisions that usually have upheld restrictions on semiautomatic weapons, for example.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=wjco20160723000097"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document J000000020160723ec7n0002l\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw272\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4080\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 Letters to the Editor\par \b \uc2 Populism and the Fear of Destructive Change\b0\par\par\uc2 557 \uc2 words\par \uc2 23 July 2016\par \uc2 The Wall Street Journal\par \uc2 J\par A12\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 David Frum's essay "The \uc2 Trump\uc2  Before \uc2 Trump\uc2 " (Review, July 16) gets far more wrong about William Jennings Bryan, empirically and analytically, than it gets right. Two examples among many: First, in each of his campaigns, Bryan worked hard to win over industrial workers. He spent more time in the industrial Midwest than anywhere else, and many of his supporters thought he lost in 1896 because employers threatened to fire any workers who voted Democratic. Second, H.L. Mencken and Bryan agreed about almost nothing. Mencken opposed U.S. entry into World War I because he was pro-German; Bryan opposed it (until the declaration of war) because he thought the war, like most wars, was immoral and wouldn't achieve its purpose. Otherwise, Mencken was a cynical conservative who detested Bryan as both a dangerous radical and a religious zealot. He did admire his oratorical skills, though.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Frum should have added that Bryan, unlike Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2 , was a lifelong member of his party and adhered to its platforms. And Bryan lost his race for the Senate only because the Republicans won control of the Nebraska legislature in 1894. (This was before the 17th amendment.) In a nonbinding preference vote on \uc2 Election\uc2  Day, he "defeated" his GOP opponent 73% to 27%. Moreover, Bryan was a man of deep moral and religious principle -- whatever one thinks of those beliefs. \uc2 Trump\uc2  believes primarily in himself.\par \par \uc2 Prof. Michael Kazin\par \par \uc2 Georgetown University\par \par \uc2 Washington\par \par \uc2 ---\par \par \uc2 Apparently, Mr. Frum believes Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  and his followers are simple-mindedly driven by racist and jingoistic opposition to immigration and free trade. It goes deeper than that. Mr. Frum fails to realize that voters' exasperation on these issues is caused by the oppressive stranglehold that today's federal government has on virtually everything. A national government that refuses to enforce its own immigration laws and tells objecting citizens that they are morally wrong is a government that cares nothing for the rule of law -- a dictatorship. The immigration issue is but one part of the raging frustration, not its totality. Unlike the problems faced by Bryan, this is a problem that can be changed by new leadership.\par \par \uc2 Geoffrey C. Price\par \par \uc2 Austin, Texas\par \par \uc2 ---\par \par \uc2 Mr. Frum clearly identifies the great social and economic transition taking place in America today and provides a historical review of how existing political parties have transitioned over the years. The drafters of the American Constitution were perceptive about the challenges of a democracy. A formal tripartite form of national government with separation of powers was determined to be the instrument for arriving at comity and unity. But the degeneration into partisan political parties perversely transformed what was intended to stimulate rational discourse, compromise, consensus and enlightened decision-making instead into a crude tool of unending electioneering, demagoguery, naked pursuit of political advantage and the traditional rewards of privilege, favoritism, patronage and corruption.\par \par \uc2 The Obama \uc2 election\uc2 , in effect, turned over the stone that exposed all the ugliness that lay beneath. Lamentably, there is no evidence of anyone in the 2016 \uc2 election\uc2  to date possessing the inspired leadership gifts necessary to safely navigate the country through this confounding social and economic transition. Can America wait and stumble along for four more years?\par \par \uc2 Herbert L.

\par\par \b \uc2 Trump\uc2  Makes His Case --- GOP Hopes to Blaze New Trail to Victory\b0\par\par\uc2 By Patrick O'Connor   \par \uc2 1,110 \uc2 words\par \uc2 22 July 2016\par \uc2 The Wall Street Journal\par \uc2 J\par A1\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 Corrections & Amplifications\par \par \uc2 Jeff Roe was the campaign manager for Texas Sen. Ted Cruz's presidential bid. A Page One article Friday about Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2 's strategy for the fall \uc2 election\uc2  incorrectly said Mr. Roe was Mr. Cruz's pollster.\par \par \uc2 (WSJ July 27, 2016)\par \par \uc2 (END)\par \par \uc2 CLEVELAND -- Republican \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2 's fall campaign will test whether the most unconventional major-party presidential nominee in generations can cut an unconventional path to the White House.\par \par \uc2 He aims to outmaneuver Democratic rival \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  by capturing a handful of states in the Rust Belt and the Northeast that typically favor Democrats, with an appeal to less-educated, working-class voters.\par \par \uc2 But the New York businessman leaves the convention here with the most negative public image of any nominee in modern history, particularly among minority voters, according to recent polls, and with many Republicans still hesitant to accept him as their standard bearer.\par \par \uc2 Those headwinds to winning the 270 electoral votes needed to claim the presidency are particularly strong in some of the country's more racially and ethnically diverse swing states, polling shows, including Colorado and Virginia, where Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  leads.\par \par \uc2 Her image, though, is nearly as tarnished as Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's, and the convention here made it clear that Republicans want to make her the focus of the race. Most of the speakers dwelled on her perceived failings, often to chants of "lock her up.""\par \par \uc2 In addition, the landscape could change drastically before \uc2 Election\uc2  Day, when the conventions will be a distant memory and Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  will have squared off with Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  in three fall debates. Republican George H.W. Bush, for example, surged past Michael Dukakis in the fall of 1988.\par \par \uc2 Advisers to Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  point to Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin as states where he can outperform past GOP nominees, though the three states haven't voted Republican in a presidential race since at least 1988.\par \par \uc2 His team is casting an even wider net, suggesting that Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  can compete in the solidly blue states of Connecticut, New Jersey and Oregon. "I'm not saying we're going to win, but we're going to put them into play," said Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  Jr., one of the candidate's sons, at a breakfast this week hosted by the The Wall Street Journal.\par \par \uc2 From the campaign's outset, the Electoral College math has favored Democrats, with Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  needing to win 64 more electoral votes than Republican \uc2 Mitt Romney\uc2  won in 2012.\par \par \uc2 Still, when the race began last year, the political environment seemed to be tipping in Republicans' favor. Voters were eager for change, and it had been more than a decade since the share of Americans who thought the country was on the right track outpaced those who thought it was on the wrong track.\par \par \uc2 That hasn't changed, and yet Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  still leads nationally, according to Wall Street Journal/NBC News polling throughout this year.\par \par \uc2 The early polling doesn't paint a rosy scenario for Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  in traditional battlegrounds. Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  leads all seven states for which Real Clear Politics has aggregated polling. She also outpaced Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  in six of the seven states where the Journal, NBC News and Marist surveyed voters. That included Florida, the nation's largest swing state. The two were tied in Ohio, which is hosting the GOP convention.\par \par \uc2 "This should be a very close race, with a slight edge to the Republicans," said Democratic pollster Mark Mellman. "It's the first time we've had two candidates this disliked, but what matters is the difference between them -- he's more disliked than she is."\par \par \uc2 Overall, the 2016 White House race has revealed the same stark racial and educational divide that defined the electorate four years ago. Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's leads among African-Americans and Hispanics resemble President \uc2 Barack Obama\uc2 's support in 2012, while Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  leads by 14 percentage points among whites. Mr. Romney won white voters by 20 percentage points in 2012, according to exit polls.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  notched a sizable 55%-33% lead among white voters who don't have four-year college degrees, according to July's Journal/NBC News survey. But he essentially tied Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  in the poll among white voters who do have degrees. Republicans tend to run stronger with these voters. The split along lines of educational attainment is a big reason Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  is outpacing earlier GOP candidates in whiter, working-class communities, pollsters say, and why Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  is doing better in well-educated suburbs.\par \par \uc2 "\uc2 Trump\uc2  has made the party more the party of the worker," said GOP pollster Kellyanne Conway, who recently joined his campaign, at an event sponsored by the Atlantic.\par \par \uc2 There are some bright spots for the Republican in many of the states Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  needs to win in November.\par \par \uc2 Jeff Roe, the pollster for Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, identified bellwether counties in seven battlegrounds that have correctly predicted the statewide outcome in each of the last four elections. Entering the convention, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  had the lead in six -- in Florida, North Carolina, Colorado, Nevada, Ohio and Pennsylvania. Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  posted her only advantage in Loudon County, Va.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  spent far less than his Republican rivals to win the primary, and he may have to defy convention again to have a good shot at winning the general \uc2 election\uc2 , given the large sums that presidential candidates have spent to win.\par \par \uc2 The Republican ended June with $20 million in the bank, according to \uc2 Federal \uc2 Election\uc2  Commission\uc2  data, after raising $26 million for his campaign and $32 million for the party. Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  ended the month with $44 million in the bank, having raised $40 million in June for her campaign and $81 million for the party.\par \par \uc2 That financial advantage has translated into a big edge in television advertising. Since May 1, the \uc2 Clinton\uc2  campaign has spent more than $31 million on TV ads in nine states, according to Kantar Media. The \uc2 Trump\uc2  campaign hadn't spent a dime in that period.\par \par \uc2 Given both candidates' uniquely negative images, operatives in both parties are already predicting historically low turnout, increasing the importance of party unity for both candidates. Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  may still have work to do after a nasty spat with GOP rival Mr. Cruz.\par \par \uc2 "It does matter, if you don't have unity for a party coming out of a convention," said Chris Wilson, a pollster for Mr. Cruz, who was booed Wednesday night for refusing to endorse the nominee. "That's a big problem we have."\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=wjco20160722000140"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document J000000020160722ec7m0003l\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw272\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4080\pichgoal600

\par\par \b \uc2 The Republican Convention: Lobbyists Stay on Sidelines\b0\par\par\uc2 By Rebecca Ballhaus   \par \uc2 625 \uc2 words\par \uc2 22 July 2016\par \uc2 The Wall Street Journal\par \uc2 J\par A5\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 Corrections & Amplifications\par \par \uc2 Cleveland is on the shore of Lake Erie. A U.S. News article Friday about lobbyists and the Republican convention incorrectly said a lobbyist thought hosting a fundraiser on the Ohio River could have raised money at the convention.\par \par \uc2 (WSJ July 26, 2016)\par \par \uc2 (END)\par \par \uc2 CLEVELAND -- Tucked in a coffee shop that offered a brief reprieve from throngs of police and "Make America Great Again" hat vendors, Republican lobbyist Matthew Johnson sipped an iced coffee as he thought about his answer.\par \par \uc2 The question: Whether he would vote for GOP nominee \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  in November.\par \par \uc2 After several minutes, Mr. Johnson, a former chief counsel to Texas Sen. John Cornyn who now works at the \uc2 Podesta Group\uc2 , one of Washington's largest lobbying firms, gave a carefully crafted response.\par \par \uc2 "I'm a Republican and I vote for Republicans," he said. "But I'd want to see some moderation on issues like immigration and trade, and more openness to entitlement reform, before I go all-in with \uc2 Trump\uc2 ."\par \par \uc2 Mr. Johnson's struggle to answer the question illustrates the predicament in which many lobbyists found themselves at this week's Republican convention: how to make the most of an event dedicated to feting the party's newly minted nominee, while trying to avoid any mention of him.\par \par \uc2 After Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  spent months railing against lobbyists and the special interests they represent, many lobbyists opted out of the convention, both because they haven't been tapped to raise money for the campaign and because some of their clients had hesitated to fund a convention with Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  at the top of the ticket. Those concerns left the Cleveland host committee with a funding gap of $6 million at the end of last week.\par \par \uc2 They have also historically acted as a substantial fundraising source for presidential candidates, both by donating large sums and recruiting their vast networks to do the same. Lobbyists raised at least $17 million for Republican nominee \uc2 Mitt Romney\uc2  in 2012.\par \par \uc2 So far in the 2016 race, registered lobbyists haven't raised a cent for Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , according to \uc2 Federal \uc2 Election\uc2  Commission\uc2  disclosures covering the period through June. They have raised $7 million in that period for Democrat \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Lobbyists typically spend convention weeks hobnobbing with clients, party-hopping and enjoying the perks that presidential candidates provide for their top fundraisers, including elaborate suites at the convention center and box seats at the arena.\par \par \uc2 This year, the events were fewer and more sparsely attended. Premium seats in the arena were reserved for top fundraisers for Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's joint fund with the \uc2 Republican National Committee\uc2 , \uc2 Trump\uc2  Victory, which also hasn't reported any fundraising from registered lobbyists.\par \par \uc2 Cleveland would have been a prime location for major money events, such as inviting donors aboard a yacht on the Ohio River, said David Beightol, a partner at a government affairs firm in Washington, D.C., who raised $1.6 million for Mr. Romney in 2012. Neither he nor his firm are hosting any events this week.\par \par \uc2 After mulling his answer on how he planned to vote, Mr. Johnson headed to his next event, a \uc2 Politico\uc2  forum called "Energy and the \uc2 Election\uc2 ."\par \par \uc2 He chuckled as panelists, including a lobbyist for the \uc2 U.S. Chamber of Commerce\uc2 , struggled to answer the same question: To back Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  or not.\par \par \uc2 In the end, one panelist -- a state finance chairman for Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  -- said he would support the nominee, and another said he wouldn't. The other two didn't answer the question.\par \par \uc2 Ultimately, Mr. Johnson didn't either. For now, he said, he is focusing on keeping Republican control of the Senate.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=wjco20160722000105"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document J000000020160722ec7m0002m\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

Mark Rylance is very good as the melancholy, steadfast title character, whose relationship with a little girl named Sophie (Ruby Barnhill) propels an episodic, slightly tedious narrative. (A. O. Scott)\par \par \uc2 'Caf\u233\'00\'E9 Society' (PG-13, 1:36) Woody Allen wanders back into the worlds of 1930s Hollywood and New York, patching together an intermittently amusing, visually elegant collage of familiar themes. Steve Carell is a powerful movie agent, Jesse Eisenberg is his ambitious nephew from the Bronx, and Kristen Stewart is the young woman they both love. She's too good for either one of them, and also for this tired movie. (Scott)\par \par \uc2 'Captain America: Civil War' (PG-13, 2:27) More of a collegial misunderstanding, really, but this episode in the lavish workplace sitcom known as the Marvel Cinematic Universe, in which the Captain (Chris Evans) and Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.) quarrel about United Nations policy, does have some amusing banter and a few entertaining superhero brawls. (Scott)\par \par \uc2 \u9733\'26\'05 'Captain Fantastic' (R, 1:59) Viggo Mortensen stars in this pleasurably freewheeling movie about a young family who leave the radical isolation of their Oregon home and go back on the grid. The writer-director Matt Ross takes both his characters and his audience seriously. (Manohla Dargis)\par \par \uc2 'Central Intelligence' (PG-13, 1:54) Reuniting two former high school acquaintances (Kevin Hart and Dwayne Johnson) for an odd-couple caper of staggering dopiness, the director Rawson Marshall Thurber creates a clean-out-the-fridge soup of celebrity cameos and C.I.A. confusion. (Jeannette Catsoulis)\par \par \uc2 'Cold War 2' (No rating, 1:50, in Cantonese) This follow-up to the 2012 Hong Kong crime film ''Cold War'' may be incomprehensible for those unfamiliar with the original, but it is a summer sequel worth its salt, a brisk exercise in suspense and high-gloss mayhem. (Ben Kenigsberg)\par \par \uc2 \u9733\'26\'05 'The Conjuring 2' (R, 2:14) This worthy sequel reunites Vera Farmiga and Patrick Wilson as the real-life paranormal investigators Lorraine and Ed Warren. This time they're looking into mysterious goings-on in a house in London. James Wan again directs and serves up some good scares, and a youngster named Madison Wolfe gives an attention-getting performance as a possessed child. (Neil Genzlinger)\par \par \uc2 \u9733\'26\'05 'Dheepan' (R, 1:49, in French) A former Tamil Tiger militant finds asylum in a French housing project in this film by Jacques Audiard (''Rust and Bone,'' ''A Prophet''), which is both an exercise in topical realism and a tense, western-tinged action drama. (Scott)\par \par \uc2 \u9733\'26\'05 'Don't Blink -- Robert Frank' (No rating, 1:22) An affectionate portrait of this prolific photographer (''The Americans'') and filmmaker (''Pull My Daisy''), still active and irascible in his 90s. (Scott)\par \par \uc2 \u9733\'26\'05 'Eat That Question: Frank Zappa in His Own Words' (R, 1:30) This documentary about the iconoclastic rock musician and composer Frank Zappa is rich in clips in which various interviewers try in vain to fit him into boxes that they learned about in journalism school. It's a delightful portrait of the man and his work that also serves as a snapshot of the cultural clashes of his times. (Genzlinger)\par \par \uc2 'Equals' (PG-13, 1:41) Kristen Stewart, the movies' sullen ''it girl'' of the moment, and Nicholas Hoult, a pretty boy made to look zombielike in ''Mad Max: Fury Road,'' play futuristic lovers in ''Equals,'' a dystopian sci-fi snooze that suffers from imagination deficit disorder. (Stephen Holden)\par \par \uc2 \u9733\'26\'05 'Finding Dory' (PG, 1:43) While it lacks the technical dazzle and emotional sweep of ''Finding Nemo'' and other \uc2 Pixar\uc2  masterpieces, this sequel, with Ellen DeGeneres as the voice of an absent-minded blue tang, is a warm, lively and inclusive piece of summer entertainment. Ed O'Neill almost runs away with it as a grumpy, helpful seven-armed octopus named Hank. (Scott)\par \par \uc2 'Ghostbusters' (PG-13, 1:36) Kate McKinnon's magnificent, eccentric turn embodies Paul Feig's reboot at its best. Girls rule; women are funny; get over it. With Leslie Jones, Melissa McCarthy and Kristen Wiig. (Dargis)\par \par \uc2 \u9733\'26\'05 'Hunt for the Wilderpeople' (PG-13, 1:41) In this charming, funny movie about a lost kid and a crusty geezer (a perfect Sam Neill), the New Zealander director Taika Waititi takes some familiar story types and strips them of clich\u233\'00\'E9. (Dargis)\par \par \uc2 'Independence Day: Resurgence' (PG-13, 1:59) No. (Dargis)\par \par \uc2 \u9733\'26\'05 'The Infiltrator' (R, 2:07) In some ways, Bryan Cranston's character in ''The Infiltrator'' is an alternate version of Walter White, the good-guy-turned-rotten he portrayed so magnetically in ''Breaking Bad.'' This seedy, drug-soaked thriller is based on a memoir by \uc2 Robert Mazur\uc2  (Mr. Cranston), an undercover cop who in 1986 posed as a high-rolling money launderer in a sting operation against Pablo Escobar's Colombian drug cartel. Unlike Walter, Robert is a good guy who remains good when faced with temptation. (Holden)\par \par \uc2 \u9733\'26\'05 'The Innocents' (PG-13, 1:55, in French and Polish) Much of Anne Fontaine's blistering film, set within the walls of a Polish convent in December 1945, just after the end of World War II, is based on true events recalled by a French doctor (Lou de La\u226\'00\'E2ge) stationed at a nearby Red Cross hospital. Summoned to the convent, she discovers pregnant nuns who were serially raped by Soviet soldiers and supervises the deliveries of their babies. Until its too soft ending, ''The Innocents'' is a hair-raising evocation of unspeakable barbarity. (Holden)\par \par \uc2 \u9733\'26\'05 'The Kind Words' (No rating, 1:58) When a mother dies, taking with her the truth about her past, her three grown children are left to challenge their definitions of family, identity and ethnicity in this film, in French and Hebrew, by the Israeli director Shemi Zarhin. (Helen T. Verongos)\par \par \uc2 'The Legend of Tarzan' (PG-13, 1:49) The filmmakers behind this enjoyable romp have given Tarzan (Alexander Skarsgard) a thoughtful, imperfect makeover, which must have been tough, given the origin story's white supremacy problems. Samuel L. Jackson co-stars as a crusader based on a real human rights activist. (Dargis)\par \par \uc2 'Life, Animated' (PG, 1:29) Like the \uc2 Disney\uc2  movie clips that flood its frames, Roger Ross Williams's too-tentative documentary about Owen Suskind, an autistic young man who learned to communicate through cartoon characters, is relentlessly upbeat and frustratingly restrictive. (Catsoulis)\par \par \uc2 \u9733\'26\'05 'The Lobster' (R, 1:59) Colin Farrell and Rachel Weisz star in Yorgos Lanthimos's mordant allegory of managed emotion and mandatory monogamy, set in a chilly, plausibly cruel imaginary world. (Scott)\par \par \uc2 \u9733\'26\'05 'Love & Friendship' (PG, 1:32) Whit Stillman takes a minor Jane Austen work and whips it up into a sharp, silly farce, starring Kate Beckinsale as Lady Susan Vernon, a Regency schemer on the prowl for money and husbands, some of whom already have wives. (Scott)\par \par \uc2 \u9733\'26\'05 'Maggie's Plan' (R, 1:38) \uc2 Rebecca Miller\uc2 's new film is a sharp, genial comedy about Maggie, a young New Yorker (Greta Gerwig) who falls in love and starts a family with an older man (Ethan Hawke), after which things get complicated. Ms. Miller's ear for emotional foibles is acute, and the cast is in good form, in particular Julianne Moore as Maggie's rival, a Danish professor. (Scott)\par \par \uc2 'The Man Who Knew Infinity' (PG-13, 1:48) Dev Patel (the ''Best Exotic Marigold Hotel'' movies) plays yet another earnest, well-meaning character in this portrait of the early-20th-century mathematician Srinivasa Ramanujan, who was mentored by the Cambridge professor G. H. Hardy (Jeremy Irons) and surmounted racism to become the first Indian to hold a fellowship at Trinity College. The film is tidy, handsome and, yes, earnest. (Andy Webster)\par \par \uc2 'Me Before You' (PG-13, 1:51) In this preposterous weepie, Emilia Clark plays Lou, a quirky free spirit who takes a job caring for Will (Sam Claflin), an imperious quadriplegic aristocrat. If you reread the previous sentence three or four times you will figure out everything that happens in this movie, and spare yourself the chore of seeing it. (Scott)\par \par \uc2 'Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates' (R, 1:45) Two idiots need dates; they get them. (Dargis)\par \par \uc2 'The Neon Demon' (R, 1:57) A derivative, ostentatious quasi-horror movie about an aspiring fashion model (Elle Fanning) and the extreme resentment she engenders. Directed by Nicolas Winding Refn, with his tongue hanging out of his mouth, probably. (Glenn Kenny)\par \par \uc2 \u9733\'26\'05 'Norman Lear: Just Another Version of You' (No rating, 1:32) There are lessons about creativity and longevity in this assured documentary portrait by Heidi Ewing and Rachel Grady of Mr. Lear, the influential and socially minded 1970s sitcom producer. In struggles between Mr. Lear and Esther Rolle -- the ''Good Times'' star who took umbrage at the show's tag line, ''Dy-no-mite!'' -- we are reminded that effective topical entertainment rarely comes without conflict. But then, do you know how hard it is ''to make people laugh, to tackle big issues and get big ratings?'' asks Amy Poehler, a Lear admirer. ''It's so hard that people don't do it anymore.'' (Webster)\par \par \uc2 'Now You See Me 2' (PG-13, 2:09) Everything is supersized and preposterous in this illusion-theme sequel (directed by Jon M. Chu), as the so-called Four Horsemen, bouncing from one stupendously slick stunt to another, steal a tech doodad that can control all the world's computers. (Catsoulis)\par \par \uc2 'Our Kind of Traitor' (R, 1:47) In this adaptation of the 2010 John le Carr\u233\'00\'E9 novel, Ewan McGregor and Naomie Harris play a couple who are improbably swept up in an intrigue involving the Russian mob and British intelligence. Stellan Skarsgard steals the show. (Dargis)\par \par \uc2 \u9733\'26\'05 'Our Little Sister' (PG, 2:08, in Japanese) Adapted from a popular Japanese graphic novel, this new film by Hirokazu Kore-eda is a gentle tale of sisterly devotion with a surprisingly powerful emotional kick. (Scott)\par \par \uc2 'Phantom Boy' (PG, 1:24) An attractively designed but conceptually and emotionally piddling French animated film from the makers of ''A Cat in Paris'' concerns the adventures of a sickly adolescent New York boy who can travel outside his physical body, the better to observe nefarious criminals and their evil schemes against the city. (Kenny)\par \par \uc2 'The Purge: \uc2 Election\uc2  Year' (R, 1:43) Twelve more hours of unbridled killing from this overachieving low-budget franchise, this time with some interesting, if not terribly well-developed, political overtones. (Scott)\par \par \uc2 'The Secret Life of Pets' (PG, 1:26) From the studio that unleashed the Minions on the world, this talking-animal, celebrity-voiced animated caper falls somewhere in the middle of the spectrum between cat's meow and utter dog. (Scott)\par \par \uc2 'The Shallows' (PG-13, 1:27) A healthy, confident surfer (Blake Lively) treks to an awesome beach in Mexico only to learn that a gigantic and tetchy shark likes to dine there. Chomping, frantic swimming and self-surgery ensue. (Kenny)\par \par \uc2 \u9733\'26\'05 'Swiss Army Man' (R, 1:35) This stunningly original mix of the macabre and the magical follows a lonely castaway (Paul Dano) and a flatulent corpse (Daniel Radcliffe) into a weird and wonderful story of effluvial enchantment that's beholden to no rules but its own. (Catsoulis)\par \par \uc2 'Under the Sun' (No rating, 1:47, in Korean) A startling look at daily life in North Korea, captured by a Russian filmmaker whose finished film turns the tables on the government officials who tried to oversee his work. (Kenny)\par \par \uc2 \u9733\'26\'05 'The Wailing' (No rating, 2:36) The audacious Korean director Na Hong-jin's new movie is an expansive and sometimes excruciating horror tale. Xenophobia and possible demonic possession are among several story ingredients that boil up to a terrifying brew over the movie's two-hour-plus running time. (Kenny)\par \par \uc2 \u9733\'26\'05 'Weiner' (R, 1:40) ''What's wrong with you?'' That question, posed to the disgraced New York City mayoral candidate Anthony Weiner in the infuriating and depressing but rivetingly watchable documentary that bears his name, is never answered and only barely addressed in the film directed by Josh Kriegman (a former Weiner aide) and Elyse Steinberg. As almost everyone knows, Mr. Weiner's meteoric political career was ended -- or at least interrupted -- by a sexting scandal in which Mr. Weiner flirted with and exhibited himself to women online. The movie is also the portrait of a marriage in disarray. His wife, Huma Abedin, a trusted assistant to Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , is present in much of the film, ready to stand by her man but clearly unhappy. (Holden)\par \par \uc2 \u9733\'26\'05 'The Witness' (No rating, 1:29) The 1964 murder of Catherine Genovese, called Kitty, in Queens caused international outrage after a \uc2 New York Times\uc2  front-page article said 38 people had witnessed her murder and failed to act. This seamless documentary traces the yearslong efforts of Ms. Genovese's brother Bill to get to the bottom of what actually happened. Not merely a ''Rashomon''-like account of events, the film is also a compelling portrait of a man striving to come to grips with loss. (Webster)\par \par \uc2 'X-Men: Apocalypse' (PG-13, 2:23) A mutant from ancient Egypt awakens in the early 1980s and seeks out some latter-day mutants as end-of-the-world adjuncts; Professor Charles Xavier and his acolytes try to stave off, you know, apocalypse. The filmmaking is sometimes witty, while the emphasis on potential mass death is unimaginative and rote. (Kenny)\par \par \uc2 Film Series\par \par \uc2 Cassavetes/Rowlands (through Sunday) The title of the Metrograph's John Cassavetes retrospective acknowledges the immeasurable influence of the filmmaker's wife, muse and close collaborator, Gena Rowlands, on a body of work that is attuned like no other to the ways that couples interact. Ms. Rowlands's most memorable performances include her work as an unstable housewife in ''A Woman Under the Influence''; as an actress whose life on- and offstage is affected after a fan's accidental death, in ''Opening Night''; and as one half of an odd couple in ''Minnie and Moskowitz'' (Saturday), a romantic comedy in which she and Seymour Cassel share an affection comprehensible only to them. It may be the best Cassavetes-for-beginners movie. 7 Ludlow Street, Lower East Side, 212-660-0312, metrograph.com. (Kenigsberg)\par \par \uc2 Eternity and History: The Cinema of Theo Angelopoulos (through Sunday) The pre-eminent Greek filmmaker Theo Angelopoulos, who died suddenly in 2012 after being struck by a motorcycle, often seemed to direct his movies from Olympian heights. Full of complicated tracking shots, slow pacing and abstruse references, his films address only the most committed viewers. Mr. Angelopoulos's ''Eternity and a Day,'' which won the top prize at the 1998 Cannes Film Festival, will be shown Sunday at 3 p.m. Museum of the Moving Image, 35th Avenue at 37th Street, Astoria, Queens, 718-784-0077, movingimage.us. (Kenigsberg)\par \par \uc2 Four More Years: An \uc2 Election\uc2  Special (through Aug. 3) Just in time for the 2016 party conventions, the \uc2 Brooklyn Academy of Music\uc2  has compiled a grab bag of movies that use elections either as a backdrop (''The Manchurian Candidate,'' ''All the President's Men,'' ''Nashville'') or as a focus (''Primary,'' ''The War Room''); they span the eras from Capra to \uc2 Clinton\uc2  and a bit beyond. And with a mix of documentaries and fiction, the program makes ample room for paranoia, pageantry and comedy. (The Museum of the Moving Image is hosting a nearly simultaneous series, ''On the Campaign Trail,'' centered on \uc2 election\uc2  documentaries and mockumentaries.) BAM Rose Cinemas, 30 Lafayette Avenue, at Ashland Place, Fort Greene, Brooklyn, 718-636-4100, bam.org. (Kenigsberg)\par \par \uc2 Gaumont\uc2 : Cin\u233\'00\'E9ma Pour Tout le Monde (Wednesday through Sept. 7) The \uc2 Gaumont\uc2  studio is one of the great constants of French cinema, as dependable as the Eiffel Tower or steak frites. Although this series celebrates the production company's 120-year history with some favorites from the canon -- including Max Oph\u252\'00\'FCls's ''The Earrings of Madame de ...'' (July 30 and Aug. 3) -- it makes room for titles that are relatively disreputable or ripe for reappraisal, such as Joseph Losey's 1982 feature, ''The Trout'' (Aug. 11 and 13), starring a young Isabelle Huppert in a role originally intended for Brigitte Bardot. It also showcases the company's continuing importance with newer films like M\u233\'00\'E9lanie Laurent's 2014 ''Breathe'' (Aug. 17 and 21), a chronicle of a teenage friendship that turns obsessive and suffocating. Museum of Modern Art Roy and Niuta Titus Theaters, 11 West 53rd Street, 212-708-9400, moma.org. (Kenigsberg)\par \par \uc2 Japan Cuts: Festival of New Japanese Film (through Sunday) The 10th edition of this annual festival of Japanese cinema focuses largely on new films, including ''The Whispering Star,'' a science-fiction drama from the prolific director Sion Sono (''Love Exposure''). His career is examined in a documentary, ''The Sion Sono.'' But the 29-feature lineup also showcases some older work, like ''Burst City'' (Saturday), from 1982, billed as an heir to ''Mad Max'' and as a cornerstone of Japan's cyberpunk movement. \uc2 Japan Society\uc2 , 333 East 47th Street, Manhattan, 212-715-1258, japansociety.org. (Kenigsberg)\par \par \uc2 Les Durs (through Aug. 2) France's biggest toughs have been the source of some of Film Forum's biggest box office successes, so it's no surprise that the theater is dedicating a summer series to three actors who specialized in playing gangsters and stoics. The stars in question are Jean Gabin, the poetic leading man of Jean Renoir's ''Grand Illusion'' (Saturday and Wednesday); Lino Ventura, who played a resistance fighter in Jean-Pierre Melville's ''Army of Shadows'' (Wednesday); and Jean-Paul Belmondo, who kicked off the program with his turns in Jean-Luc Godard's ''Breathless'' and Melville's wonderfully labyrinthine ''Le Doulos.'' 209 West Houston Street, west of Avenue of the Americas, South Village, 212-727-8110, filmforum.org. (Kenigsberg)\par \par \uc2 Mondo Mondo (through July 31) This retrospective celebrates the influence of the 1962 ethnographic documentary ''Mondo Cane'' (Friday and next Saturday), called an antidocumentary or shockumentary by its makers. An opening disclaimer observes that it's not the journalist's job to shy away from cruelty, and the movie's reason for being is to compile bizarre and horrifying sights from around the globe. In the filmmakers' estimation, these include the mating rituals of various South Pacific islanders; birds and turtles on the Marshall Islands whose life cycles have been scrambled by radioactivity; sharks that have grown accustomed to eating human flesh, thanks to an underwater cemetery; and a New York City restaurant whose patrons, some coifed like Jacqueline Kennedy, dine on beetles, muskrats and worms. Dog lovers in particular should be warned that they will never un-see what's shown there, but the film remains fascinating for its sensationalism, its possible staging and the sarcastic counterpoint of its voice-over. The series also includes ''Mondo Topless'' (Saturday and Thursday), Russ Meyer's nudie-movie takeoff on the genre, and other films that grew out of the Mondo shock aesthetic, like ''Cannibal Holocaust'' (Monday and July 30). Anthology Film Archives, 32 Second Avenue, at Second Street, East Village, 212-505-5181, anthologyfilmarchives.org. (Kenigsberg)\par \par \uc2 Outdoor Cinema 2016 at Socrates Sculpture Park (Wednesdays) In a field trip from its usual Houston Street location, Film Forum has selected six titles to contribute to Socrates Sculpture Park's annual outdoor movie series. (Rooftop Films, which programs outdoor movies across the city, contributed two more.) The selections all have a river theme, an apparent nod to the park's location on the East River. The water in most of the films is probably better for swimming, although Humphrey Bogart does have an encounter with leeches in ''The African Queen,'' which opened the program. Subsequent voyages will take parkgoers to Shanghai (''Suzhou River,'' Aug. 10) and the Amazon region (''Aguirre, the Wrath of God,'' Aug. 17, and the recent Oscar nominee ''Embrace of the Serpent,'' Aug. 24). Vernon Boulevard and Broadway, Long Island City, Queens, 718-956-1819, socratessculpturepark.org. (Kenigsberg)\par \par \uc2 'Pootie Tang' (Friday and Saturday) When ''Pootie Tang'' opened in 2001, the FX series ''Louie'' was still nearly a decade away. Its creator, Louis C.K., had directed only one other feature, the barely released ''Tomorrow Night.'' And in what seemed like an unlikely confluence of circumstances even then, he had the opportunity to extend a sketch he had worked on at ''The Chris Rock Show'' into what, once the notoriously long end credits are taken into account, technically qualifies as a feature film. It stars Lance Crouther as a combination street fighter and recording artist who speaks in inscrutable catchphrases; the cinematography is by Willy Kurant, a former collaborator of Orson Welles and Jean-Luc Godard. Although Louis C.K. has expressed displeasure with the cut that reached theaters, the shambles today endures as a spectacle of go-for-broke randomness, with the potential to prompt dissertations from pop-culture historians, cinema-studies majors and perhaps linguistics Ph.D.s.

\par\par \uc2 National Desk; SECTA\par \b \uc2 Cruz Gambled on Redefining 2020 Race, but Critics See Betrayal\b0\par\par\uc2 By JENNIFER STEINHAUER and MATT FLEGENHEIMER; Maggie Haberman and Jonathan Martin contributed reporting. \par \uc2 1,594 \uc2 words\par \uc2 22 July 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 11\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 CORRECTION APPENDEDCLEVELAND -- Senator Ted Cruz of Texas did not come here this week to unite Republicans around their presidential nominee, \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2 . Armed with his usual arsenal of florid oratory, self-regard and blunt force, he came instead to rally them, someday, around Ted Cruz.\par \par \uc2 He failed, at least for the moment. And in the process, he managed to do the unthinkable -- make Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  look like a victim.\par \par \uc2 Determined to be more than just another speaker and looking beyond the November \uc2 election\uc2 , Mr. Cruz worked with aides for weeks to fashion a speech that they hoped would define him beyond his failed 2016 quest for the White House and advance his image beyond Tea Party upstart to a modern version of his idol, Ronald Reagan.\par \par \uc2 He offered lofty paeans on Wednesday to an America that included gays and atheists and where heroism was displayed not just by service members fighting terrorism on the front lines but also by the forgiving families of those killed last year at the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston, S.C. He spoke to a broader audience of Americans that many have accused Republicans of ignoring.\par \par \uc2 But then he twisted the knife in Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's back, suggesting that the leadership of that America should not fall to the man his party had come to nominate.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Cruz is clearly gambling that Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  is likely to lose, perhaps embarrassingly, and that when he does Mr. Cruz will emerge as the strongest spokesman for the Republican Party's core conservative principles. As the only contender to even put a dent in Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's support, and with a fully operational campaign apparatus still in place, he may be the best positioned out of the gate in 2020.\par \par \uc2 But for now, it appears that Mr. Cruz's raw ambition -- which fueled his audacious 2012 Senate primary victory over his state's lieutenant governor, the disastrous government shutdown he led a year later and his subsequent attacks on the Republicans who did not support it -- has backfired.\par \par \uc2 In the cold light of morning Thursday, Mr. Cruz found himself facing down furious delegates from his own state at a public breakfast, who told him he needed to back Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  now.\par \par \uc2 ''Do it!'' one shouted during a blistering 25-minute question-and-answer session. ''Do it now!'' Mr. Cruz resisted in his usual manner, saying he refused to be a ''servile puppy dog.'' He put the blame for his disloyalty on Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's repeated attacks on his family during the primaries.\par \par \uc2 Former admirers and his congressional colleagues took to television to criticize him, at times with profane language, the way his Senate colleagues have been doing for years behind closed doors. ''Lucifer is back,'' cracked the former House speaker, \uc2 John A. Boehner\uc2 , who was watching the convention with his wife and friends, according to an aide.\par \par \uc2 ''He really betrayed what our mission is here, which is to win in November,'' said Nicholas A. Langworthy, a delegate from New York and chairman of the Erie County party, who helped lead the chorus of boos that followed Mr. Cruz off the stage. ''He should just go back to Texas,'' Mr. Langworthy said. ''He slit his own throat. He is finished in national Republican politics.''\par \par \uc2 Representative Charlie Dent, a Pennsylvania Republican who has himself been critical of Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , had harsh words for Mr. Cruz after his Wednesday remarks.\par \par \uc2 ''Senator's Cruz's opposition is not based in principle but entirely personal, which is interesting given his sniveling, obsequious and fawning defense of \uc2 Trump\uc2  early in the primary campaign,'' Mr. Dent said. ''I suspect many Americans learned a lot about Ted Cruz last night and now better understand why so many in Congress harbor bitter feelings toward the junior senator from Texas.''\par \par \uc2 Hours before Mr. Cruz's highly anticipated speech on Wednesday evening, his former campaign manager, Jeff Roe, received a call from Jason Miller, a former Cruz aide now advising Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 . Mr. Miller informed the Cruz team that ''Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  would really appreciate'' and ''would remember it'' if Mr. Cruz endorsed him in the speech, Mr. Roe said. ''I hear you,'' Mr. Roe told him.\par \par \uc2 When the speech was sent out a short while later, nothing had changed: There was still no endorsement.\par \par \uc2 As Mr. Cruz prepared to address supporters at an outdoor bar that afternoon, Mr. Roe suggested that the \uc2 Trump\uc2  campaign would have little to object to. ''I think they'll be pleased with the speech,'' he told reporters, interrupting his news conference briefly when a call from \uc2 Paul Manafort\uc2 , the \uc2 Trump\uc2  campaign chairman, came in. Mr. Roe was asked if Mr. Cruz's speech would focus more on himself than on Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 . ''Self-aggrandizing is not really his shtick,'' Mr. Roe said to the reporters.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's aides were provided with a copy of Mr. Cruz's remarks two hours before he gave them, both sides said, and were then outraged to see that not only would Mr. Cruz not endorse Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , but that he would suggest pointedly that Republicans should feel no obligation to vote for Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  and his aides briefly considered bumping Mr. Cruz from the lineup, but quickly concluded that that would bring more controversy to a convention that had been battered enough. Mr. Cruz and Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  expected the speech to generate an angry reaction, but both sides were unprepared for its intensity.\par \par \uc2 As Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's children looked on in silence, Mr. Cruz read from a teleprompter, at first in lofty phrases that referred to the civil rights movement, the killing of police officers in recent weeks and one victim of a police shooting. He spoke of the inherent constitutional rights of all Americans, including gays and atheists.\par \par \uc2 But when Mr. Cruz used the code phrase ''vote your conscience'' -- which in congressional terms means go against your leaders -- he was met with boisterous boos and hisses from the crowd, led by the New York delegation a few feet away. One delegate said that some people on the floor were reduced to tears because of their disappointment and fury.\par \par \uc2 Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader, sat watching the speeches from a skybox in the arena, realizing that prime time America was now watching an ''Apprentice'' style version of what he and his Republican colleagues had suffered through on the Senate floor, where Mr. Cruz once called him a liar.\par \par \uc2 House Speaker Paul D. Ryan was backstage with \uc2 Mike Pence\uc2 , the governor of Indiana, whom he would soon introduce as the Republican nominee for vice president, whose appropriate but mild remarks would be completely overshadowed by Mr. Cruz's spectacle.\par \par \uc2 As Mr. Cruz slunk from the stage and Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's son Eric took the lectern, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's aides sought out \uc2 Newt Gingrich\uc2 , the former House speaker, who was slated to speak after Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's son.\par \par \uc2 ''I don't think they realized how strong the reaction was going to be,'' Mr. Gingrich said. ''They came to me and said: 'We need to get closure here. Let's talk it through.' ''\par \par \uc2 They decided Mr. Gingrich would rebut Mr. Cruz by directly praising Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 . ''I sat down with the senior editor of the teleprompter while Eric was speaking, and over those 12 minutes they were able to reload my remarks,'' Mr. Gingrich said.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Cruz tried to repair to the luxury convention suite of the Las Vegas casino magnate and Republican donor \uc2 Sheldon Adelson\uc2 , but he was turned away like a freshman tossed out of a senior keg party. \uc2 Andy Abboud\uc2 , a top aide to Mr. Adelson, told Mr. Cruz he was not welcome there, according to two people in the suite who witnessed the exchange.\par \par \uc2 ''Nobody's ever done in America,'' Mr. Gingrich said. (He should know.) Mr. Cruz clearly agrees. After his dismissal from Mr. Adelson's event, Mr. Cruz found a friendlier face. He went directly to the Ritz a few blocks away for drinks with Andrew F. Puzder, the California-based chief executive of Hardee's and Carl's Jr. and a major Republican donor who raised cash for Mr. Cruz's campaign.\par \par \uc2 Before long, Mr. Roe said, Mr. Cruz retired to his hotel room, keeping a lingering eye on his \uc2 Twitter\uc2  feed. After 1 a.m., a fund-raising email for his Senate campaign flooded email inboxes. Subject line: ''Our fight goes on.''\par \par \uc2 Find out what you need to know about the 2016 presidential race today, and get politics news updates via \uc2 Facebook\uc2 , \uc2 Twitter\uc2  and the First Draft newsletter.\par \par \uc2 Correction: July 23, 2016, Saturday\par \par \uc2 This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article on Friday about reaction to a speech by Senator Ted Cruz of Texas at the Republican National Convention misstated, in some copies, the surname of the chief executive of the parent company of Hardee's and Carl's Jr. restaurants, who raised money for Mr. Cruz's campaign. He is Andrew F. Puzder, not Pudzer.\par \par \uc2 Above and left, Ted Cruz spoke to Republican delegates from Texas at a breakfast in Cleveland on Thursday. Some delegates applauded him, but others were angry and demanded that he back Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2 . A handful left as he spoke. Mr. Cruz said he refused to be a ''servile puppy dog.''

Peters contributed reporting. \par \uc2 1,254 \uc2 words\par \uc2 22 July 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 10\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 CLEVELAND -- ''Tiffany! Tiffany!'' a middle-aged Republican delegate yelled to \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's 22-year-old daughter on the floor of the Republican National Convention Wednesday night. ''You were amazing last night,'' he said of her speech.\par \par \uc2 She smiled, cocked her head gratefully and thanked him.\par \par \uc2 On the streets outside the convention, a young woman approached \uc2 Ivanka \uc2 Trump\uc2 , Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's 34-year-old daughter, to ask for a selfie with her, which the woman instantly posted on \uc2 Instagram\uc2 . ''Week. Just. Made,'' the woman enthused in a caption under the photograph.\par \par \uc2 And on the floor of the Quicken Loans Arena, a man playfully asked \uc2 Eric \uc2 Trump\uc2 , Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's 32-year-old son, for a bottle of his family's wine. ''That's what everyone needs,'' Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  replied playfully. ''More wine.''\par \par \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2  may be the nominee, but here in Cleveland, his children are the attraction. Amid a sometimes chaotic convention -- punctuated by a delegate rebellion and plagiarism in the speech by the candidate's wife -- they are redefining the traditional role of a candidate's children and emerging as celebrities in their own right.\par \par \uc2 ''They're mainly the reason why everyone is here,'' said Alisha Curtis, 31, who works in the Arkansas governor's office and stopped \uc2 Ivanka \uc2 Trump\uc2  on the street Wednesday for a photo that she then blasted out over social media. ''I'm very impressed with his children in general.''\par \par \uc2 Acting as a political SWAT team, the Trumps have arrived here with different, but complementary missions.\par \par \uc2 Ivanka \uc2 Trump\uc2  has played the ambassador, personally meeting with \uc2 Sheldon Adelson\uc2 , the billionaire Republican donor, whose willingness to open his wallet for her father could prove crucial in the general \uc2 election\uc2  this fall. Many doubted he would ever back Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  Jr\uc2 ., 38, has played the enforcer, denouncing \uc2 Corey Lewandowski\uc2 , his father's former campaign manager, as a ''bitter'' figure who is out to hurt his father's bid for the White House. ''Enough is enough,'' he thundered.\par \par \uc2 And Tiffany \uc2 Trump\uc2  has played the validator, divulging rare personal details about her father's style of parenting, like his habit of jotting handwritten notes across her high school report cards.\par \par \uc2 The attention they have drawn, flattering and relentless, has caught the \uc2 Trump\uc2  siblings off guard. ''After November, if I never take a selfie again, it will be too soon,'' \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  Jr\uc2 . said with a laugh in a telephone interview here on Wednesday.\par \par \uc2 But the affection from strangers, he added, was deeply humbling. ''It is an honor,'' he said.\par \par \uc2 It is a complicated role for a complicated family. Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  has five children from three marriages: Donald Jr., Ivanka, and Eric with his first wife, Ivana \uc2 Trump\uc2 ; Tiffany with his second, Marla Maples; and 10-year-old Barron with his current wife, Melania \uc2 Trump\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 The three oldest \uc2 Trump\uc2  children, Donald Jr., Ivanka and Eric, hold executive positions at the \uc2 Trump\uc2  Organization\uc2 , their father's real estate company, while Tiffany just graduated from the \uc2 University of Pennsylvania\uc2 , her father's alma mater. Together, they are perhaps their father's most powerful messengers -- successful, attractive, eloquent figures who lack his hard-edge style and pugilistic instincts.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , by his children's own admission, was not always a hands-on-father. ''I don't know what it's like to have a typical father figure,'' Tiffany \uc2 Trump\uc2  once told an interviewer. ''He's not the dad who's going to take me to the beach and go swimming, but he's such a motivational person.''\par \par \uc2 But in Cleveland over the past few days, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's adult children and son-in-law, \uc2 Jared Kushner\uc2  -- who make up his political cabinet -- are his unwavering cheerleaders and unified defenders.\par \par \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  Jr\uc2 . traveled to a suburb of Cleveland on Tuesday morning to mingle with delegates from Pennsylvania over breakfast, doing his best to relate to them: He recalled attending prep school and college in their state and described his love of hunting in its woods.\par \par \uc2 ''He was basically saying he's one of us and understands the values of Pennsylvania,'' said Marc Scaringi, a delegate who attended the event.\par \par \uc2 Eric \uc2 Trump\uc2  has participated in meetings here about how his father's White House would operate and who would hold top positions in his cabinet.\par \par \uc2 And between television interviews, the three oldest children personally thanked early supporters of their father, including Gov. Asa Hutchinson of Arkansas, providing crucial face time when Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  was traveling outside Cleveland. (Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  likes to return home every night, and Melania \uc2 Trump\uc2  has proved a reluctant campaigner).\par \par \uc2 ''My father can't be everywhere at all times,'' \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  Jr\uc2 . said, explaining that he and his siblings are ''able to show up and go places and meet with people who have been instrumental in the campaign.''\par \par \uc2 ''We want to show them the respect and give them the time they deserve,'' he said.\par \par \uc2 Their powerful place in the campaign is not lost on Republican Party leaders. On Wednesday night, Reince Priebus, the Republican National Committee chairman, accompanied the siblings between the convention hall and their hotel and introduced them to prominent donors and leaders.\par \par \uc2 The family's tight bond has been on full display all week. In the lobby of their hotel, the laughing and chatting siblings were so consumed by each other they did not notice when their father's running mate, \uc2 Gov. Mike Pence\uc2  of Indiana -- dripping with sweat after a pre-speech workout -- walked right by them and back into the elevators.\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 Trump\uc2  children are not above the age-old political ritual of acting as visual props -- providing a Kennedyesque tableau for television networks to replay throughout the day. On Wednesday, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's kids and their spouses gathered with Mr. Pence to welcome their dad back to Cleveland. As the Republican nominee's \uc2 Trump\uc2 -branded helicopter kicked up a swirling wind, his family stood in a line clapping, before walking out to greet him, processionlike, as cameras clicked away.\par \par \uc2 But even when they are sitting mute on the convention floor, they exhibit a kind of magnetic pull.\par \par \uc2 Not even celebrities can resist it. \uc2 CNN\uc2 's top on-air political reporter, Dana Bash, approached them on Wednesday night, holding up a cellphone camera to reveal her son at home, live on screen. She wanted to show him the Trumps.\par \par \uc2 Not long after, a Montana delegate named Terra Pierce negotiated her way past security guards to get a glimpse of the children and show off her Ivanka \uc2 Trump\uc2 -branded leather sandals.\par \par \uc2 ''Her name is on them,'' Ms. Pierce explained, pointing to her feet.\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 Trump\uc2  children, she said, ''are such a class act.''\par \par \uc2 Find out what you need to know about the 2016 presidential race today, and get politics news updates via \uc2 Facebook\uc2 , \uc2 Twitter\uc2  and the First Draft newsletter.\par \par \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  Jr., at the Republican National Convention on Monday, has played the enforcer in his father's campaign, denouncing Corey Lewandowski, a former campaign manager, as ''bitter.''

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 PARIS -- A few days before the Bastille Day terrorist attack in Nice, President \uc2 Obama\uc2  was in Poland for the \uc2 NATO\uc2  summit meeting, his mind obviously as much in Dallas as in Warsaw. As I listened to him during his closing news conference, on July 9, I was struck by the sad, tired, almost defeatist tone in the way the leader of the most powerful nation on earth addressed the divisions within American society, after that week's killings. ''This is not who we are,'' he insisted, as if trying to convince himself.\par \par \uc2 By the time he spoke in Dallas three days later, at the memorial service for the police officers shot dead there, President \uc2 Obama\uc2  seemed to have regained his confidence. But two days later, on July 14, I was reminded of that brief moment when he let his guard down as I listened to another president, \uc2 Fran\u231\'00\'E7ois Hollande\uc2 , speaking during an interview on French television. Mr. Hollande said that the state of emergency in force since the Nov. 13 terrorist attacks would soon be lifted. But as much as he wanted to sound optimistic, with a presidential \uc2 election\uc2  10 months away, he still looked somber toward the end. ''To be president,'' he said, ''means to have to face death, tragedy.''\par \par \uc2 That was lunch time on Bastille Day. At 3 the next morning, the French president was back on television, after the carnage that killed 84 people on the enchanting Promenade des Anglais in Nice, to announce that the state of emergency would be extended, for the third time. ''France is strong, stronger than the fanatics that want to strike her,'' he said. His opponents were quick to ridicule him either for having suggested that the state of emergency would be lifted, or for keeping it in force even though it had proved useless to prevent the attack in Nice.\par \par \uc2 Today, France and the United States are probably the West's two main targets of Islamist terrorism. In France, our government warns that we must ''learn to live with terrorism.'' Yet just when they need to be stronger, our societies seem fragile, tense, stirred by powerful winds of revolt against their elites and an economic order that has increased inequalities. Can they withstand the shock?\par \par \uc2 Defying the odds through the last 18 difficult months -- three bloody waves of terrorist attacks and sporadic terrorist incidents, strikes, violent protests against a reform of labor laws, high unemployment and floods -- the French have proved surprisingly resilient. The annual survey of the National Consultative Human Rights Commission, carried out in January, even showed tolerance on the rise ''despite the posture of some public figures.'' While the 2008 economic crisis reduced tolerance, the 2015 attacks produced the opposite effect, ''leading to soul-searching and civic mobilization'' against extremists, the commission said.\par \par \uc2 Similarly, the \uc2 Pew Research Center\uc2 's 2016 Global Attitudes Survey found that France (the \uc2 European Union\uc2  country with the biggest Muslim and Jewish populations) was the European nation second only to Spain in valuing diversity. The monthlong Euro soccer competition, hosted by France just before the Nice attack, also inspired intense fervor from the French public for its very diverse national team; it was supported throughout by enthusiastic singing of ''The Marseillaise,'' even after it lost the final game.\par \par \uc2 Some statistics from the Ministry of Interior, though, show a different picture: The number of racist criminal acts went up 22.4 percent in 2015. The reason for this contradiction, the \uc2 Human Rights Commission\uc2 's experts suggest, is that while individuals who carry out such acts are becoming more radicalized, the society at large is more aware of the dangers of polarization. This attitude shows in an increasing number of civic initiatives, and in the results of the regional \uc2 election\uc2  last December: After the far-right National Front did very well in the first round, voters rallied against it and prevented it from winning a single region in the second round.\par \par \uc2 Whether such healthy reactions will prevail after the Nice massacre -- and any future one -- is an open question. With a big immigrant population from North Africa and a very strong National Front locally, Nice itself is particularly vulnerable.\par \par \uc2 The sad reality is that people of good will are not helped by a significantly mediocre political establishment. There could be national unity at the bottom -- if only there were at the top.\par \par \uc2 This was illustrated again immediately after the Bastille Day attack. While citizens of all backgrounds and colors joined to pay their respects to the victims on the Promenade des Anglais, while the florists of Nice united to cover the bloodied avenue with flowers, while the nation was in shock, our politicians bickered over whether the government could have prevented this new atrocity. With the 2017 presidential \uc2 election\uc2  flashing big on his radar screen, Mr. Hollande's rival and predecessor, \uc2 Nicolas Sarkozy\uc2 , did not even wait for the end of three days of national mourning before mounting a ferocious attack on what he saw as the government's passivity.\par \par \uc2 The political debate in France has not quite reached the abyss of the campaign for the June 23 referendum on Brexit in Britain yet, nor of \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's surreal pronouncements, but it is going in that direction. Le Monde's longtime cartoonist Plantu feels that politicians, media and social networks have stolen his job: ''They are now more caricatural than my own caricatures,'' he said. In an interview with the Journal du Dimanche on Sunday, Prime Minister \uc2 Manuel Valls\uc2  openly worried about a trend that he describes as ''the Trumpization of minds.'' This, he said, ''cannot be our response to the Islamic State.''\par \par \uc2 When citizens behave more wisely than the men and women who compete to represent them, the time has come to take a hard look at the state of our political systems and its impact on our societies further down the road -- particularly when modern democracies are under threat from outside forces that have declared war on them.\par \par \uc2 Follow The \uc2 New York Times\uc2  Opinion section on \uc2 Facebook\uc2  and \uc2 Twitter\uc2 , and sign up for the Opinion Today newsletter.\par \par \uc2 Sylvie Kauffmann, the editorial director and a former editor in chief of Le Monde, is a contributing opinion writer.\par \par \uc2 Document NYTF000020160722ec7m00036\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 CLEVELAND -- \uc2 Mike Pence\uc2 's quest to be vice president has suddenly left a gap on Indiana's ballot for governor, and the battle to replace him has been playing out in the unlikeliest of places: a desolate airport hotel in Cleveland, the temporary home of Indiana's Republican delegation.\par \par \uc2 The group may be small, but seemingly everyone who matters is here -- most of the people who want to be governor, and most of the people who will choose the new Republican nominee. The result has been an Indiana-only shadow convention of sorts, an intense, chaotic, awkward week of brazen lobbying at the breakfast buffet, in the hallways and on the elevators of a Hilton Garden Inn.\par \par \uc2 Calls, texts and one-on-one meetings with the three best-known candidates have nearly exhausted some on the Republican State Central Committee, a group of 22 officials -- 16 of whom are here -- who intend to name a new nominee for governor next week.\par \par \uc2 Whispers have started over which would-be nominees sat beside committee members during daily bus rides to the national convention site. And leaflets promoting at least one hopeful, Representative Todd Rokita, have appeared under committee members' hotel room doors at night -- the work, Mr. Rokita cheerfully claimed, of ''Rokita elves.''\par \par \uc2 ''It's just so, so difficult to make this pick,'' said Craig Dunn, a Republican county chairman who sits on the State Central Committee and like most of his colleagues has known the major candidates a long time and has deep ties to all of them. ''We're a pretty jovial, congenial bunch, but there's kind of a look of seriousness I'm seeing now on people's faces. It's a pretty big decision for 22 people to make. We're in uncharted water here.''\par \par \uc2 Mostly unnoticed in the selection last week of Mr. Pence as \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's running mate was how the decision upended Indiana's state politics, setting off a chain of events that left at least four major races in question with months to go. Indiana's politics have been defined by the overwhelming Republican majority in the state capital in recent years, and this unexpected game of musical chairs is raising a flash of hope for Democrats.\par \par \uc2 ''The political scene in Indiana just turned upside down,'' said Marsha Coats, a member of the \uc2 Republican National Committee\uc2  and the wife of Senator Dan Coats, who is retiring.\par \par \uc2 As Mr. Pence withdrew his candidacy for re-\uc2 election\uc2  last week, so did three other Republicans -- two members of Congress, Mr. Rokita and Representative Susan W. Brooks, as well as Lt. Gov. Eric Holcomb. All now hope to be picked as the nominee for governor instead.\par \par \uc2 At least one state senator also hopes to be the nominee, and state officials said this week that they were hearing ''rumbles'' that still more people might raise their hands for the job before the state central committee's private meeting and secret-ballot vote, scheduled for Tuesday back in Indiana. Some Indiana Republicans had urged \uc2 Mitch Daniels\uc2 , who preceded Mr. Pence as governor and whose legacy often seemed to overshadow Mr. Pence's tenure, to return to office, but Mr. Daniels removed his name from consideration last week.\par \par \uc2 What Indiana's leaders and political operatives from both parties do not agree on is this: whether Mr. Pence's departure deals a significant blow to the Republicans' chances of holding on to the governor's office or whether it may actually help them.\par \par \uc2 Any replacement for Mr. Pence is likely to have far less name recognition than a sitting governor and significant ground to make up in fund-raising in a year when a popular Indiana name, \uc2 Evan Bayh\uc2 , is unexpectedly back on the Democratic ticket, seeking a return to the \uc2 United States Senate\uc2  to replace Mr. Coats.\par \par \uc2 John Gregg, the Democratic candidate for governor who narrowly lost to Mr. Pence four years ago, went right on as usual this week, campaigning at county fairs and diners. In an interview, Mr. Gregg said his yearslong effort to serve as governor now separated him from the crop of Republicans suddenly jockeying for the job.\par \par \uc2 ''Voters will wonder, in the case of the others, Do they just see this as an opportunity?'' he said.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Pence received intense criticism in his first term, especially from business-minded Republicans for his signing of a law that could have made it easier for religious conservatives to deny services to same-sex couples. Some polls suggested that he was facing a tight rematch for governor against Mr. Gregg.\par \par \uc2 ''The state has a little bit of a Governor Pence hangover,'' said \uc2 Bill Oesterle\uc2 , the former chief executive of Indianapolis-based Angie's List and a Republican who has been encouraging Mr. Daniels to run for governor. ''Until we know who that new face is, we can't really tell, but there is an opportunity to pick a candidate who will perform much better.''\par \par \uc2 Back in Cleveland, in the close quarters of the Hilton Garden Inn, the rushed, intensely personal campaign to win over at least 12 of the 22 state central committee members played out in hotel alcoves and conference rooms. Adding to the confusion, the candidates who do not get the governor's nomination are widely expected to seek permission to go back to vying for ballot positions for their current jobs -- the very ones they withdrew from.\par \par \uc2 ''We're very blessed,'' said Jeff Cardwell, the chairman of the Indiana Republican Party and one of the 16 central committee members in Cleveland. ''We've got a deep bench, and this is grass-roots politicking at its best.''\par \par \uc2 As Ms. Brooks strode through the hotel lobby shortly before meeting a committee member on Tuesday afternoon, she described the situation this way: ''I call it the fishbowl.'' A former United States attorney in her second term in the House, Ms. Brooks is not a convention delegate but made the trip with her husband, who is, and it is paying off. ''For me, it's a job interview,'' she said.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Rokita, a three-term congressman, said the candidates found themselves in a rare political quandary: trying to impress their case upon only a few people who, in many instances, already knew them well. ''There's a lot of emotion going on here,'' Mr. Rokita said. ''There's a lot of fair-haired girls and boys.''\par \par \uc2 All were on the lookout for hints of preference. So when Mr. Holcomb, who recently became lieutenant governor but spent years working as an adviser to Mr. Daniels, was called forward on Tuesday to nominate Mr. Pence as vice president before the national convention, some took note.\par \par \uc2 The choice had been kept quiet until just before he spoke, some Indiana Republicans said, wondering aloud what, if anything, it might have signaled.\par \par \uc2 Find out what you need to know about the 2016 presidential race today, and get politics news updates via \uc2 Facebook\uc2 , \uc2 Twitter\uc2  and the First Draft newsletter.\par \par \uc2 Representative Todd Rokita, center, is among the Indiana Republicans hoping to be chosen as the party's nominee for governor.

\par\par \uc2 ABROAD IN AMERICA\par \uc2 Foreign Desk; SECT\par \b \uc2 Behind a Facade of G.O.P. Unity, Frayed Edges Painfully Exposed\b0\par\par\uc2 By DECLAN WALSH \par \uc2 1,220 \uc2 words\par \uc2 22 July 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 The New York Times on the Web\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 CLEVELAND -- It is supposed to be a coronation, a showy political pageant where one of America's two great parties triumphantly crowns its presidential contender. But this week's Republican convention has had the charged air of a Roman colosseum, a fraught and strange affair driven by gladiatorial cries, bear-pit politics and calls for retribution against enemies near and far.\par \par \uc2 A former soldier issued a bellicose call for more airstrikes in the Middle East. Syrian refugees were painted as Islamic State infiltrators. A handful of African-American speakers disparaged black-rights groups. Numerous speeches assailed the presumptive Democratic nominee, \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , in unforgiving terms.\par \par \uc2 ''Lock her up!'' chanted the crowd during several unbridled speeches that painted Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  as a liar, a criminal, a national security risk and -- somehow -- a sympathizer of Lucifer. At times it felt as if the delegates, overwhelmingly white and older, were waiting for a robed figure to emerge with his thumb pointed up or down.\par \par \uc2 ''You know who you are,'' said \uc2 Rudolph W. Giuliani\uc2 , a former mayor of New York, in a fear-flecked denunciation of unspecified Islamic terrorists that roused the crowd to its feet. ''And we're coming to get you!''\par \par \uc2 Looming in the background was \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , the polarizing billionaire who has swept aside the Republican Party's once-powerful Washington leadership, forged a powerful new political brand around anger and denunciation, and has now become the party's nominee for the highest office of the land -- and the most powerful job in the world.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  is scheduled to formally accept his nomination Thursday night, a potentially transformative moment in American politics. The storied party of Abraham Lincoln, founded on a mandate of containing the spread of slavery, is now headed by a candidate who has divided the country, and the Republicans, like none other in decades.\par \par \uc2 On the surface, Republicans seem to be uniting through the cherished, quirky rituals of the four-day conference. In the bustling corridors of the Quicken Loans Arena, the cavernous hall in the lakeside city of Cleveland where it is taking place, delegates bustle about with good-natured cheer, many sporting outlandish hats shaped like Christmas trees or elephants. A woman from Tennessee wore a raccoon skin on her head.\par \par \uc2 ''We're the Cheeseheads,'' said Barbara Finger, a retiree from Wisconsin who wore a hat shaped like a wedge of cheese, the state's signature product.\par \par \uc2 Behind the facade of unity, though, frayed edges have become painfully exposed. Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's steamroller success has caused many party grandees, including the two former Presidents Bush, to stay away. A rowdy, last-ditch effort by insurgent ''Stop \uc2 Trump\uc2 '' delegates failed, but set a sour tone. A day later, delegates on the other side of the divide greeted Sen. Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, a powerful old-style party boss (and the majority leader) with a round of boos.\par \par \uc2 Caught in the middle is Rep. Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin, the speaker of the House and chairman of this conclave, who delivered an awkward speech that was jammed between saccharine testimonies from former soap actors, minor sports figures and a woman who runs Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's winery.\par \par \uc2 What all agree on, though, is that Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's stunning victory is rooted in his ability to tap directly into American discontent. Jason R. Anavitarte, a delegate from Georgia who campaigned for one of his vanquished rivals, \uc2 Sen. Marco Rubio\uc2  of Florida, said Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  had ''turned anger and frustration into a product'' that would be salable this fall.\par \par \uc2 ''There's many people who haven't bounced back from the crash in 2008,'' he said of America's real estate and economic crisis. ''They feel disconnected from mainstream politics. He lets all of that anger that people have built up just come out of his mouth''.\par \par \uc2 Laurel Fee, who is 57, from Nevada, and an activist in the conservative Tea Party movement that previously tore Republicans apart, affirmed that idea. ''He's the first one to say the stuff the rest of us talk about around the water cooler,'' Ms. Fee said.\par \par \uc2 Some of Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's critics, alarmed by his mix of brash tactics, bullying speeches and casual relationship with the truth, have found a measure of cold comfort of late across the Atlantic in Britain's vote to exit the \uc2 European Union\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Similar factors are driving inward-facing politics in both countries, experts say: anger among the losers from globalization, frustration with traditional elites, anxiety over immigration and bubbling xenophobia. Among the foreign guests in Cleveland this week is Nigel Farage, the British anti-immigration politician who was a driving force behind ''Brexit,'' and Geert Wilders, a right-wing Dutch member of Parliament best known for his trenchant criticism of Islam.\par \par \uc2 ''It's a mix of economics and identity,'' said Robin Niblett, the director of \uc2 Chatham House\uc2 , a research organization in London. In both countries, voters in struggling areas were reacting to a perceived slide in national sovereignty, he said, adding: ''People feel they have lost control.''\par \par \uc2 Just outside the Cleveland convention hall, Christopher Cox, founder of Bikers for \uc2 Trump\uc2 , posed for photographs with delegates as a John Denver song blared in the background. Political correctness had ''tongue-tied America,'' Mr. Cox declared. ''\uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  made it easier for patriots to stand up and speak their minds without fear of being called a racist.\par \par \uc2 ''Bikers are concerned with radical Islam, who's going to take the fight to ISIS,'' he added, referring to the Islamic State group. ''We want to see a wall built, to see Syrian refugees vetted. That's not racism, that's patriotism.''\par \par \uc2 The bikers were among dozens of niche groups that flooded into Cleveland this week: anarchists, evangelical Christians, civil-rights advocates, counterprotesters, fresh-faced young capitalists and socialists engaged in intense argument. ''Build a wall against \uc2 Trump\uc2 '' read one protester's sign, riffing on Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's signature proposal for a wall along the Mexican border; others openly carried guns, as Ohio state law permits. A preacher screamed himself hoarse with warnings of damnation; another man brought his pet iguana.\par \par \uc2 They assembled in Cleveland's Public Square, under a Civil War monument depicting Abraham Lincoln freeing a slave. The arguments swang between serious and ridiculous -- a prominent figure, a self-styled provocateur who wore a rubber boot on his head, gave his name as Vermin Supreme -- and mostly they were peaceful.\par \par \uc2 But the shouting turned to confrontation between rival groups at one point on Tuesday, drawing hundreds of police officers on foot, on horseback and on bicycles.\par \par \uc2 At first the police clustered in a serried square; then they chased the anarchists on bikes down an empty street. The chase ended outside a shuttered cigar store. But there were more photographers than protesters, and the standoff was over after a few scuffles.\par \par \uc2 Vermin Supreme, dressed in shorts, harangued the police through a bullhorn. ''Come on people,'' he said to the unspeaking officers. ''Let's have a bit of niceness.''\par \par \uc2 Abroad in America, written by a Times foreign correspondent, approaches the \uc2 election\uc2  in much the same way as we would events overseas, deciphering the action for a global audience.\par \par \uc2 Follow Declan Walsh on Twitter @declanwalsh .\par \par \uc2 Document NYTF000020160722ec7m0003d\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 Foreign Desk; SECT\par \b \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2 's Remarks Rattle NATO Allies and Stoke Debate on Cost Sharing\b0\par\par\uc2 By SEWELL CHAN; Neil MacFarquhar contributed reporting from Moscow. \par \uc2 1,276 \uc2 words\par \uc2 22 July 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 The New York Times on the Web\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 LONDON -- \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's statement that the United States might not come to the defense of \uc2 NATO\uc2  allies that do not foot their share of the bill fueled anxiety on Thursday in a Europe that is already deeply unsettled about Russia's assertive posture, Britain's decision to withdraw from the \uc2 European Union\uc2  and the rise of inward-looking populist and nationalist parties.\par \par \uc2 In an interview with The \uc2 New York Times\uc2 , Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  suggested that if elected president he would use a country's level of military spending as a factor in deciding whether the United States would honor its commitment to defend any member nation that comes under attack. While President Obama and other American officials have also pressed European countries in recent years to increase military spending in line with their commitments to \uc2 NATO\uc2 , Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  more explicitly linked financial considerations to the strategic response he would order as president in the event of an attack by Russia.\par \par \uc2 His comments left some European officials concerned that the United States under Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  would edge away from the security guarantees that Washington has provided to the Continent since World War II. But they also stoked the debate over cost sharing after years in which Europe had been slow to meet its commitments on military spending.\par \par \uc2 Jens Stoltenberg\uc2 , NATO's secretary general and a former prime minister of Norway, said that he ''will not interfere in the U.S. \uc2 election\uc2  campaign,'' but made clear that he was alarmed by Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's remarks.\par \par \uc2 ''Solidarity among allies is a key value for \uc2 NATO\uc2 ,'' he said in a statement. ''This is good for European security and good for U.S. security. We defend one another. We have seen this in Afghanistan, where tens of thousands of European, Canadian and partner-nation troops have stood shoulder to shoulder with U.S. soldiers.''\par \par \uc2 He added, ''Two world wars have shown that peace in Europe is also important for the security of the United States.''\par \par \uc2 Article 5 of the 1949 treaty that set up the \uc2 North Atlantic Treaty Organization\uc2  obliges any member of the alliance to come to the defense of another member if it comes under attack. The article has been invoked only once -- after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks on the United States.\par \par \uc2 ''They have an obligation to make payments,'' Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  said in the interview. ''Many \uc2 NATO\uc2  nations are not making payments, are not making what they're supposed to make.''\par \par \uc2 Asked whether the United States would come to the aid of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania -- three Baltic states that were invaded by the Soviet Union in 1940, and joined \uc2 NATO\uc2  in 2004 -- in the event of a Russian invasion, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  replied, ''I don't want to tell you what I'd do because I don't want Putin to know what I'd do,'' referring to Russia's president, \uc2 Vladimir V. Putin\uc2 , for whom Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  has expressed admiration.\par \par \uc2 Reminded that \uc2 NATO\uc2  members are obligated by treaty to come to one another's defense, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  responded: ''Have they fulfilled their obligations to us? If they fulfill their obligations to us, the answer is yes.''\par \par \uc2 Asked on Thursday about Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's comments, Defense Secretary Michael Fallon of Britain snapped: ''Article 5 is an absolute commitment. It doesn't come with conditions or caveats.''\par \par \uc2 Less than two weeks ago, at a \uc2 NATO\uc2  summit meeting in Warsaw, Mr. Obama reassured America's allies that ''in good times and in bad, Europe can count on the United States -- always.''\par \par \uc2 Toomas Hendrik Ilves, the president of Estonia, took to \uc2 Twitter\uc2  to emphasize that his country was one of only five \uc2 NATO\uc2  members to meet the target that it spend 2 percent of gross domestic product -- a broad measure of economic activity -- on military spending. (The others are the United States, Britain, Poland and Greece.)\par \par \uc2 Mr. Ilves also noted that Estonia contributed troops to the fight in Afghanistan in keeping with Article 5.\par \par \uc2 Artis Pabriks, a former foreign and defense minister of Latvia, which borders Russia and has stepped up military spending, wrote on \uc2 Twitter\uc2 : ''If \uc2 Trump\uc2  doubts \uc2 NATO\uc2  solidarity in the case of Article 5, then his \uc2 election\uc2  is dangerous for Baltic security.''\par \par \uc2 Lithuania's president, Dalia Grybauskaite, tried to calm her citizens. ''Regardless of who becomes the next president of the U.S., we trust America,'' she told reporters. ''It has always defended nations under attack, and will do so in the future.''\par \par \uc2 Ms. Grybauskaite added: ''Lithuania -- as well as other Baltic states -- is doing everything it can. We are modernizing our armed forces, we have reinstituted conscription and our defense spending will reach 2 percent of G.D.P. in 2018. I do not think interpretations of candidate \uc2 Trump\uc2 's remarks are necessary. We know that the U.S. will remain our most important partner.''\par \par \uc2 In Russia, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's comments met with approval. Alexei Pushkov, head of the foreign relations committee of the State Duma, the lower house of the Russian Parliament, contrasted Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  with \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , the presumptive Democratic nominee. ''\uc2 Clinton\uc2 's creed: strengthen the U.S.'s anti-Russian alliances. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's creed: respond only to real threats,'' Mr. Pushkov wrote. ''Aggressive banality versus common sense.''\par \par \uc2 NATO\uc2 's 28 members pledged at summit meetings in Wales in 2014 and in Warsaw this month to do more to meet the 2 percent of GDP spending target, and Mr. Stoltenberg has made reaching that goal a priority.\par \par \uc2 Xenia Wickett, the head of the United States and Americas program at \uc2 Chatham House\uc2 , a foreign policy think tank based in London, said Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  was echoing -- albeit in far less diplomatic terms -- concerns raised by a succession of American secretaries of defense, including the three who have served Mr. Obama: \uc2 Robert M. Gates\uc2 , Leon E. Panetta and Ashton B. Carter.\par \par \uc2 ''The U.S. is no longer willing to cover the approximately 75 percent of the \uc2 NATO\uc2  budget that it currently does,'' Ms. Wickett wrote in an email. ''\uc2 Trump\uc2  takes it to the extreme, which is new, but the direction is not new. \uc2 Trump\uc2  wants to see a more 'fair' division of labor.'' She added, ''Unfortunately, his way of expressing it is likely to aid our adversaries rather than assist the alliance.''\par \par \uc2 Alexandra de Hoop Scheffer, the head of the Paris office of the \uc2 German Marshall Fund of the United States\uc2 , a research organization, said too much was being made of Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's remarks. She said the imbalance in \uc2 NATO\uc2  spending ''is just not sustainable,'' adding, ''\uc2 Trump\uc2  is taking the burden-sharing debate to extreme levels, by directly calling into question U.S. responsibility as a \uc2 NATO\uc2  member state to fulfill its obligations under Article 5, in case a \uc2 NATO\uc2  member state got attacked by Russia.''\par \par \uc2 She added that European leaders needed to persuade their citizens ''of the importance of investing in defense to face current and future security challenges.''\par \par \uc2 But Carl Bildt, a former prime minister and foreign minister of Sweden, said he feared that Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's remarks would embolden autocratic and aggressive powers. ''There is certainly a risk that he will encourage states like Russia and China to take the risk that U.S. will not stand up for its allies and its commitments, and that could be extremely dangerous for global stability,'' he said. ''He's downplaying not only the defense of common interests, but also the defense of common values. Democracy seems nearly to be a derogatory term for him.''\par \par \uc2 Follow Sewell Chan on Twitter @sewellchan.\par \par \uc2 Document NYTF000020160722ec7m00064\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 National Desk; SECTA\par \b \uc2 Moneyed Class Finds Place in Current G.O.P.\b0\par\par\uc2 By NICHOLAS CONFESSORE \par \uc2 1,312 \uc2 words\par \uc2 22 July 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 1\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 CLEVELAND -- In his unlikely rise to the Republican nomination \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2  attacked lobbyists, disparaged big donors and railed against the party's establishment. But on the shores of Lake Erie this week, beyond the glare of television cameras, the power of the permanent political class seemed virtually undisturbed.\par \par \uc2 Though Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  promises to topple Washington's ''rigged system,'' the opening rounds of his party's quadrennial meeting accentuated a more enduring maxim: Money always adapts to power.\par \par \uc2 At a downtown barbecue joint, lobbyists cheerfully passed out stickers reading ''Make Lobbying Great Again'' as they schmoozed on Monday with Republican ambassadors, lawmakers and executives. At a windowless bar tucked behind the \uc2 Ritz-Carlton\uc2  hotel, whose rooms were set aside for the party's most generous benefactors, allies of Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  pitched a clutch of receptive party donors on contributing to a pro-\uc2 Trump\uc2  ''super PAC.''\par \par \uc2 And on Tuesday night, as Republican delegates formally made Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  their presidential nominee, a few dozen lobbyists and their clients instead sipped gin and munched on Brie puffs in an oak-paneled room at the Union Club. They had come to witness a more urgent presentation: \uc2 Newt Gingrich\uc2 , a top \uc2 Trump\uc2  adviser and Beltway fixture, painting an upbeat picture of the deals they could help sculpt on infrastructure projects and military spending in the first hundred days of a \uc2 Trump\uc2  administration.\par \par \uc2 ''It is the business of Washington,'' said Michael J. Anderson, a Democratic lobbyist who represents American Indian tribes, after watching Mr. Gingrich speak. ''Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  is talking about changing the paradigm. It's not changing one bit. The political and influence class is going on as before.''\par \par \uc2 In Cleveland, even some of those who had worked against Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's candidacy now saw opportunity.\par \par \uc2 In dozens of private receptions, behind a scrim of barricades and police officers, they inspected their party's new \uc2 Trump\uc2  faction with curiosity and hope. There were spheres of influence to carve out. There was money to raise and money to be made, whether or not Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  ended up in the White House. There were new friends to make and old relationships to nurture.\par \par \uc2 ''This is an event like no other -- there are governors, senators, members of Congress,'' said Eric J. Tanenblatt, a longtime ally of the Bush family whose law firm, Dentons, hosted Mr. Gingrich's remarks on Tuesday. ''For people who operate in and around government, you can't not be here.''\par \par \uc2 And so, far above the din of protesters and delegates, on the 49th floor of the Key Tower, \uc2 Squire Patton Boggs\uc2 , a lobbying and legal powerhouse, held packed receptions honoring Ohio and Florida officials. Not far away, Mike Leavitt, the former Utah governor turned consultant for pharmaceutical companies and health insurers, was slated to lead a panel on policies to spur the development of prescription drugs. As Speaker Paul D. Ryan helped tamp down anti-\uc2 Trump\uc2  efforts on the convention floor, his political operation ran a daily series of receptions and hospitality lounges for members of the ''Speaker's Council,'' the top donors to House Republicans.\par \par \uc2 ''You have these two worlds colliding a little bit here,'' said David Tamasi, a lobbyist at the firm Rasky Baerlein and a top Republican fund-raiser on K Street, who joined Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's team after his preferred candidate, \uc2 Gov. Chris Christie\uc2  of New Jersey, went down to defeat. ''That's what's going to be interesting: How do the establishment guys make those folks feel at home?''\par \par \uc2 They are doing so, in part, by footing the bill.\par \par \uc2 While some of the party's elite donors have shunned Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's coronation this week, they are still paying for it. Roughly 500 wealthy Republicans poured close to $16 million into the \uc2 Republican National Committee\uc2 's convention account leading up to this week, according to disclosures made to the \uc2 Federal \uc2 Election\uc2  Commission\uc2  through last Friday. The biggest donors, giving more than $100,000 each, are also a veritable roll call of the stop-\uc2 Trump\uc2  movement, among them the billionaire investor Paul E. Singer and Marlene Ricketts, who bankrolled early efforts to deny Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  the nomination.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Singer did not attend, though his political advisers made the rounds in Cleveland, as did representatives for other megadonors who remain opposed to Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 . And there were growing signs that at least some of the party's biggest givers were warming to him: Co-hosts of Monday's super PAC reception at the \uc2 Ritz-Carlton\uc2  included Harold Hamm, a billionaire oil tycoon and former energy adviser to \uc2 Mitt Romney\uc2 , and \uc2 Stanley Hubbard\uc2 , a Minnesota television station owner and prominent donor.\par \par \uc2 Among the guests was Foster Friess, the Wyoming-based mutual fund investor and super PAC donor, who expressed optimism at his party's prospects. ''I think it could be a landslide,'' Mr. Friess said in an interview. ''\uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  has the ability to reach all the plumbers and carpenters and factory workers who usually vote Democratic.''\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , of course, remains unpopular among many Republican donors, and it is unclear how many will ultimately open their wallets to help fund his campaign. Some events were more sparsely attended than they would have been four years ago, Republicans said. It was a little easier to get tickets to concerts in Cleveland, a little easier to get bumped up to the premium hotel rooms.\par \par \uc2 And there is no question that Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's blasts against unfettered trade and Wall Street banks have unsettled powerful business interests -- and are now, to some extent, reflected in the party's own DNA. In recent days, \uc2 Trump\uc2  activists have helped install new planks in the party platform calling for tougher trade negotiations and for reinstating the Glass-Steagall Act, the Depression-era law that walled commercial banking off from investment banking.\par \par \uc2 Yet those same power brokers won a more consequential victory even before the convention started, when Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's team helped them quash a rule proposed by some conservative delegates that would have banned lobbyists from serving as \uc2 Republican National Committee\uc2  members. The proposal by supporters of Senator Ted Cruz of Texas pitted Tea Party conservatives against the party's business wing; the conservative delegates were soundly defeated.\par \par \uc2 ''It is disappointing,'' said Mary Anne Kinney, a New Hampshire state representative and Cruz delegate, who was among those who pushed for the ban. ''Some of us had heard things that maybe \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  was not a fan of the lobbyists. They are not always for the interest of the people.''\par \par \uc2 In fact, many of them are for the interests of Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , at least this week. Among the floor whips prowling the convention floor in Cleveland in neon yellow baseball caps, managing and corralling delegates, were a number of volunteers from Washington government affairs firms or Capitol Hill. Many had supported other candidates during the primary. Now they were working for their party's nominee.\par \par \uc2 One of them was Robert Hoffman, a Republican lobbyist at Heather Podesta and Partners. Earlier in the week, the firm hosted a barbecue brunch for friends and delegates, where Mr. Hoffman and his colleagues handed out ''Make Lobbying Great Again'' stickers.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Hoffman seemed to see Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's policy agenda more in terms of possibilities than threats. The convention, he noted, was a chance to learn more about Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's still-vague plans, and perhaps to help shape them.\par \par \uc2 ''We want to be a sounding board,'' Mr. Hoffman said. ''Not just for our clients, but for our campaign.''\par \par \uc2 Find out what you need to know about the 2016 presidential race today, and get politics news updates via \uc2 Facebook\uc2 , \uc2 Twitter\uc2  and the First Draft newsletter.\par \par \uc2 Newt Gingrich, a convention speaker on Wednesday, had encouraged Republican lobbyists on Tuesday night.

\par\par \uc2 Politics; SECT\par \b \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  and \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  Deadlocked in New Ohio Poll\b0\par\par\uc2 By ALAN RAPPEPORT \par \uc2 368 \uc2 words\par \uc2 22 July 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 The New York Times on the Web\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2  and \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  are deadlocked in Ohio, according to a new poll that shows the crucial state very much in play as Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  prepares to accept the Republican Party's presidential nomination in Cleveland on Thursday night.\par \par \uc2 A new survey from Suffolk University finds that Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  and Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  each have the support of 44 percent of likely voters, with 11 percent still undecided. When third-party candidates such as \uc2 Gary Johnson\uc2 , the Libertarian Party nominee, and the Green Party's Jill Stein are included, Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  holds a four-point lead.\par \par \uc2 ''It's absolutely up for grabs,'' said David Paleologos, director of the Suffolk University Political Research Center.\par \par \uc2 The poll is in line with other surveys of Ohio voters that show the race being very close. Ohio is a critical battleground that could dictate the outcome of the \uc2 election\uc2 , and both candidates are expected to campaign aggressively across the state.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Paleologos noted that there is a sharp contrast between how the candidates perform in urban centers such as Cleveland, which favors Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , and the outer counties that lean toward Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 . Although the addition of \uc2 Gov. Mike Pence\uc2  as Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's running mate has not had an immediate impact, Mr. Paleologos suggests that it could help him in areas that border Mr. Pence's home state of Indiana.\par \par \uc2 Terrorism and the economy, which are seen as strong areas for Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , remain the most important issues to voters in Ohio. Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's proposal for a temporary ban on Muslim migration has not turned off voters, as 48 percent support the idea and 45 percent oppose it.\par \par \uc2 Third-party candidates could end up being the deciding factor in the race in Ohio, as the 5 percent of the vote that Mr. Johnson is getting is siphoning more support away from Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  than it is from Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 The poll had a margin of error of plus or minus four percentage points.\par \par \uc2 Find out what you need to know about the 2016 presidential race today, and get politics news updates via \uc2 Facebook\uc2 , \uc2 Twitter\uc2  and the First Draft newsletter.\par \par \uc2 Document NYTF000020160722ec7m0004t\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 National Desk; SECTA\par \b \uc2 Trump\uc2 , as Nominee, Vows: 'I Am Your Voice'\b0\par\par\uc2 By PATRICK HEALY and JONATHAN MARTIN \par \uc2 1,800 \uc2 words\par \uc2 22 July 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 1\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 CLEVELAND -- \uc2 Donald John \uc2 Trump\uc2  accepted the Republican presidential nomination on Thursday night with an unusually vehement appeal to Americans who feel that their country is spiraling out of control and yearn for a leader who will take aggressive, even extreme, actions to protect them.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , 70, a New York real estate developer and reality television star who leveraged his fame and forceful persona to become the rare political outsider to lead the ticket of a major party, drew exuberant cheers from Republican convention delegates as he strode onto the stage of the Quicken Loans Arena and delivered a speech as fiery as his candidacy.\par \par \uc2 With dark imagery and an almost angry tone, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  portrayed the United States as a diminished and even humiliated nation, and offered himself as an all-powerful savior who could resurrect the country's standing in the eyes of both enemies and law-abiding Americans.\par \par \uc2 ''Our convention occurs at a moment of crisis for our nation,'' an ominous-sounding Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  said, standing against a backdrop of American flags. ''The attacks on our police, and the terrorism in our cities, threaten our very way of life. Any politician who does not grasp this danger is not fit to lead our country.''\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  nearly shouted the names of states where police officers had been killed recently, as the crowd erupted in applause, and returned repeatedly to the major theme of the speech: ''Law and order,'' he said four times, each time drawing out the syllables.\par \par \uc2 Evoking the tumult of the 1960s and the uncertainty that followed the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  made a sharp departure from the optimistic talk about American possibility that has characterized Republican presidential candidates since Ronald Reagan redefined the party over 30 years ago. In promoting his hard-line views on crime, immigration and hostile nations, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  was wagering that voters would embrace his style of populism and his promises of safety if they feel even less secure by \uc2 Election\uc2  Day.\par \par \uc2 But his speech -- the longest, at an hour and 15 minutes, since at least 1972 -- had relatively little new to offer women, Hispanics, blacks and others who have been turned off by Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's incendiary brand of politics. He did sound like a different sort of Republican at times, though, making no mention of abortion -- a core issue for many Republicans -- and saying of his support among evangelical voters, ''I'm not sure I totally deserve it.''\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  also challenged Republican orthodoxy as he promised to end multilateral trade deals and limit American intervention in global crises. He denounced ''15 years of wars in the Middle East'' -- a rebuke of his party's last president, George W. Bush -- and pledged to help union members, coal miners and other low-wage Americans who have historically supported Democrats.\par \par \uc2 ''These are the forgotten men and women of our country,'' said Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , a billionaire with a mixed record of job creation and layoffs. ''People who work hard but no longer have a voice -- I am your voice.''\par \par \uc2 He even vowed ''to do everything in my power to protect our L.G.B.T.Q. citizens from the violence and oppression of a hateful foreign ideology.'' As the audience applauded, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  made a deviation from his prepared text, observing: ''I have to say, that as a Republican, it is so nice to hear you cheering for what I just said.'''\par \par \uc2 Facing a restive party on the final night of a convention that has been unusually turbulent and divided, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  seemed to make headway in galvanizing and unifying at least those Republicans gathered in the hall. The nearly full arena was rapt as Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  spoke, and when he began discussing illegal immigration, a familiar chant quickly broke out in the arena: ''Build the wall, build the wall!''\par \par \uc2 And when he vowed to tell the truth ''plainly and honestly,'' a delegate cried from the floor: ''Bring it, Donald!''\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  dwelled at length on illegal immigrants and lawless Americans, saying they are as dangerous for the nation's security as the Islamic State and Syrian refugees. In doing so, \uc2 Trump\uc2  advisers said, he sought to win over undecided voters who are sickened by the recent violence against police officers and worried about safety yet are unsure if Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  has the temperament and abilities to be commander in chief.\par \par \uc2 ''I have a message to every last person threatening the peace on our streets and the safety of our police: When I take the oath of office next year, I will restore law and order to our country.''\par \par \uc2 While nomination speeches are traditionally optimistic and personal, full of hope and revelations that cast candidates in the best possible light for voters, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  sounded like a wartime president, using the word ''threat'' seven times and promising to ''defeat the barbarians of ISIS.'' He also recited homicide rates in American cities and the thousands of illegal immigrants with criminal records, promising to control violence at home and abroad.\par \par \uc2 ''It is time to show the whole world that America is back -- bigger, and better and stronger than ever before,'' Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  said.\par \par \uc2 He was blistering about \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , his Democratic opponent, and her tenure as secretary of state, arguing that her diplomatic strategy in Syria, Iraq, Egypt, Libya and other countries had led to civil unrest and political chaos and rendered her unfit to be president.\par \par \uc2 ''America is far less safe -- and the world is far less stable -- than when Obama made the decision to put \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  in charge of America's foreign policy,'' Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  said.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  said Americans had ''lived through one international humiliation after another'' under President Obama: the Navy sailors ''being forced to their knees'' by Iranian captors in January; the destruction of the American consulate in Benghazi, Libya; and Mr. Obama's decision not to defend his ''red line'' on Syria.\par \par \uc2 Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  shared the blame, too, he added.\par \par \uc2 ''This is the legacy of \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 : death, destruction, terrorism, and weakness,'' Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  said.\par \par \uc2 In a bid to appeal to Democrats unhappy with their party's embrace of Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , he invoked the political message of her chief rival, Senator Bernie Sanders, and suggested that Mr. Sanders shared Republicans' critique of her record.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's elder daughter, Ivanka, also sought to reach out to Democrats and moderates, extolling him as a champion of women in the workplace, and a leader who would ''take on the bold and worthy fights, who will be unafraid to set lofty goals and relentless in his determination to achieve them.''\par \par \uc2 This week's convention, which typically would have been choreographed carefully, was itself a departure from the norm. But if Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  injected drama and even spontaneity back into the formulaic gathering, he also tested the limits of improvisation over the last week.\par \par \uc2 The operatic quality of the first three days of the convention worried some Republicans. Presidential candidates have two major issues to deal with over the summer, their vice-presidential selection and their convention, and they felt he had bungled both. Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  chose his running mate haphazardly and then overshadowed the announcement of \uc2 Gov. Mike Pence\uc2  of Indiana by indulging in a rambling speech that revived questions about his seriousness.\par \par \uc2 The party staged a convention that reflected just how fractured it is. There were, to be sure, effective attacks on the character and record of Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , whose unpopularity among modern presidential nominees is exceeded only by Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's. But some of the anti-\uc2 Clinton\uc2  language spilled into ugliness and catcalls. The party at times seemed unified only around a shared determination to imprison the former secretary of state.\par \par \uc2 But the speeches dedicated to promoting Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  and the party's governing vision were hazy and at times collided with the candidate's own beliefs. Many of the elected officials who spoke extolled a traditional conservative platform that bears little relation to the nationalist agenda on which Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  is basing his campaign.\par \par \uc2 For example, just hours before Mr. Pence, a committed internationalist, assured delegates and millions of voters that America would defend its allies, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  gave an interview in which he balked at defending \uc2 NATO\uc2  countries, a policy that has been the cornerstone of the alliance for 70 years.\par \par \uc2 Even as Republicans prepared to leave Cleveland, they were still straining to come to terms with the views and personality of their newly minted nominee.\par \par \uc2 ''I'm going to vote for \uc2 Mike Pence\uc2 ,'' said Gov. Gary Herbert of Utah, pausing for effect: ''And \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  comes along with the package.''\par \par \uc2 Candidates who are trailing -- as Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  is, according to national polling averages -- must maximize the bump they typically enjoy in the polls after their conventions. Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  may see his standing improve after he leaves Cleveland on Friday, even though he did not fully seize the opportunity he was afforded after Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  was upbraided by the F.B.I. director over her private email server.\par \par \uc2 In many ways, the convention's formality was an awkward fit for Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , who soared in the primaries by energizing voters at freewheeling rallies with his off-the-cuff and frequently entertaining remarks.\par \par \uc2 Instead, for Thursday night, he relied on a teleprompter and a speech heavy with familiar Republican themes like cutting taxes, creating jobs, and pushing for education reforms to give parents more choice in schools for their children.\par \par \uc2 Yet he also made more personal promises as well, like being the ultimate safeguard for the younger generations of Americans.\par \par \uc2 ''To every parent who dreams for their child, and every child who dreams for their future, I say these words to you tonight: I'm with you, I will fight for you, and I will win for you,'' Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  said.\par \par \uc2 Find out what you need to know about the 2016 presidential race today, and get politics news updates via \uc2 Facebook\uc2 , \uc2 Twitter\uc2  and the First Draft newsletter.\par \par \uc2 ; Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2  and Mike Pence took the stage with family members as the convention closed Thursday night.

\par\par \uc2 CRITIC'S NOTEBOOK\par \uc2 Business/Financial Desk; SECTB\par \b \uc2 Roger Ailes Mastered the Intersection Where TV and Politics Meet\b0\par\par\uc2 By JAMES PONIEWOZIK \par \uc2 1,550 \uc2 words\par \uc2 22 July 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 1\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 American democracy is meant to be king-proof. Presidents win two terms, maximum. Supreme Court justices are one voice among nine (or, currently, eight), senators one in a hundred.\par \par \uc2 To amass the kind of long-term power that allows you to shape politics and culture geologically, like a river carving out a canyon, you have to go elsewhere. Roger Ailes found that place.\par \par \uc2 At Fox News -- the outlet Mr. Ailes created, ran and drove like a bullet train for two decades -- he was a unitary force. And he was not term-limited, until Thursday, when he stepped down over charges, which began with a lawsuit by the former Fox anchor Gretchen Carlson, that he sexually harassed a series of women over the years.\par \par \uc2 With Fox News, Mr. Ailes introduced a brash, point-of-view-based style that influences much of today's media. But the closest comparison for him might be less \uc2 CNN\uc2 's \uc2 Ted Turner\uc2  than someone like J. Edgar Hoover: a power behind the power, unelected but mighty, outliving administrations and the ebbs and flows of elections, ruling by force and fear.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Ailes was a TV guy before he was a politics guy, and then he became a TV guy again. But he recognized, faster than others, that on some level TV and politics were the same thing. They fed off the same energy and animal spirits.\par \par \uc2 It was Mr. Ailes, then the executive producer of ''The Mike Douglas Show,'' who persuaded Richard Nixon of the importance of television in the 1968 \uc2 election\uc2 . The candidate, who seemed blindsided in 1960 by the new medium, won the presidency through the first modern electronic-media campaign.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Ailes became a media guru for Republicans, prodding voters' lizard-brain centers of emotion and insecurity. For George H. W. Bush in 1988, he produced the sleazy and effective ''Revolving Door'' ad that tarred Michael Dukakis by association with murderers and rapists.\par \par \uc2 In 1996, he signed on to start a cable news channel for the conservative media mogul \uc2 Rupert Murdoch\uc2 , as dispirited conservatives were looking down the barrel of a second \uc2 Bill \uc2 Clinton\uc2  term. Fox News Channel, not Bob Dole or the \uc2 Clinton\uc2  impeachment case, would be conservatism's next great weapon.\par \par \uc2 Fox News Channel was a business opportunity rolled up in a political argument -- conservatives' belief that the news media were aligned against them. Its slogans, ''We report, you decide'' and ''Fair and balanced,'' were a wink and a promise. You decide to watch us, we'll balance this situation out.\par \par \uc2 Fox News gave Mr. Ailes an entire media outlet with which to abet and influence Republican politics, amplifying messages, sounding themes and picking winners.\par \par \uc2 He ran Fox like a political operation, down to its messaging and scorched-earth tactics against perceived enemies. Fox public relations worked and fought, in the words of the media columnist \uc2 David Carr\uc2  of The \uc2 New York Times\uc2 , like ''a kind of rolling opposition research operation.'' There was a parlor game, among types who covered media, of reading furious missives from Fox to detect the blast-furnace heat of Mr. Ailes's personal voice.\par \par \uc2 But Mr. Ailes also shaped TV news in the way that his TV-bred generation shaped politics. It was a revolution of tone, production style and manners as much as ideology.\par \par \uc2 Politics and media of the midcentury, pre-cable era were shaped by norms of tone and content. You respected certain codes of gravitas. You practiced professional dispassion. You might chase ratings, but you recognized an interest in appearing like something other than entertainment. Even \uc2 CNN\uc2 , which shook up the broadcast news paradigm, featured stately battleships of dignity like Bernard Shaw.\par \par \uc2 The idea of Fox News, journalistically and aesthetically, was: screw the norms. What if we just get right up in your face?\par \par \uc2 Yes, a big part of that was political. The Fox model was bifurcated, with conservative hosts dominating prime time. Like the honky-tonk in ''The Blues Brothers'' that had ''both kinds'' of music, ''country and western,'' it offered a rightist sampler running from Sean Hannity's party-loyal Republicanism to Bill O'Reilly's pugnacious East Coast populism.\par \par \uc2 The daytime was structured like a standard news report, but it was coded -- the tone, the choice of topics, the stylized-retro looks of the anchors -- that in a way told conservatives they were at home. Fox daytime ''played it straight,'' was the network's line. But if you had half an ear, you could pick up the tune.\par \par \uc2 Fox also changed the aesthetics of news, reflecting Mr. Ailes's political-operative instinct that messaging needs visceral pizazz. The graphics whooshed at you like a Blue Angels flyover. The soundtrack was percussive and martial. On Fox, the news was something to get pumped about, the mood always agitated -- less Walter Cronkite, more Michael Bay.\par \par \uc2 Fox's format made a powerful political platform and a good ratings proposition. Traditional programs or stations lived or died on the news cycle. On Fox, there was always reason to watch, some provocation, some grievance, some P. C. liberal somewhere going too far again.\par \par \uc2 After the 9/11 attacks, Fox topped the cable-news ratings, and its competitors played catch-up. \uc2 CNN\uc2 , in a series of identity crises, remade and remade itself. MSNBC went through a feeble, post-9/11 phase as a conservative-talk network, a Fox Jr., before becoming a wonky, progressive anti-Fox.\par \par \uc2 Other news media become more Fox-like, more willing to accept the proposition that everyone has a point of view, and might as well embrace it. Fox didn't cause that alone -- talk radio came before, the multiplicity of online outlets after -- but it provided one model.\par \par \uc2 Fox News became a dressing room in which conservatism could try on new outfits. During the early Obama and Tea Party years, Glenn Beck burned brightly and briefly, with his end-times histrionics and a penchant for conspiracy theories that foreshadowed the current \uc2 election\uc2  cycle.\par \par \uc2 And candidates lined up for appearances -- what was called the ''Fox primary.'' It was a revolving door of politicians who become contributors who become candidates: \uc2 Mike Huckabee\uc2 , \uc2 Newt Gingrich\uc2 , \uc2 Sarah Palin\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Now, as my colleague Jim Rutenberg noted, Mr. Ailes's downfall comes as the Fox ethos has its apotheosis in the Republican nominee, \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , a being made of pure television. Fox News didn't make Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  single-handedly. But it made the conditions that made him.\par \par \uc2 Resentment politics, for instance. Mr. Ailes, and thus Fox, recognized that an aggrieved group needed constant grievance, even in victory. Take the ''War on Christmas,'' which was fought annually on Fox.\par \par \uc2 It became a throwaway line for Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  -- people would say ''Merry Christmas'' in his America, by God! But the spirit of the war on Christmas is everywhere in his campaign. It's in the idea of the fallen majority -- that your thing (religious, racial, whatever) used to be the main thing in America, it used to be honored, and now it's overwhelmed and disrespected, but we are going to bring it back.\par \par \uc2 ''Anchor babies.'' The ''Ground Zero mosque.'' Birtherism. All these themes were test-marketed on Fox, and embraced in the subculture of the Republican base, before Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  adopted them. Note by note, the channel built the instrument that Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  plays like a concert pianist.\par \par \uc2 Beyond that, Fox bolstered the powerful idea, key to his campaign, that traditional gatekeepers and claims to expertise were illegitimate. ''Fair and balanced,'' after all, implied that no one else was balanced, and thus any other information could be dismissed. Newspapers, scientists, egghead fact-checkers -- forget them. There was only Fox.\par \par \uc2 This gave Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , with his tendency to improvise his own facts, an assist -- and, when he briefly went to war against Fox News and its anchor Megyn Kelly during the primary, a weapon. When he delegitimized Fox to his followers, there was no countervailing authority left. Now there was only \uc2 Trump\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Today Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  is at peace with Fox, because he won. And with Mr. Ailes gone, the populist political-media spirit we've come to associate with Fox News may pass to \uc2 Trump\uc2 . (Completing the circle-of-life motif, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's campaign is reported to be overtly modeling itself on the very 1968 ''law-and-order'' campaign that Mr. Ailes helped win for Mr. Nixon.)\par \par \uc2 Fox News after Mr. Ailes may remain a conservative destination. If nothing else, it still has a big audience. But Mr. Murdoch's children don't seem politically driven like Mr. Ailes, so the channel may never again be the same kind of singular, personally driven force.\par \par \uc2 Of course, someone else's media entity might be. There has been speculation, should Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  lose in November, that he might start his own media organization.\par \par \uc2 And if he wins, he'll be a media conglomerate in himself.\par \par \uc2 One way or the other, for better or worse, he would be part of Mr. Ailes's legacy.\par \par \uc2 Roger Ailes at Fox News in 2002. Over two decades, he created a style that influences today's media, recognizing that TV and politics fed off the same energy.

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 To the Editor:\par \par \uc2 Re ''Cruz Stirs Convention Fury in Pointed Snub of \uc2 Trump\uc2 '' (front page, July 21):\par \par \uc2 You reap what you sow. Decades of appealing to Christian conservatives, while also slyly dog-whistling to bigots, produced the inevitable clash between these two factions that exploded at the Republican convention on Wednesday night.\par \par \uc2 Ted Cruz should at least be applauded for standing by his religious convictions. No one, however, could be certain that it was religious conviction, rather than political calculation, that motivated Mr. Cruz not to endorse his party's nominee.\par \par \uc2 This is more than could be said for a number of Christian evangelical leaders who have displayed their hypocrisy by coming out for \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2 . So the G.O.P. is left with a splintered party whose leader seems to be primarily interested in glorifying himself without offering the barest hint of how he will lead the nation.\par \par \uc2 Beginning with Richard Nixon, the G.O.P. has been consistently appealing to Americans' basest instincts. If the party receives a drubbing this November, justice will have been served.\par \par \uc2 DAVID KUZIEMKO\par \par \uc2 Sterling Heights, Mich.\par \par \uc2 To the Editor:\par \par \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  tells us that he should be president because he's such a great negotiator and he always wins. And yet he failed to wring an endorsement from Senator Ted Cruz before agreeing to give Mr. Cruz a prime-time speaking slot at the Republican convention, with predictable and unfortunate results (at least for Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 ). It sure doesn't seem as if the Donald ''won'' with regard to this particular deal.\par \par \uc2 JONATHAN ENGEL\par \par \uc2 New York\par \par \uc2 To the Editor:\par \par \uc2 Re ''Convention Speeches Unsettle Blacks in G.O.P.'' (front page, July 20):\par \par \uc2 ''Make America White Again.'' That's the real message of the Republican convention.\par \par \uc2 DIANNE SELDITCH\par \par \uc2 Norwalk, Conn.\par \par \uc2 To the Editor:\par \par \uc2 Re ''From Links to Lucifer to Calls for Execution, Republicans Seethe at \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 '' (nytimes.com, July 20):\par \par \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2 , by not condemning the words of his followers who would like to see \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  incarcerated or executed, is complicit in this dangerous insanity created by both his own vitriolic accusations and those of his campaign staff in their relentless rants portraying Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  as the devil incarnate who must be stopped at all costs in order to preserve our democracy and ''make America great again.'' I know that I am not alone in fearing for the security of Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 LORI PEARSON WISE\par \par \uc2 Winter Park, Fla.\par \par \uc2 To the Editor:\par \par \uc2 This article reveals the callousness of a significant part of the Republican Party. Franklin D. Roosevelt faced similar antipathy from the same party in 1936, and \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  should consider repeating his response made in a speech at Madison Square Garden on Oct. 31 of that year: ''They are unanimous in their hate for me -- and I welcome their hatred.'' I am sure her speechwriters will provide proper attribution if she does so.\par \par \uc2 WILLIAM G. O'NEILL\par \par \uc2 Brooklyn\par \par \uc2 To the Editor:\par \par \uc2 Re ''Pence's Record on Education in Indiana Is One of Turmoil and Mixed Results'' (news article, July 20):\par \par \uc2 In a toxic and unpredictable \uc2 election\uc2  cycle, \uc2 Gov. Mike Pence\uc2 's record on education is exactly what we need: a reminder that education is the essential lever to expand opportunity for all Americans.\par \par \uc2 People on both the left and the right are taking issue with Mr. Pence's record on education. But the reality is that he pushed forward advances in charter schools and vouchers, testing and preschool, all the while battling a state superintendent backed by the unions.\par \par \uc2 As a nonpartisan organization, the Center for Education Reform does not endorse candidates, but will always recognize and applaud those who advance sound education policies. Mr. Pence is a true pioneer of educational opportunity, with a record that shows he has what it takes to champion policies that move the needle on education opportunity for all.\par \par \uc2 JEANNE ALLEN\par \par \uc2 Founder and Chief Executive\par \par \uc2 The Center for Education Reform\par \par \uc2 Washington\par \par \uc2 To the Editor:\par \par \uc2 In ''Running Mate May Free \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's Hand'' (news article, July 19), you write, ''By choosing someone so conventional, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  has made it easier for Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  to follow suit with an unadventurous pick of her own.''\par \par \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  is a brilliant, impassioned and visionary woman. The last thing she needs is to be advised to go bland. Many are waiting for her to be unleashed to be herself, to be freed to inspire, especially given the dominant and celebrity persona of her Republican opponent. The Democratic ticket needs to ratchet up its ''X factor'' wattage, not tone it down further.\par \par \uc2 A bland running mate will have the opposite effect. If \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  can be nominated for president, why not Bill Gates or Tim Cook or Sheryl Sandberg or Bill Moyers or Jon Stewart or \uc2 Oprah Winfrey\uc2  or Howard Dean for \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's No. 2? Really.\par \par \uc2 SUSAN EISNER\par \par \uc2 New York\par \par \uc2 To the Editor:\par \par \uc2 Re ''For Trusted \uc2 Trump\uc2  Tower Insider, Longtime Passion for Writing Leads Into a Storm'' (news article, July 21):\par \par \uc2 I don't believe the speechwriter's claim that she wrote down passages from Michelle Obama's 2008 speech that were read to her by Melania \uc2 Trump\uc2  and then included them in a draft speech. If the \uc2 Trump\uc2  organization was going to make the speechwriter the fall guy, it should have offered a more plausible explanation for what occurred.\par \par \uc2 LOLITA BUCKNER INNISS\par \par \uc2 Shaker Heights, Ohio\par \par \uc2 Document NYTF000020160722ec7m00038\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw272\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4080\pichgoal600

\par\par \b \uc2 Trump\uc2  Makes His Case --- Fiery Speech Targets Democratic Rival\b0\par\par\uc2 By Janet Hook and Rebecca Ballhaus   \par \uc2 996 \uc2 words\par \uc2 22 July 2016\par \uc2 The Wall Street Journal\par \uc2 J\par A1\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  ended his party's convention Thursday the way he began his history-making campaign: attacking the political establishment, playing to voters' fears of foreigners and crime, and making bold promises to fix America's ills.\par \par \uc2 "I have joined the political arena so that the powerful can no longer beat up on people who cannot defend themselves," said the first-time politician whose populist message helped him capture the Republican presidential nomination.\par \par \uc2 The speech, which ran more than an hour, painted a grim view of the U.S. economy and world affairs under President \uc2 Barack Obama\uc2 , and intensified the attack the record of his rival \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 "This is the legacy of \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 : death, destruction, terrorism and weakness," he said.\par \par \uc2 He returned to familiar campaign themes of opposing international trade deals and cracking down on illegal immigration. He drew strong applause when he reiterated his desire to ban immigrants from nations "compromised by terrorism," and departed from his prepared text to say, "We don't want them in our country."\par \par \uc2 He homed in on Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , the one issue sure to galvanize Republicans in November. Arguing that her tenure as secretary of state under Mr. Obama fomented instability abroad, he said, "America is far less safe -- and the world is far less stable -- than when Obama made the decision to put \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  in charge of America's foreign policy," he said. "I am certain it is a decision President \uc2 Barack Obama\uc2  truly regrets."\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's speech was the capstone of a tumultuous convention that exposed some of the risks he faces as he takes his unorthodox campaign into a general \uc2 election\uc2  campaign against Democratic rival \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's well-funded and well-oiled machine.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  presented himself as uniquely equipped to lead the nation.\par \par \uc2 "Nobody knows the system better than me, which is why I alone can fix it," he said.\par \par \uc2 Citing recent episodes of gun violence and attacks on police officers, he put fresh emphasis on law and order.\par \par \uc2 "Beginning on January 20th of 2017, safety will be restored," he said. "The first task for our new administration will be to liberate our citizens from the crime and terrorism and lawlessness that threaten our communities."\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's message has been honed before oversize crowds on the primary campaign trail. It's less clear how it will play in a tough general \uc2 election\uc2  ahead with a broader audience of swing voters. Testing that was one of the chief convention goals, along with trying to unite the party and broaden Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's personal profile.\par \par \uc2 The stakes for Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's speech rose in the wake of the missteps that marred the first days of the convention: the repeated passages in Melania \uc2 Trump\uc2 's speech from one delivered eight years earlier by Michelle Obama, a divisive fight over convention rules, and the chaos that erupted after Texas Sen. Ted Cruz's refused to endorse Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  during a prime-time address Wednesday.\par \par \uc2 "If you can't run a convention, how is he going to run a State Department, or the Pentagon?" said Rick Tyler, former aide to the Cruz presidential campaign. "The dominant message coming out of the convention is 'You may not like \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2 , but he is not \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 .' If that's the dominant message, we've already lost."\par \par \uc2 Trump\uc2  allies dismiss the long-term significance of the tumult surrounding Mr. Cruz's actions, saying the nominee may have been strengthened because of the backlash against the Texas senator. "The person who shrinks after last night is Cruz not \uc2 Trump\uc2 ," said former House Speaker \uc2 Newt Gingrich\uc2 , who said the choice of Indiana Gov. Mike Pence as \uc2 Trump\uc2 's running mate should help build bridges to disaffected conservatives.\par \par \uc2 Gabriel N. Schwartz, a \uc2 Trump\uc2  supporter from Colorado, said he was confident that most Cruz dissidents are in the minority of the party and that Republicans will come around to vote \uc2 Trump\uc2  in November. "What the convention doesn't do to unify the GOP, \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  will,"" he said.\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 Trump\uc2  campaign used the GOP convention to showcase his family, which is considered one of his biggest assets -- and a potential antidote to one of his biggest political liabilities as he scores particularly low with women voters.\par \par \uc2 The latest Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll found that among suburban women, a key swing voting bloc, 66% say they would be pessimistic or uncertain if he were elected president; among independents, it is 73%.\par \par \uc2 His wife, sons and daughters all tried to present a softer image of Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 . And the appearance of his eldest daughter on the final night was intended to signal to young women that the businessman wants everyone to succeed.\par \par \uc2 In her introduction of her father, \uc2 Ivanka \uc2 Trump\uc2  sought to counter suggestions that he is a sexist, saying that he believes in wage equality and that there are more female than male executives in his company. "He hires the best person for the job. Period," said Ms. \uc2 Trump\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Yet the speeches by the \uc2 Trump\uc2  family offered only brief testimonials to their father's personal attributes before launching into themes that echoed his addresses at rallies.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  has relied heavily on his family as advisers and surrogates; Mr. Gingrich and New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie are Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's most reliable outside advisers. But if their speeches are any indication, most of the party's heavy hitters are less inclined to make a robust case for Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  than they are to make the case against Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 House Speaker \uc2 Paul Ryan\uc2  devoted more time to advancing his conservative vision for the party than to promoting Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's virtues. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell mentioned Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  just five times and Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  more than a dozen times.\par \par \uc2 ---\par \par \uc2 Beth Reinhard\uc2  contributed to this article.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=wjco20160722000141"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document J000000020160722ec7m0003m\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw272\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4080\pichgoal600

\par\par \b \uc2 U.S. News: Sen. Kaine Seen as \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's VP Pick --- Virginian with Spanish skills and low-key style could aid Democrat in the general \uc2 election\b0\par\par\uc2 By Peter Nicholas and Laura Meckler   \par \uc2 707 \uc2 words\par \uc2 22 July 2016\par \uc2 The Wall Street Journal\par \uc2 J\par A2\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  is on the verge of announcing her vice-presidential pick, with Democrats familiar with her search believing she will settle on a Spanish-speaking ally from a battleground state: Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia.\par \par \uc2 Two other candidates also were considered until the end -- Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack, a former Iowa governor, and \uc2 Sen. Cory Booker\uc2  of New Jersey, people familiar with the process said. The \uc2 Clinton\uc2  campaign declined to comment.\par \par \uc2 Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  is likely to announce her selection Friday in the form of a text message to supporters. On Saturday, she is set to campaign in Florida, a potential stage for a joint appearance with her newly minted running mate.\par \par \uc2 Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  and her allies have long said that her top considerations for a vice-presidential pick are a good governing partner and someone who could step into the job of president if needed. Democrats familiar with her thinking say she believes Mr. Kaine passes those tests.\par \par \uc2 Voters tend to focus on the top of the ticket, but Mr. Kaine could offer a political boostfor the \uc2 Clinton\uc2  campaign. Though unflashy by his own admission, his Spanish fluency might be able to cement her lead among Hispanic voters, a key general-\uc2 election\uc2  constituency. He is considered a loyal figure who would mesh well with Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's leadership style.\par \par \uc2 Geography may be another Kaine selling point.\par \par \uc2 Former President \uc2 Bill \uc2 Clinton\uc2  believes that if his wife wins Virginia, the Republican ticket has virtually no realistic path to the 270 Electoral College votes needed to win, a person familiar with his thinking said. In presidential elections dating to 2000, the candidate who won Virginia went on to win the White House.\par \par \uc2 A look at the electoral map shows that if Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  wins Virginia, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  could lose the \uc2 election\uc2  even if he captured Florida and Ohio, assuming Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  holds other battleground states won by \uc2 Barack Obama\uc2  in his two presidential bids.\par \par \uc2 Another person close to Mr. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  said Mr. Kaine is the former president's top choice.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Kaine, though, is no hero to the Democratic Party's liberal wing. Last year, he voted to give the president "fast track" authority considered necessary to eventually approve a controversial 12-nation Pacific trade pact called the Trans-Pacific Partnership. Free-trade pacts are anathema to some in the Democratic base. Mr. Kaine has staked out a more moderate position that says such deals can help the economy if negotiated in ways that protect workers' rights.\par \par \uc2 If elected vice president, Mr. Kaine's replacement in the Senate would be selected by a Democratic governor. That isn't the case with three other people Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  considered: Sens. Booker, Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Sherrod Brown of Ohio.\par \par \uc2 Under Virginia law, \uc2 Gov. Terry McAuliffe\uc2 , a longtime \uc2 Clinton\uc2  ally, would name a temporary replacement for Mr. Kaine, while the remainder of his term would be filled througha special \uc2 election\uc2  in November 2017.\par \par \uc2 Labor Secretary Tom Perez also was in the running but fell out of the top tier of contenders, one person familiar with the matter said.\par \par \uc2 Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  repeated this week that her top criterion for the position is someone who can fill the president's job. "You know, I am afflicted with the responsibility gene, and I know what it's like being president," she said in an interview with Charlie Rose.\par \par \uc2 Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  gave no hint in the interview of whom she favored, but offered her take on several people being considered. Asked about the perception that Mr. Kaine is "too boring," she said that was a plus: "I love that about him." She added that he has never lost an \uc2 election\uc2  and was a "world-class mayor, governor and senator."\par \par \uc2 Democratic consultant Steve Elmendorf said \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2 's choice of Indiana Gov. Mike Pence as a running mate allowed Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  more flexibility. If Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  had picked \uc2 Newt Gingrich\uc2 , a sharp debater, she might have wanted to ensure her choice was ready to face him.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=wjco20160722000115"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document J000000020160722ec7m0002w\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw272\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4080\pichgoal600

He attacked Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  because she was secretary of state during the Sept. 11, 2012, attacks in Benghazi, Libya, and then criticized his Democratic challenger, former Sen. Russ Feingold, for being the only senator to vote against the 2001 Patriot Act.\par \par \uc2 "The world is simply too dangerous to elect either of them," Mr. Johnson said.\par \par \uc2 -- Siobhan Hughes\par \par \uc2 ---\par \par \uc2 TWITTER\uc2  PURCHASE\par \par \uc2 Trump\uc2  Gets Hashtag\par \par \uc2 Ahead of \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2 's speech on the last day of the Republican convention, the \uc2 Trump\uc2  campaign purchased \uc2 Twitter\uc2 's promoted hashtag on Thursday, a more than six-figure ad buy, according to a Twitter spokesman.\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 Trump\uc2  campaign's choice of hashtag was prominently displayed to all U.S. Twitter users on the website and mobile app.\par \par \uc2 -- Natalie Andrews\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=wjco20160722000106"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document J000000020160722ec7m0002n\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw272\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4080\pichgoal600

\par\par \b \uc2 The Republican Convention: \uc2 NATO\uc2  Responds to \uc2 Trump\b0\par\par\uc2 By Paul Sonne   \par \uc2 519 \uc2 words\par \uc2 22 July 2016\par \uc2 The Wall Street Journal\par \uc2 J\par A7\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 WASHINGTON -- The head of the \uc2 North Atlantic Treaty Organization\uc2  took the unusual step of wading into the U.S. presidential campaign on Thursday after Republican nominee \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  rekindled a foreign policy debate by saying the U.S. may not come to the aid of alliance members if they are attacked by Russia.\par \par \uc2 "I will not interfere in the U.S. \uc2 election\uc2  campaign, but what I can do is say what matters for \uc2 NATO\uc2 ," NATO Secretary General \uc2 Jens Stoltenberg\uc2  said. "Solidarity among allies is a key value for \uc2 NATO\uc2 ."\par \par \uc2 Without mentioning Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  by name, Mr. Stoltenberg said alliance members "defend one another."\par \par \uc2 Article 5 of the 1949 treaty that established \uc2 NATO\uc2  stipulates that an attack on one member represents an attack on all and requires the alliance to come to the defense of any country attacked.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's campaign didn't respond Thursday to a request for comment.\par \par \uc2 In an interview with the \uc2 New York Times\uc2 , Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  questioned the collective defense provisions of the \uc2 NATO\uc2  treaty on monetary grounds, saying that many members weren't paying their fair share. He told the newspaper that if Russia attacked the Baltic States, which are \uc2 NATO\uc2  members, he would decide whether to defend them only after reviewing "if they have fulfilled their obligations to us."\par \par \uc2 Such a change in policy would put the alliance into question and fundamentally rewrite the rules of European security that have been in place since the end of World War II.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's campaign didn't respond Thursday to a request for comment.\par \par \uc2 The White House said that President \uc2 Barack Obama\uc2  has an "ironclad" commitment to \uc2 NATO\uc2  allies. "There should be no mistake or miscalculation made about this country's commitment to our trans-Atlantic alliance," said \uc2 Josh Earnest\uc2 , Mr. Obama's spokesman.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's comments prompted an outcry from politicians and policy experts on both sides of the aisle, who warned that the U.S. couldn't go back on its word.\par \par \uc2 "Statements like these make the world more dangerous and the U.S. less safe," \uc2 Sen. Lindsey Graham\uc2  (R., S.C.) said in a statement, adding they would make Russian President \uc2 Vladimir Putin\uc2  "a very happy man."\par \par \uc2 Sen. Ben Sasse (R., Neb.), a critic of Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , said the U.S. stands with its allies in \uc2 NATO\uc2 . "Our friends should draw strength and our adversaries should take pause from this simple fact: Americans keep our word," he said.\par \par \uc2 At the Republican National Convention in Cleveland, some lawmakers who said they plan to vote for Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  criticized his comments on \uc2 NATO\uc2 , including Rep. Bill Huizenga (R., Mich.).\par \par \uc2 "I wholeheartedly reject that," he said. "We have a treaty, we have an obligation."\par \par \uc2 A senior policy adviser to \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , the presumptive Democratic nominee, said Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's comments on \uc2 NATO\uc2  show he is "temperamentally unfit and fundamentally ill-prepared to be our commander-in-chief."\par \par \uc2 ---\par \par \uc2 Julian E. Barnes in Brussels, Damian Paletta in Washington and Kristina Peterson in Cleveland contributed to this article.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=wjco20160722000102"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document J000000020160722ec7m0002j\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

The recent police killings of Alton Sterling and Philando Castile, along with attacks on police officers in Dallas and Baton Rouge, loomed. All the presumed mayhem needed was a soundtrack.\par \par \uc2 Enter Prophets of Rage.\par \par \uc2 Featuring members of two of the most incendiary (and best-selling) protest acts of the '80s and '90s -- Public Enemy and Rage Against the Machine -- plus the sly rapper B-Real of Cypress Hill, the band formed this \uc2 election\uc2  year with the announcement: ''Dangerous times demand dangerous songs.''\par \par \uc2 After a few warm-up shows, the rap-rock band's coming out party was planned for the Republican convention, where they were armed with music from the bruising catalogs of all three groups.\par \par \uc2 ''There needs to be a countervailing voice on the streets of Cleveland,'' said the guitarist and the band's de facto leader, Tom Morello.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Morello and his longtime Rage Against the Machine bandmates, the drummer Brad Wilk and the bassist Tim Commerford, have a colorful history at these events: Known for its guerrilla performance tactics, the group appeared at the 2000 Democratic convention and 2008 Republican convention. Each event ended in clashes with police.\par \par \uc2 Today, artists kicking around in political waters are more likely to make waves online using social media, and more likely to gain viral attention with an unexpected political quip at an opportune moment.\par \par \uc2 Prophets of Rage represent a dying breed: a dedicated protest act from a previous era at a time when pop music is not exactly known for its revolutionary spirit.\par \par \uc2 These are scenes from their time on the ground in Cleveland.\par \par \uc2 Monday, 1 p.m., The Agora Theater\par \par \uc2 The members of Prophets of Rage sit on a sagging couch and unglamorous folding chairs backstage as they plot various appearances throughout the day: a daytime concert for End Poverty Now in an undeveloped lot, a march from there toward the convention (or as close as the police barricades will allow) and a surprise appearance, with bullhorns and a boombox, at the Public Square plaza downtown.\par \par \uc2 The Battle of Cleveland: Prophets Of Rage vs The \uc2 RNC\uc2  cont.

But Mr. Morello, in a \uc2 Trump\uc2 -red ''Make America Rage Again'' hat, is realistic about the potential for impact.\par \par \uc2 ''What if the crowd is thin?'' someone asks.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Morello replies: ''If it's thin, we'll make our own mosh pit.''\par \par \uc2 Nor does he care that other brand-name performers seem to be absent for the proceedings.\par \par \uc2 ''It's not my job to look around and see what bands I might convince to come play a show,'' Mr. Morello, 52, says, adding that he preferred to ''fire up people who have convictions but are not motivated yet to express them in their political life.''\par \par \uc2 In lieu of more youthful musical upstarts, the often thankless job of marching and shouting will be left to stalwart activists like him and Chuck D of Public Enemy.\par \par \uc2 ''Youthful energy is a wonderful thing but it has to be coached,'' Chuck D, 55, says. ''Our job is to guide the energy.'' He is tending to a sore neck with a pain patch.\par \par \uc2 Monday, 3 p.m., End Poverty Now Rally\par \par \uc2 ''Hello Cleveland,'' Mr. Morello shouts from the stage. ''Thank you for coming out today with your joy and your militancy.''\par \par \uc2 His guitar reads ''Arm the Homeless,'' matching the provocative signs in the crowd of a few hundred people: ''Mein \uc2 Trump\uc2 ,'' ''America Was Never Great,'' ''We Need to Overthrow the System.''\par \par \uc2 At the empty field about three miles from the convention, a man in military fatigues rocks out alongside Code Pink protesters and bouncing shirtless men. ''Y'all feel powerful or what?'' B-Real asks from the stage.\par \par \uc2 After an abbreviated set, the band helps lead the march deeper into downtown, pausing along the route to take selfies with fans. The two-mile walk is peaceful and orderly. But Mr. Commerford, the bassist, summoning his past confrontational spirit, stares down the heavily armored police officers biking alongside the protest. He carries a sign reading ''I'm an anticapitalist anarchist and I love you!''\par \par \uc2 Protesters block traffic as they march toward GOP convention. Now about a half mile away. Large police presence. pic.twitter.com/36u5WHOokR -- Jacob Rascon (@Jacobnbc) July 18, 2016\par \par \uc2 Back in the van afterward, Mr. Morello can't help but rave. ''You mad-dogged 75 'Ninja Turtle' death troopers by yourself!'' he says. ''You showed them what a real soldier is.''\par \par \uc2 Monday, 5:45 p.m., Public Square\par \par \uc2 Having separated from the march, there is some fretting about the size of the scattered crowd at the plaza. But a representative for the band tells Mr. Morello that a group of about 30 from the protest is on its way.\par \par \uc2 ''Those 30 will be all we need,'' he says, grinning. ''Jesus had 11.''\par \par \uc2 From behind barricades demarking a free-speech zone, where anyone can sign up for a 30-minute slot at the microphone, Prophets of Rage run through a lo-fi, boombox-led medley of its protest songs, including ''Can't Truss It'' and ''Killing in the Name.'' About 100 onlookers bob their heads and occasionally raise fists in solidarity.\par \par \uc2 Monday, 9:30 p.m., At an Art Gallery\par \par \uc2 Once again unannounced, Mr. Morello appears with an acoustic guitar at a small art space on the second floor of a darkened shopping mall. ''The struggle continues,'' he says.\par \par \uc2 Taking the stage amid tables of punk zines and homemade patches for a crowd of a few dozen, he acknowledges that the performance was ''kind of a preaching to the choir show'' but nonetheless leads the audience in a passionate rendition of Woody Guthrie's ''This Land Is Your Land.'' He urges fans to put their phones down and live in the moment. People do.\par \par \uc2 Tuesday, 6 p.m., Back at Agora\par \par \uc2 After an afternoon of on-camera interviews, the band members rest before their show at the theater. Fans are already lined up outside.\par \par \uc2 Despite only modest crowds at the protests and the lack of any real contact with Republicans, Mr. Morello remains steadfast in his enthusiasm and positive messaging.\par \par \uc2 ''It's a very, very short list of people who have it in their DNA and in their soul to show up for daily grass-roots activism,'' he says, commending his bandmates in Prophets of Rage for their willingness to touch pavement. ''These guys are willing to show up.''\par \par \uc2 Still, during a down moment backstage, he sighs: ''Saving democracy is not an easy business.''\par \par \uc2 Neither is commanding attention. At a simultaneous charity show at the nearby Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, the largely apolitical pop group Third Eye Blind lights up \uc2 Twitter\uc2  with its adversarial remarks to the Republicans in the crowd.\par \par \uc2 Third Eye Blind tonite at #RNCinCLE event: We believe in tolerance, acceptance (Followed by boos) pic.twitter.com/WPRIEMZmEp -- Tina (@tinpant) July 20, 2016\par \par \uc2 ''Raise your hand if you believe in science,'' the band's lead singer, Stephan Jenkins, says, drawing boos -- but ultimately also plaudits and headlines for his flash of punk spirit.\par \par \uc2 Prophets of Rage, meanwhile, face an entirely friendly room eager to mosh and scream along to aggressive anti-establishment songs written two decades ago.\par \par \uc2 Taking the stage, fists up, to the sound of a siren, Chuck D announces that Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  was just formally nominated as the Republican presidential candidate. The crowd responds with all it can at the moment, raising middle fingers to the sky.\par \par \uc2 Correction: July 26, 2016, Tuesday\par \par \uc2 This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: A picture caption on Thursday with an article about protests by musicians at the Republican National Convention referred incorrectly to the performer Chuck D. He is a member of Public Enemy, not a former member.\par \par \uc2 Top, concertgoers watch a performance by Prophets of Rage at a hall near the Republican National Convention.

Ted Cruz refused to endorse \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  on Wednesday night, leaving delegates at the Republican National Convention shouting angrily, and laying bare the rift between traditional conservatives and the populist candidate.\par \par \uc2 In a dramatic prime-time address the day after Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  officially won the nomination, the Texas senator congratulated Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  by name for the victory and then never mentioned him again, drawing boos as he concluded his speech.\par \par \uc2 The episode laid bare fissures that have complicated the \uc2 Trump\uc2  campaign's efforts to broaden his appeal and unify the party behind him before entering what's expected to be a brutal general \uc2 election\uc2  against Democrat \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 It came after the collapse on Monday of the stop-\uc2 Trump\uc2  movement that had spent months trying to upend Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's nomination. While Mr. Cruz never directly participated in or blessed that campaign, it was orchestrated at every stage by his supporters.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Cruz's prime speaking spot was offered to him -- the longest time allotment of any of Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's GOP rivals -- to try to defuse the intraparty fight. The dramatic refusal by Mr. Cruz to fulfill the Republican candidates' pledge to back the primary victor, a man who insulted his family and offended his conservative principles, is likely to propel Mr. Cruz's standing among many movement advocates.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , on \uc2 Twitter\uc2 , reacted to Mr. Cruz's snub by saying, "wow, Ted Cruz got booed off the stage." The nominee said he'd learned two hours earlier that the senator wasn't going to endorse him, "but let him speak anyway."\par \par \uc2 The closest Mr. Cruz came to an endorsement was a bland exhortation to vote. "Please, don't stay home in November," Mr. Cruz said. "Stand, and speak, and vote your conscience, vote for candidates up and down the ticket who you trust to defend our freedom and to be faithful to the Constitution."\par \par \uc2 The crowd roared. But as Mr. Cruz wound down his speech and it became clear there was no forthcoming \uc2 Trump\uc2  endorsement, many in the crowd started chanting, "\uc2 Trump\uc2 , \uc2 Trump\uc2 , \uc2 Trump\uc2 !" Others started booing the Texan. Entire sections shook their heads in disappointment.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  created his own distraction toward the end of Mr. Cruz's speech. Knowing Mr. Cruz had no plans to back him, he stepped into view, drawing the sights of cameras across the arena, as the Texan concluded his remarks.\par \par \uc2 "Sore loser," Joe Mathis, a 68-year-old delegate from Alaska said of Mr. Cruz, as he leaned over to the woman seated next to him. "Ted Cruz had a chance to bring the party together," he said. "It's a shame. It didn't help the party."\par \par \uc2 Mr. Cruz's speech brought furious criticism from some of Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's big supporters. Former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee called it a "betrayal" on \uc2 Facebook\uc2 . Retired Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn, on \uc2 Twitter\uc2 , said, "tonight Ted Cruz demonstrated he is willing to place self before country."\par \par \uc2 New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, on ABC television, called the speech "awful" and "selfish."\par \par \uc2 Former Florida Sen. George LeMieux, who backed Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's defeated rivals Jeb Bush and \uc2 Sen. Marco Rubio\uc2  before endorsing Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , said Mr. Cruz should have offered an endorsement.\par \par \uc2 "It's amazing to me that Ted Cruz would come to \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2 's convention and be given the privilege of speaking and not endorse him," Mr. LeMieux said. "He really hurt himself tonight with the grass roots."\par \par \uc2 Mr. Cruz's refusal to back Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  comes 10 weeks after the end of a bitter primary battle between the two, in which Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  christened him "Lyin' Ted," mocked his wife's appearance and accused Mr. Cruz's father of having complicity in the assassination of President John F. Kennedy.\par \par \uc2 Before he suspended his campaign in May, Mr. Cruz slammed Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  as a "pathological liar." Neither man has recanted their description of the other.\par \par \uc2 While Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's supporters have called for the GOP to unite behind him, Mr. Cruz told the convention hall that the onus is on Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  to do the uniting.\par \par \uc2 "We deserve leaders who stand for principle," he said. "Unite us all behind shared values. Cast aside anger for love. That is the standard we should expect, from everybody."\par \par \uc2 Mr. Cruz's remarks marked the convention's most electric moment, calling for the Republican Party to adhere to his brand of conservative values -- an implicit criticism of Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's populism.\par \par \uc2 The Texas senator's rebuke of the party's nominee came after Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's aides spent recent days hinting to reporters that they should expect Mr. Cruz to finally endorse Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Wednesday night's scene left the two men no closer to an endorsement, even though many of Mr. Cruz's supporters are now backing the nominee. Several delegates on the convention floor held signs that read "Cruz delegate for \uc2 Trump\uc2 ."\par \par \uc2 Matt Schultz, the former Iowa secretary of state who was the chairman of Mr. Cruz's Iowa campaign, said he is backing Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  and expects most of the Cruz coalition to do so, too, eventually.\par \par \uc2 ---\par \par \uc2 Ben Kesling and Beth Reinhard contributed to this article.\par \par \uc2 (See related letters: "Letters to the Editor: Cruz, Honor, Unity and the Fragmented GOP" -- WSJ July 25, 2016)\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=wjco20160721000127"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document J000000020160721ec7l000bp\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 National Desk; SECTA\par \b \uc2 The \uc2 Clinton\uc2  Campaign; 'Sophistication' Stalled by Primary Fight, Ex-Obama Aide Says\b0\par\par\uc2 By ALEX THOMPSON \par \uc2 293 \uc2 words\par \uc2 21 July 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 14\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 CLEVELAND -- \uc2 David Plouffe\uc2 , above, President Obama's former campaign manager and senior adviser, said Wednesday that because of the long primary contest against Senator Bernie Sanders, \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's campaign did not yet have the ''sophistication'' of Mr. Obama's re-\uc2 election\uc2  infrastructure.\par \par \uc2 At a Bloomberg Politics luncheon here, Mr. Plouffe -- who now works for Uber -- said that the \uc2 Clinton\uc2  campaign could still catch up to Mr. Obama's 2012 team, which, with no primary opponent, had more time to construct a voter model that precisely targeted voter preferences across several swing states. Mr. Plouffe stressed that such a model needed to be ''perfect'' because campaigns ''make every decision based on your model these days,'' not on polls.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Plouffe also said that Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  ''suffers from an enthusiasm problem, it's real,'' but that Mr. Obama's increasing job approval would help her. It is up to her, however, to ''close the sale,'' he said.\par \par \uc2 Still, Mr. Plouffe predicted that Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  would almost certainly win the \uc2 election\uc2  because of what he saw as Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's many shortcomings as a candidate. (He put her chances at 99 percent.)\par \par \uc2 ''I think the tragedy for the Republican Party,'' he said, ''is this should have been a competitive race, it could have been a winnable race, that's very clear right now.''\par \par \uc2 A presidential race is the ''most serious thing in the world,'' Mr. Plouffe said, but Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  and his campaign are ''not treating it as such.''\par \par \uc2 ALEX THOMPSON\par \par \uc2 Find out what you need to know about the 2016 presidential race today, and get politics news updates via \uc2 Facebook\uc2 , \uc2 Twitter\uc2  and the First Draft newsletter.\par \par \uc2 Document NYTF000020160722ec7l00016\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 National Desk; SECTA\par \b \uc2 How Pence's Faith Led to the Republican Party\b0\par\par\uc2 By JONATHAN MAHLER and DIRK JOHNSON \par \uc2 1,648 \uc2 words\par \uc2 21 July 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 12\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 When \uc2 Gov. Mike Pence\uc2  of Indiana was in college, he found himself admiring a gold cross hanging from the neck of his fraternity ''big brother.''\par \par \uc2 The response he received left such a powerful impression that he would recall it decades later on the floor of Congress.\par \par \uc2 ''Remember, Mike, you have got to wear it in your heart before you wear it around your neck,'' Mr. Pence said his fraternity brother told him.\par \par \uc2 Soon after this exchange, at a Christian music festival in Kentucky, Mr. Pence took a very different sort of pledge from the one he had taken to join Phi Gamma Delta. ''I gave my life to Jesus Christ,'' he recalled years later, ''and that's changed everything.''\par \par \uc2 It was a decision that would redefine Mr. Pence, setting him on the path to becoming an evangelical Christian and one of the country's most outwardly religious and socially conservative legislators.\par \par \uc2 But it also caused him to break with two institutions that had been central to the Pence family: the Roman Catholic Church and the Democratic Party.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Pence, 57, who accepted the Republican nomination for vice president on Wednesday night, is the only one of six Pence siblings who is no longer part of the Catholic Church. Though the family remains close, his embrace of evangelical Christianity was long a source of disappointment to his mother, according to the Rev. Clement T. Davis, the priest at the church in Columbus, Ind., where Mr. Pence was baptized.\par \par \uc2 The family's Irish Catholic roots run deep. Mr. Pence's maternal grandfather, with whom he was especially close, came to America in 1923 from Ireland and settled in Chicago, where he eventually became a bus driver.\par \par \uc2 The family idolized John F. Kennedy, the nation's first Irish-Catholic president. As a teenager, Mike Pence was the youth coordinator for the Bartholomew County Democrats.\par \par \uc2 All four of the Pence brothers were altar boys at their church, St. Columba, and attended its parochial school. They were at church six days a week, sometimes seven, if they were serving Saturday Mass. Even after they all went off to college, the church would call the Pence house during vacations or over the summer when it was in need of an altar boy.\par \par \uc2 ''Our life revolved around the church,'' Gregory Pence, one of Mr. Pence's two older brothers, said in an interview, adding that he still went to morning Mass there a few times a week with his mother.\par \par \uc2 But at \uc2 Hanover College\uc2 , a small liberal-arts college in Indiana near the banks of the Ohio River, Mr. Pence came to feel that something was missing from his spiritual life. The Catholicism of his youth, with its formality and rituals, had not given him the intimacy with God that he now found himself craving.\par \par \uc2 ''I began to meet young men and women who talked about having a personal relationship with Jesus Christ,'' he said years later in an interview with the \uc2 Christian Broadcasting Network\uc2 . ''That had not been a part of my experience.''\par \par \uc2 Still, it was not easy for him to leave behind the church in which he had been raised. After graduation, he worked as a Catholic youth minister and even considered becoming a priest. He described himself for years as ''an evangelical Catholic.'' Friends say he wrestled with how to square his religious past and his religious future.\par \par \uc2 ''He was part of a movement of people, I'll call it, who had grown up Catholic and still loved many things about the Catholic Church, but also really loved the concept of having a very personal relationship with Christ,'' said Patricia Bailey, who became close to Mr. Pence when she and her husband, Mark, worked with him at a law firm in Indianapolis in the mid-1980s.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Pence's wife, Karen, was also part of that movement. They met when he was in law school at \uc2 Indiana University\uc2 . After they started dating, she bought a gold cross with the word ''Yes'' engraved on it, and kept it in her purse until he proposed.\par \par \uc2 ''She's been very much a part of his faith journey,'' said Mark Bailey, who often started his day by praying with Mr. Pence in one of their offices at the law firm. ''He would refer to his wife as the prayer warrior of the family.''\par \par \uc2 By the mid-1990s, Mr. Pence and his wife were attending an evangelical church in Indianapolis. Years later, the break from Catholicism still stung his mother, Nancy, according to Father Davis, who has been the priest at her church, now called St. Bartholomew, since 1997 and has grown close to her.\par \par \uc2 ''You could see Nancy just shake her head about it,'' Father Davis said inside the rectory before Mass on Saturday. ''She was disappointed. She had hoped he could find his way back to the church.''\par \par \uc2 Others in Columbus who knew the Pence family were also surprised. ''They were just known as such a big Catholic family,'' said Janie Gordon, a friend of Mr. Pence's from high school.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Pence's mother declined to comment. The governor also declined to be interviewed about his conversion, but he authorized his brother to speak about his family's faith.\par \par \uc2 As Mr. Pence's faith was changing, so were his politics. He voted for \uc2 Jimmy Carter\uc2  in 1980 but soon gravitated to Ronald Reagan, and to the Republican Party's staunch opposition to abortion.\par \par \uc2 His evangelical Christianity is now the driving force behind his political agenda, whether he is working to deny federal funds to \uc2 Planned Parenthood\uc2  or to make it legal for religious conservatives to refuse to serve gay couples.\par \par \uc2 ''I sign this law with a prayer that God would continue to bless these precious children, mothers and families,'' he said in March, putting his pen to a sweeping abortion bill prohibiting a woman from aborting a fetus because it has a disability such as Down syndrome. (A federal judge blocked the law last month.)\par \par \uc2 ''Pence doesn't simply wear his faith on his sleeve, he wears the entire Jesus jersey,'' Brian Howey, a political columnist in Indiana, once put it.\par \par \uc2 During Mr. Pence's days on Capitol Hill, he would not attend events without his wife if alcohol was being served. Fellow representatives sometimes joked about the need to clean up their language when he appeared.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Pence would not even engage in attack ads, having sworn off negative campaigning after running a particularly nasty and unsuccessful congressional race earlier in his political career. ''Christ Jesus came to save sinners, among whom I am foremost of all,'' he wrote after the \uc2 election\uc2 , quoting a line from Scripture.\par \par \uc2 When Mr. Pence was in a tight race for governor in 2012, his media strategist, Rex Elsass, invoked a different line from the Bible in an effort to persuade him that attacks from his Democratic opponent justified a direct and forceful response, as long as it was truthful, Mr. Elsass recalled. Mr. Pence refused.\par \par \uc2 In recent days, however, he has not hesitated to hammer \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , the presumptive Democratic nominee: He has called her ''corrupt Hillary,'' mimicking \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's label ''crooked Hillary.''\par \par \uc2 When Mr. Pence returned to his alma mater in 2008 to deliver a commencement address, his speech built toward what he considered to be the most profound experience of his college career.\par \par \uc2 ''There was one other person I met during my years here who changed my life more than all the friends and family combined,'' he said, referring to Jesus Christ. ''Thirty years ago this spring, I embraced the truth,'' he continued, before quoting a verse from Scripture.\par \par \uc2 Today, Mr. Pence and his wife often worship at College Park Church, an evangelical megachurch in Indianapolis with three huge video screens, colored spotlights and Christian bands.\par \par \uc2 On Sunday, the day after Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  formally introduced Mr. Pence as his running mate in Midtown Manhattan, they sat in the balcony of the theater-style auditorium there, standing and clapping in rhythm with the music.\par \par \uc2 Several church members talked about their experiences of deepening their faith in God.\par \par \uc2 There was no talk of Mr. Pence or the \uc2 election\uc2 , but one song, its lyrics flashing across the big screens, encouraged the faithful: ''Set your church on fire, win this nation back.''\par \par \uc2 It was a far cry from the wooden pews and kneelers of St. Columba, the austere Catholic church of Mr. Pence's youth.\par \par \uc2 Gregory Pence said he did not see his brother's turn to evangelical Christianity as a rejection of their Catholicisim, but rather as a reflection of the fact that he had different spiritual needs.\par \par \uc2 The two of them still pray together, just not usually in church. Indeed, Gregory said that when his brother called after learning that Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  had chosen him as his running mate, they wept and swapped verses from Scripture. (''Well done, my good and faithful servant,'' Gregory Pence told his brother.)\par \par \uc2 He declined to say whether he had been supporting Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  before his brother joined the ticket. But asked if he thought his brother might have had some doubts about signing on with a man whose r\u233\'00\'E9sum\u233\'00\'E9 includes three wives and a casino empire, and who liberally invokes coarse language and imagery, he answered without hesitation.\par \par \uc2 ''Judge not lest ye be judged,'' he said.\par \par \uc2 Find out what you need to know about the 2016 presidential race today, and get politics news updates via \uc2 Facebook\uc2 , \uc2 Twitter\uc2  and the First Draft newsletter.\par \par \uc2 The Rev.

\par\par \uc2 National Desk; SECTA\par \b \uc2 Cruz Just Can't Escape \uc2 Trump\uc2 's Shadow\b0\par\par\uc2 By MATT FLEGENHEIMER \par \uc2 949 \uc2 words\par \uc2 21 July 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 14\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 CLEVELAND -- The revelers beamed, embracing like alumni at a high school reunion. The country music blared. The outdoor bar at a restaurant here was open and generously stocked.\par \par \uc2 But as Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, addressing supporters of his presidential bid, turned somberly to the subject of a Republican ''nominee'' he declined to name, the crowd began to boo.\par \par \uc2 Then supporters looked up: Once again, there was no escaping \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2 . His branded jet had just glided past.\par \par \uc2 ''That was pretty well orchestrated!'' Mr. Cruz said, after smiling through the boos.\par \par \uc2 By nightfall, Mr. Cruz earned boos of his own when he refrained from endorsing Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  in his speech at the convention.\par \par \uc2 But at the restaurant Mr. Cruz's performance was playful -- stuffed with movie quotations (from ''Patton''), obscure vocabulary (he wants a ''passel'' of grandchildren) and theatrical pauses that seemed even more pregnant than usual.\par \par \uc2 ''This was a movement,'' he said, cycling through anecdotes from the road ''all across this country.''\par \par \uc2 Among the hundreds gathered were several aides from the campaign, including Rick Tyler, the spokesman Mr. Cruz fired in February for spreading a misleading video about Senator \uc2 Marco Rubio\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Jeff Roe, Mr. Cruz's former campaign manager, held forth with reporters, holding up his cellphone when a call from \uc2 Paul Manafort\uc2 , Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's campaign chairman, came in.\par \par \uc2 When Mr. Cruz said he was not sure what the future held, a chant of ''2020!'' rang out. He smiled.\par \par \uc2 He recalled the night he dropped out after losing the Indiana primary, when he strained to control his emotions for the cameras. ''I wasn't going to let those S.O.B.s turn Lyin' Ted into Cryin' Ted,'' he said.\par \par \uc2 He thanked those gathered and stepped offstage. A band replaced him.\par \par \uc2 ''Where all the Texas folks at?'' a band member asked, as Mr. Cruz reached the deck.\par \par \uc2 Rock 'n' Roll\par \par \uc2 A Whole Lot of (Fist) Shaking Going On\par \par \uc2 Historically, rock 'n' roll has been about challenging authority. The '90s band Third Eye Blind decided to renew that tradition in a big way early Wednesday morning at a convention-related party held, fittingly enough, at the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame and Museum here.\par \par \uc2 Appearing at a charity event to benefit Musicians on Call, the band's frontman, Stephan Jenkins, chose the end of the group's set to urge the Republican Party to become more accepting of gay Americans -- ''like my cousins'' -- and to ''not live your life in fear and imposing that fear on other people.''\par \par \uc2 Needless to say, many of those in the previously festive crowd, nearly all Republicans in town for the convention, were not pleased.\par \par \uc2 Angry boos began to ring out along with shouts of ''\uc2 Trump\uc2 , \uc2 Trump\uc2 , \uc2 Trump\uc2 .'' Some guests screamed obscenities and urged those around them to walk out en masse.\par \par \uc2 There was no encore.\par \par \uc2 The event, produced and sponsored by the \uc2 Recording Industry Association of America\uc2 , was not officially connected with the convention but is one of many invitation-only parties that are held to entertain and build relationships. The recording industry group stages concerts at both conventions to benefit Musicians on Call, which provides live and recorded music to health care facilities.\par \par \uc2 On Wednesday afternoon, the members of Third Eye Blind posted a statement on social media with the subject line, ''About last night.'' They didn't apologize or back down, and said the band repudiates ''every last stitch of the \uc2 RNC\uc2  platform and the grotesque that is their nominee''\par \par \uc2 ''We have Republican friends, family members, and fans, and we love them all,'' the statement said. ''What we reject is what their party has come to stand for.''\par \par \uc2 CARL HULSE\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 Clinton\uc2  Campaign\par \par \uc2 'Sophistication' Stalled By Primary Fight, Ex-Obama Aide Says\par \par \uc2 David Plouffe\uc2 , above, President Obama's former campaign manager and senior adviser, said Wednesday that because of the long primary contest against Senator Bernie Sanders, \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's campaign did not yet have the ''sophistication'' of Mr. Obama's re-\uc2 election\uc2  infrastructure.\par \par \uc2 At a Bloomberg Politics luncheon here, Mr. Plouffe -- who now works for Uber -- said that the \uc2 Clinton\uc2  campaign could still catch up to Mr. Obama's 2012 team, which, with no primary opponent, had more time to construct a voter model that precisely targeted voter preferences across several swing states. Mr. Plouffe stressed that such a model needed to be ''perfect'' because campaigns ''make every decision based on your model these days,'' not on polls.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Plouffe also said that Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  ''suffers from an enthusiasm problem, it's real,'' but that Mr. Obama's increasing job approval would help her. It is up to her, however, to ''close the sale,'' he said.\par \par \uc2 Still, Mr. Plouffe predicted that Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  would almost certainly win the \uc2 election\uc2  because of what he saw as Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's many shortcomings as a candidate. (He put her chances at 99 percent.)\par \par \uc2 ''I think the tragedy for the Republican Party,'' he said, ''is this should have been a competitive race, it could have been a winnable race, that's very clear right now.''\par \par \uc2 A presidential race is the ''most serious thing in the world,'' Mr. Plouffe said, but Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  and his campaign are ''not treating it as such.''\par \par \uc2 ALEX THOMPSON\par \par \uc2 Find out what you need to know about the 2016 presidential race today, and get politics news updates via \uc2 Facebook\uc2 , \uc2 Twitter\uc2  and the First Draft newsletter.\par \par \uc2 This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.\par \par \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's plane landing Wednesday at the Great Lakes Science Center in Cleveland.

\par\par \uc2 Politics; SECT\par \b \uc2 Republican Convention Night 3: What You Missed\b0\par\par\uc2 By NICK CORASANITI and MICHAEL D. SHEAR \par \uc2 1,117 \uc2 words\par \uc2 21 July 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 The New York Times on the Web\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 All eyes were on \uc2 Gov. Mike Pence\uc2  of Indiana as he accepted the vice presidential nomination at the Republican National Convention on Wednesday, its third night, and made the case for \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2  as a Christian and a conservative.\par \par \uc2 Keeping in the line of ''Making America'' something, the night's theme was ''Making America First Again,'' and featured speeches by \uc2 Newt Gingrich\uc2 , the former House speaker; \uc2 Eric \uc2 Trump\uc2 , one of Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's sons; and Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, one of his former rivals.\par \par \uc2 Here are the highlights:\par \par \uc2 If you were waiting for the usual kind of convention speech, you just saw it. Mr. Pence, the nominee for vice president, delivered what may have been the only speech that closely resembled the typical presentation at a nominating convention. He thanked his family, introduced his wife, lauded his ticket-mate, ticked off policy ideas, made a few jokes and expressed optimism about the country and his party's chances to win in November.\par \par \uc2 ''It's change versus the status quo, and when \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  is president, the change will be huge,'' Mr. Pence said. He criticized \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  and the Democratic Party, describing them as ''entrenched in power.'' He closed out Day Three of the convention by declaring: ''We have but one choice'' -- to elect \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  the 45th president.\par \par \uc2 _____\par \par \uc2 After an extended and often soaring speech focusing on notes of freedom and American conservative ideals, Mr. Cruz refused to specifically call for Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's \uc2 election\uc2 , despite repeated shouts from the crowd to endorse him, including ''We want \uc2 Trump\uc2 !'' He chided the crowd and said, ''Don't stay home in November,'' but he also told them to ''vote their conscience.''\par \par \uc2 As Mr. Cruz wrapped up his extended remarks, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  emerged from a side entrance, waving to the crowd. He joined his family in the V.I.P. box, as both the crowd and every television camera cut from Mr. Cruz just as he was delivering the crescendo to his remarks. He closed saying, ''God bless America'' on a split screen, as the cameras had shifted to Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , who in a rare spontaneous moment at the often orchestrated conventions, stole the show from Mr. Cruz once more.\par \par \uc2 _____\par \par \uc2 Mr. Gingrich took the stage after a brief introduction by his wife, Callista, and attempted to clean up the non-endorsement by Mr. Cruz that sent the night into momentary chaos. Citing Mr. Cruz's line that ''you can vote your conscience,'' Mr. Gingrich offered ''to paraphrase Ted Cruz: if you want to protect the Constitution of the United States, the only possible choice is the \uc2 Trump\uc2 -Pence Republican ticket.''\par \par \uc2 He then transitioned to a long list of national security failures, portraying Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  as the only candidate who can handle the foreign policy threats facing the country, before returning to a closing call for unity.\par \par \uc2 _____\par \par \uc2 Gov. Scott Walker of Wisconsin, a one-time \uc2 Trump\uc2  rival, declared that Americans should choose Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  over Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , repeating that ''America deserves better!'' Mr. Walker said he had always been clear that he would support any Republican against Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  in the general \uc2 election\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Fact Check: He was never an enthusiastic \uc2 Trump\uc2  fan. Mr. Walker endorsed Mr. Cruz ahead of the Wisconsin primary, and later expressed disappointment that Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  would be the party's standard-bearer. ''It's just sad in America that we have such poor choices right now,'' Mr. Walker said then.\par \par \uc2 _____\par \par \uc2 Senator \uc2 Marco Rubio\uc2  of Florida, another former \uc2 Trump\uc2  rival, once called Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  a ''con man,'' and worse, as he fought a bitter campaign. But on Wednesday, Mr. Rubio appeared in a brief video to concede that ''the time for fighting each other is over.'' The video was hardly full of enthusiasm, but he did urge voters to choose Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  over Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 _____\par \par \uc2 Eric \uc2 Trump\uc2 , one of Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's sons, offered a passionate, energetic speech on behalf of his father, describing him as the candidate who is running to make the lives of ordinary Americans better. The elder \uc2 Trump\uc2  sat in the audience for his son's remarks, clapping occasionally but appearing to express displeasure as the large screen behind \uc2 Eric \uc2 Trump\uc2  appeared to malfunction.\par \par \uc2 Eric \uc2 Trump\uc2  said his father ran for president because he could ''no longer bear witness'' to America's decline. He urged people to vote for his father, a man who ''can't be bought, sold, purchased, bribed, coerced or intimidated.''\par \par \uc2 _____\par \par \uc2 Laura Ingraham, the conservative radio talk-show host, energized the crowd with verbal attacks on two targets: Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  and the media. Ms. Ingraham called her the ''woman who helped orchestrate America's decline,'' and she drew chants of ''Lock her up!'' when she said that ''many in public office don't enforce or respect the rule of law -- isn't that right, Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 ?'' She called the media her ''friends,'' but she accused journalists of not reporting on ''the phonies, the frauds and the corruption that has gone unexposed and uncovered for too long.''\par \par \uc2 _____\par \par \uc2 Pam Bondi, the attorney general of Florida, emphasized ''laws'' in her remarks, using that theme to call attention to the fatal shooting of three police officers in Baton Rouge, La., on Sunday. She drove home her riff by saying, ''now more than ever, laws that back our law enforcement. They have our backs, and \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  will have your backs.''\par \par \uc2 _____\par \par \uc2 Eileen Collins\uc2 , the first woman to lead a space shuttle mission, may be the only speaker at the convention to appear onstage without once mentioning the Republican Party, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , Mr. Obama or any other politicians. Instead, on the 47th anniversary of Neil Armstrong's walk on the moon, Ms. Collins offered a gauzy appeal for America to be a ''nation of explorers.'' One thing she never said: Support Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  for president.\par \par \uc2 _____\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  is extremely unpopular with the Hispanic population, as numerous polls have shown, but he is not without support in the community. Ralph Alvarado, a state senator from Kentucky, took the stage to proclaim, in English and in Spanish, why Hispanics should back Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  against Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 ''Hispanics believe what Republicans believe,'' he declared, listing off ''religious liberty,'' support of the Second Amendment and free speech as key examples. In Spanish, he addressed his ''hermanos Hispanos,'' or Hispanic brothers, saying that their families had fled countries that were plagued by corruption, and urging them to not let that corruption plague the United States.\par \par \uc2 Find out what you need to know about the 2016 presidential race today, and get politics news updates via \uc2 Facebook\uc2 , \uc2 Twitter\uc2  and the First Draft newsletter.\par \par \uc2 Document NYTF000020160721ec7l0005x\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 Politics; SECT\par \b \uc2 Bill \uc2 Clinton\uc2  Said to Back Virginia's Tim Kaine for Vice President\b0\par\par\uc2 By AMY CHOZICK and JONATHAN MARTIN \par \uc2 673 \uc2 words\par \uc2 21 July 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 The New York Times on the Web\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 As \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  prepares to make her choice for a vice-presidential candidate, \uc2 Bill \uc2 Clinton\uc2  has privately expressed his support for Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia, according to three Democrats briefed on the conversations with the former president this week.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  believes that Mr. Kaine, 58, a former governor and member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, has the domestic and national security r\u233\'00\'E9sum\u233\'00\'E9 that both appeals to voters and makes him prepared for the presidency.\par \par \uc2 In an interview with Charlie Rose of \uc2 PBS\uc2  on Monday, Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  said she was ''afflicted with the responsibility gene'' and would value experience and preparedness over any other calculations in choosing a No. 2.\par \par \uc2 In recent days, Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  narrowed down her pick, and she is likely to appear with her running mate Saturday at a rally in Florida, though she could announce her choice in advance of the campaign event in a text to supporters.\par \par \uc2 Tom Vilsack, the agriculture secretary; Thomas E. Perez, the secretary of labor; and James G. Stravidis, a retired four-star Navy admiral, remain contenders.\par \par \uc2 On Wednesday, Robby Mook, Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's campaign manager, invited Senator Elizabeth Warren's aides to the campaign's Brooklyn headquarters to discuss how the Massachusetts senator can be helpful in the coming months. That was interpreted by some people with knowledge of the process as a sign that Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  has settled on a choice.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Vilsack is currently scheduled to appear with Senator Claire McCaskill of Missouri in her home state on Thursday and Friday, though he could still cancel.\par \par \uc2 People close to Mr. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , who could discuss private conversations only without attribution, said that the former president had left the decision entirely to his wife and that he also has close relationships with Mr. Vilsack and Mr. Perez.\par \par \uc2 A spokesman for the \uc2 Clinton\uc2  campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\par \par \uc2 Democrats in contact with Mr. Kaine and his associates say their tone has shifted in recent days. After weeks of playing down their prospects of joining the Democratic ticket, the senator and his loyalists are becoming far more circumspect.\par \par \uc2 In 2008, \uc2 Barack Obama\uc2  considered picking Mr. Kaine as his running mate before selecting Senator \uc2 Joseph R. Biden Jr\uc2 ., and on Wednesday the White House signaled that Mr. Obama would support Mr. Kaine on the ticket.\par \par \uc2 Virginia is a swing state that has been gravitating toward the Democrats in recent elections. In 2008, Mr. Obama defeated \uc2 John McCain\uc2  in Virginia by more than six percentage points, marking the first time since Lyndon B. Johnson's victory in 1964 that the state had voted for a Democratic presidential nominee.\par \par \uc2 An NBC News-Wall Street Journal poll from July 15 showed Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  beating Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  for the state's 13 electoral votes by nine percentage points.\par \par \uc2 Advocates for Mr. Kaine are guardedly optimistic about his prospects, although Mr. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  has expressed some hesitation about the Virginia senator because of the risk of losing Mr. Kaine's Senate seat to a Republican, according to two Democrats briefed on the deliberations.\par \par \uc2 Choosing Mr. Kaine could alter the balance of power in Congress should Democrats retake the Senate this year but gain a one-seat majority. While \uc2 Gov. Terry McAuliffe\uc2  of Virginia could appoint a Democrat to succeed Mr. Kaine next year, the seat would be up for grabs in a special \uc2 election\uc2  that would coincide with the state's governor contest in November 2017.\par \par \uc2 With Republicans typically faring better in such ''off-off year'' elections, when turnout dips, Democrats could lose what was Mr. Kaine's Senate seat just a year after Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  is sworn in, a political risk both the Clintons have been acutely aware of as they weighed the pros and cons of vice-presidential candidates.\par \par \uc2 Find out what you need to know about the 2016 presidential race today, and get politics news updates via \uc2 Facebook\uc2 , \uc2 Twitter\uc2  and the First Draft newsletter.\par \par \uc2 Document NYTF000020160721ec7l0005i\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 National Desk; SECTA\par \b \uc2 Republican Hopefuls Quietly Filling Wings, Their Eyes Set on 2020\b0\par\par\uc2 By JENNIFER STEINHAUER and JONATHAN MARTIN \par \uc2 1,396 \uc2 words\par \uc2 21 July 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 15\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 CLEVELAND -- Speaking to Iowa Republicans here on Monday, Gov. Scott Walker of Wisconsin repeatedly reminded them of his childhood in the state that kicks off the presidential nominating process. Before the same crowd on Tuesday, Senator Tom Cotton of Arkansas had his own boast. ''I'm the only politician here this week that married a girl born in Iowa,'' said Mr. Cotton, admitting it was a ''pander.''\par \par \uc2 Bruised by their indecorous primary, which left some of the party's brightest stars reduced to wounded pets on the side of the road and pessimistic about taking over the White House in November, many Republicans are quietly turning their focus to 2020.\par \par \uc2 Jockeying for future presidential campaigns is a feature of every party convention, and the Republican meeting in Cleveland this week is no exception. But the subtle wooing and chit collecting have taken on a new air of urgency this year, with many party leaders openly skeptical about whether \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2  can defeat \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's ascendance has shown that Republican voters craved alternatives to conventional candidates from governor's mansions and Congress.\par \par \uc2 But that is not stopping a conventional array of aspirants from lining up once again. The roster of potential 2020 candidates includes several of this year's primary losers, including Senators Ted Cruz of Texas and \uc2 Marco Rubio\uc2  of Florida, Gov. John Kasich of Ohio and Mr. Walker, as well as younger hopefuls like Mr. Cotton.\par \par \uc2 They calculate that the experiment with Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , if he loses, will trigger buyer's remorse within the party. The next nominee will be well positioned, they estimate, because the electorate will be ready for change after three consecutive Democratic terms in the White House.\par \par \uc2 ''If you thought this year was an attractive race on our side, imagine 2020,'' said Phil Cox, a former executive director at the \uc2 Republican Governors Association\uc2 . ''You'll have 30 people running.''\par \par \uc2 Mr. Cotton and Mr. Walker are visiting the delegations from all three of the traditional early nominating states -- Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina -- and Mr. Kasich is rekindling ties with the New Hampshire delegates. Each of the prospects has also been racing through Cleveland's heavily secured streets to court major donors like Las Vegas casino magnate \uc2 Sheldon Adelson\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 For now, much of the positioning is going on relatively quietly. Yet potential candidates are already making moves to help pave their paths. Most obvious is Mr. Cruz, who has landed a prime speaking spot at the convention despite several nasty scrapes this year with Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Mr. Cruz has created two nonprofits to serve his political ambitions and maintain his donor database. He has also installed a veteran political operative who worked on his campaign as his new chief of staff, a move the senator's associates said was done to make the office less a miniature think tank and more a presidential incubator.\par \par \uc2 And his political allies, including Senator Mike Lee of Utah, staged an insurrection on the convention floor on Monday as part of a failed attempt to change party rules that would have been more advantageous for Mr. Cruz's future political ambitions (one of the changes: mandating that only registered Republicans can participate in presidential caucuses and primaries).\par \par \uc2 Mr. Cruz has been aggressively pushing legislation that would help his political agenda, including a recent bill that would place mandatory minimum sentences on illegal immigrants who return to the country.\par \par \uc2 ''My focus now is fighting for the very same conservative principles in the \uc2 United States Senate\uc2  that were at the heart of our presidential campaign,'' Mr. Cruz said.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Cotton, 39, is also trying to seduce early-state Republicans while playing nice with his colleagues.\par \par \uc2 He was the keynote speaker in March at the Silver Elephant Dinner for rising stars among South Carolina Republicans, and he won a speaking role at the Iowa Economic Forum lunch with convention delegates here.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Cotton was one of five freshman senators who traveled to Arizona in support of Senator \uc2 John McCain\uc2 , who is facing a tough re-\uc2 election\uc2  fight there. He attended a Republican dinner in Missouri for Senator Roy Blunt, who is also in a tough race.\par \par \uc2 In August, Mr. Cotton will travel the country, including a stop in Nevada to campaign for Representative Joe Heck, a Republican, who is running for the seat being vacated by Senator Harry Reid, the minority leader.\par \par \uc2 Like Mr. Cruz, Mr. Cotton is attempting to establish himself on the right flank of the potential primary field over one of the most galvanizing issues among conservative activists. ''I think the fact of the matter is that right now, we have too much immigration,'' Mr. Cotton said.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Rubio decided to run for his Senate seat in Florida after repeatedly denying that he would. But his colleagues have noted that he has become far more engaged in Senate business over the past few months than over the past two years, taking the lead on fighting for funding for combating the Zika virus, for example.\par \par \uc2 For his part, Mr. Kasich is making the most of his home-state convention, though he is not scheduled to speak. With the governor under attack by Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's campaign for not endorsing the party's standard-bearer, allies of Mr. Kasich struck back aggressively in a way that could well position him for the future with the many \uc2 Trump\uc2  skeptics in the party's ranks.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Kasich has been ubiquitous this week. He addressed the N.A.A.C.P. in Cincinnati and appeared at fund-raising events in Cleveland for the committees dedicated to electing Republican governors, House members and senators. He will also appear at a foreign policy seminar and a Hispanic Chamber of Commerce event.\par \par \uc2 Bridging the gap between the hard-right wing of the party and the pragmatists is the House speaker and convention chairman, Paul D. Ryan, whom many Republicans tried to lure into challenging Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  at the convention.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Ryan has threaded the needle by supporting Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  while also openly disagreeing with him on some issues. But he will soon be pressed about whether he intends to make a career of the speakership or position himself for a presidential bid if Democrats take the White House and Senate.\par \par \uc2 As the speaker, he has a natural friend-making apparatus in his fund-raising operations. Since he became the speaker, his political organization has raised nearly $38 million, with more than $25 million used to help re-elect House Republicans. His campaign committee, Ryan for Congress, has $9.75 million in cash on hand, the most for any member of the House.\par \par \uc2 This month, he will have an opportunity to swell those coffers and make new friends for a future presidential run when he appears at the Koch organization's summer gathering at the Broadmoor resort in Colorado.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Ryan left little doubt about how he wanted to rebrand the party should Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  lose.\par \par \uc2 ''The Republican Party is a ship floating on populism right now,'' Mr. Ryan said. He criticized those who ''profit off anger, outrage and dark emotions for short-term goals.''\par \par \uc2 Gaming out policy implications, let alone promising candidates, can be folly in volatile political times. After all, few in the party at the last convention could have ever imagined Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  emerging as their nominee in 2016. And should he fall short in November, his example may only inspire a cast of imitators four years from now.\par \par \uc2 ''Are there more Mark Cubans out there who say, 'Well, this is easy, and I'm not a nut, so I may even be successful'?'' said Dave Carney, a longtime Republican strategist, referring to the wealthy \uc2 Dallas Mavericks\uc2  owner and ubiquitous media presence. ''\uc2 Trump\uc2  has given them a road map.''\par \par \uc2 Find out what you need to know about the 2016 presidential race today, and get politics news updates via \uc2 Facebook\uc2 , \uc2 Twitter\uc2  and the First Draft newsletter.\par \par \uc2 Clockwise from top, Senator Ted Cruz, speaking Wednesday night; Senator Tom Cotton of Arkansas; and the House speaker, Paul D. Ryan. The three men are among the potential future candidates at the Republican convention in Cleveland this week.

\par\par \uc2 EDITORIAL\par \uc2 Editorial Desk; SECTA\par \b \uc2 The G.O.P.'s Surreal Diversity Show\b0\par\par\uc2 By THE EDITORIAL BOARD \par \uc2 697 \uc2 words\par \uc2 21 July 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 22\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 The unrelenting whiteness of the Republican National Convention -- perhaps the whitest in 100 years -- is stunning in itself. \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  has tried to mask its segregationist flavor by strategically featuring African-American speakers to colorize the hall and validate the pronouncements of white speakers like \uc2 Rudolph Giuliani\uc2 , the former New York mayor, who have ceaselessly lectured black people on criminality. Among these was David Clarke Jr., the Milwaukee County sheriff, who denounced the Black Lives Matter campaign and applauded the acquittal of a Baltimore police officer charged in the death of Freddie Gray.\par \par \uc2 But after the lights go down in Cleveland, when the yelling subsides, the balloons go limp and the delegates go home, the party will be alone with its message and its nominee.\par \par \uc2 What next? Why, minority outreach, of course. ''\uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2 's going to be doing a Hispanic engagement tour coming up soon,'' said the party chairman, Reince Priebus.\par \par \uc2 ''Engagement'' doesn't seem likely, given public reactions to the \uc2 Trump\uc2  campaign's message of suspicion and disgust. In some states, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  is polling at zero among black voters. A new Latino Decisions survey has 83 percent of Latino voters saying Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  is a racist, and 71 percent saying he has made the Republican Party more hostile to Latinos. Those results track closely with other polls this month, one conducted by The Wall Street Journal and NBC News and one by \uc2 Univision\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Still, Mr. Priebus insisted on Sunday that Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  ''understands we need to grow the party, party of the open door, tone, rhetoric, spirit -- all those things matter when communicating to the American people.''\par \par \uc2 His loose syntax suggested he was just tossing words out, knowing they were meaningless. What else could they be, given the wretched rhetoric of the convention? All week, speaker after speaker has painted a vision of a country imperiled by black anarchists, cop killers, immigrant murderers, Muslim terrorists and criminal Democrats.\par \par \uc2 But let's take Mr. Priebus at his word, and accept that he and other party operatives -- despite their support for Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  -- recognize the limits of a presidential campaign based on chauvinism and fear. What might it take between now and November to win over nonwhite voters, especially Latinos?\par \par \uc2 For Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , who began his campaign by dehumanizing Mexicans as a nation of criminals and went downhill from there, there is nothing to be done. To reverse the damage, he would have to renounce everything he has said about rapists, murderers, mass deportations and walls, and disown the nature of his entire campaign. That's not going to happen.\par \par \uc2 If the Republican Party wants to escape the \uc2 Trump\uc2  undertow, it will be up to others to repair the distrust and anger. So far they have been profiles in cowardice. The House speaker, \uc2 Paul Ryan\uc2 , plus Republican senators and Senate candidates -- \uc2 John McCain\uc2  in Arizona, Joe Heck in Nevada, Pat Toomey in Pennsylvania, Rob Portman in Ohio -- are all supporting Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  while strenuously trying to change the subject. \uc2 Marco Rubio\uc2 , in Florida, is running for re-\uc2 election\uc2  talking about algae blooms.\par \par \uc2 The Latino electorate, meanwhile, isn't going away or shrinking. Neither is the challenge of confronting immigration. Instead of a ''Hispanic engagement tour,'' which is almost sure to be a farcical gesture, Republicans could stop demonizing immigrants and start thinking about actually fixing the immigration system.\par \par \uc2 This means getting back to where they were only three years ago, when an ambitious bipartisan plan handily passed the Senate. That bill was blocked by hard-core House Republicans fanning the same border hysteria and cultural anxieties that Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  exploits today. Republicans will eventually understand -- even if their nominee does not -- that there is no future in being the party of white grievance and racial exclusion. Not in these diverse United States. Whether that insight is reached through reflection and self-correction, or an autopsy of yet another failed presidential campaign, remains to be seen.\par \par \uc2 Follow The \uc2 New York Times\uc2  Opinion section on \uc2 Facebook\uc2  and \uc2 Twitter\uc2  (@NYTOpinion), and sign up for the Opinion Today newsletter.\par \par \uc2 DRAWING (DRAWING BY JOAN WONG) \par \par \uc2 Document NYTF000020160721ec7l0007o\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

GRYNBAUM; Brooks Barnes contributed reporting. \par \uc2 1,315 \uc2 words\par \uc2 21 July 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 1\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Will Fox News's prime-time lineup remain intact? Will the network's ratings fall back to earth after this wild presidential \uc2 election\uc2 ? Who could possibly replace Roger Ailes?\par \par \uc2 Breathless, yes, but Fox News's seemingly unassailable position as the most powerful cable news channel was rocked this week by the news that Mr. Ailes, the only leader the network has ever known, was negotiating his exit as chairman after accusations of sexual harassment.\par \par \uc2 No matter how unseemly his departure, Mr. Ailes will leave Fox News in strong shape. Thanks to an \uc2 election\uc2  year that has been a boon for all cable news channels, the network has never had higher ratings. And on Wednesday, as confusion swirled about the leadership of the network, many financial analysts told investors that the huge profits it delivers for \uc2 21st Century Fox\uc2  were in no danger of suddenly disappearing.\par \par \uc2 ''There's a very loyal Fox audience,'' said \uc2 Andrew Heyward\uc2 , a former president of CBS News. ''That was part of Roger's brilliance: to identify a very large group that got badly underserved by mainstream TV news. Those people are not going anywhere.''\par \par \uc2 But in the television industry -- particularly in Cleveland, where many senior executives are attending the Republican National Convention -- speculation about the network's future flowed freely at cocktail parties and political breakfasts.\par \par \uc2 The most pressing topic was who could replace the 76-year-old Mr. Ailes.\par \par \uc2 Among the initial candidates being discussed in the executive offices of \uc2 21st Century Fox\uc2 , according to a person briefed on the discussions who spoke on the condition of anonymity, are familiar names like Bill Shine, Fox News's senior executive vice president for programming; \uc2 David Rhodes\uc2 , the president of CBS News and a former Fox executive; and \uc2 Jesse Angelo\uc2 , chief executive of The New York Post.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Shine has the advantage of already being at Fox News. His appointment could calm the nerves of Fox employees, many of whom have privately complained this week about being left in the dark about what is going on at the network.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Rhodes worked at Fox News for several years and has an understanding of the idiosyncrasies of the network. \uc2 CBS\uc2  remains in third place in both the evening news slot and in the lucrative morning hours but it has seen ratings improvements, particularly for ''\uc2 CBS\uc2  This Morning.'' Mr. Rhodes is also friendly with \uc2 James Murdoch\uc2 , one of the three top executives at \uc2 21st Century Fox\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Mr. Angelo, who was the best man at \uc2 James Murdoch\uc2 's wedding and remains a close friend, has spent his entire career working for the Murdoch empire. When \uc2 Rupert Murdoch\uc2  debuted a pet project of his, the short-lived iPad news project The Daily, he chose Mr. Angelo to run it. He has been the publisher of The Post for three and a half years.\par \par \uc2 It is also possible that the Murdochs could choose another senior Fox News executive (\uc2 Jay Wallace\uc2  and \uc2 Michael Clemente\uc2  both run divisions) or someone from Sky News, their European flagship, which James has been closely involved in. Such a pick would offer corporate continuity and signal that the Murdochs are serious about refreshing the culture of Fox News post-Ailes.\par \par \uc2 But Sky News is a far more sober outlet than its scrappier American cousin. Its anchors are restrained from offering boisterous opinions by strict European broadcasting rules. That could make for a rocky transition to the American cable news landscape, where editorializing is the norm.\par \par \uc2 Whoever comes in will have to take care of a potentially restless prime-time lineup. Several of the network's stars, including Bill O'Reilly and Sean Hannity, have clauses in their contracts that will allow them to leave if Mr. Ailes is no longer in a position of power, according to a person with knowledge of their deals who discussed a personnel issue on the condition of anonymity. Mr. O'Reilly suggested in a recent interview that he was contemplating retirement. Megyn Kelly's contract expires in a year and she has been open about the possibility of leaving.\par \par \uc2 Ms. Kelly participated in an internal investigation into Mr. Ailes, prompted by a sexual harassment lawsuit filed by the former anchor Gretchen Carlson on July 6. Ms. Kelly told investigators that Mr. Ailes made a number of advances toward her in the past, according to two people briefed on the matter.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Ailes has denied the accusations by Ms. Carlson and Ms. Kelly.\par \par \uc2 Whether Ms. Kelly's participation will alienate her from Fox News colleagues who are loyal to Mr. Ailes is an open question.\par \par \uc2 While there is no direct parallel to Mr. Ailes in the history of television news, either in personality or current circumstances, there are examples of similar operations losing their rudders -- the retirement of Roone Arledge from ABC News in 1998 or the ouster of \uc2 Ted Turner\uc2  from \uc2 CNN\uc2  in 2001. Each departure coincided with a period of difficulty for their former divisions.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Turner's exit from \uc2 CNN\uc2  -- a network he created -- roughly aligned with the rise of Fox News as the top-rated cable news channel.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Arledge was a beloved figure who oversaw the creation of shows like ''20/20'' and ''Monday Night Football'' and drove the ABC News evening flagship, ''World News Tonight,'' to longtime ratings dominance. By the time Mr. Arledge left, ABC News was beginning to show signs of wear and tear. In the years that followed, as ABC News worked to regain its footing, NBC News used the opening to pull far out in front in ratings.\par \par \uc2 Fox News remains by far the highest-rated cable news network, and by a wide margin. Even so, \uc2 CNN\uc2  has made up some ground this year, narrowing Fox News's lead in the 25- to 54-year-old demographic that is important to advertisers to its slimmest margin since the 2008 \uc2 election\uc2  year. (Ratings tend to go up during \uc2 election\uc2  cycles.)\par \par \uc2 But even if \uc2 CNN\uc2  is having a strong year, a Fox News without Mr. Ailes is still formidable.\par \par \uc2 Financial analysts were skeptical that any change would affect Fox News's bottom line, especially because the lucrative affiliate fees that Fox News earns are locked in for years.\par \par \uc2 If there is one area of concern, it is the network's aging audience. According to Nielsen, the median age of a Fox News viewer is 67, the oldest of the cable news channels. (MSNBC's is 63, and \uc2 CNN\uc2 's is 61.)\par \par \uc2 And with the rise of \uc2 Facebook\uc2  Live and other live-streaming services, there is a legitimate question about whether cable news channels face long-term growth problems. Until this \uc2 election\uc2 , and \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's involvement in it, cable news channels were showing gradually declining ratings.\par \par \uc2 ''Sustaining this level of intensity after November is going to be a challenge,'' Mr. Heyward, the former CBS president, said. ''The biggest challenge is one that Roger himself hadn't really confronted: the transition to digital platforms.''\par \par \uc2 And whoever succeeds Mr. Ailes will have two missions: bringing a restless staff back together and figuring out a future for the network.\par \par \uc2 As Charles L. Ponce de Leon, the author of the 2015 book ''That's the Way It Is: A History of Television News in America,'' put it: ''A broader course correction is necessary at Fox News -- they must attract younger viewers -- and that kind of effort will be extremely difficult because its loyal viewers have such rigid expectations.''\par \par \uc2 Roger Ailes and his wife, Elizabeth Tilson. Mr. Ailes is negotiating his exit from Fox News.

\par\par \b \uc2 The Republican Convention: \uc2 Ivanka \uc2 Trump\uc2  Set for Tough Role --- Nominee's daughter is expected to use convention speech to help win over women\b0\par\par\uc2 By Monica Langley   \par \uc2 562 \uc2 words\par \uc2 21 July 2016\par \uc2 The Wall Street Journal\par \uc2 J\par A4\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 Presidential nominee \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  handed his daughter Ivanka one of the most visible -- and toughest -- jobs at this week's Republican National Convention.\par \par \uc2 When Ms. \uc2 Trump\uc2  introduces her father before his prime-time speechon Thursday, her goal isn't only to show he is a warm family man but also to assert that he is a friend of women.\par \par \uc2 Trump\uc2  campaign advisers expect the 34-year-old Ms. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , a senior executive in the \uc2 Trump\uc2  real-estate empire and founder of her own fashion line, to provide the American public "living proof" her father believes women can and should do everything men do.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  needs his daughter's help to make headway with women -- the largest voter bloc and one with which he has dismal ratings -- as he begins a general \uc2 election\uc2  campaign against the first female presidential nominee for either national party.\par \par \uc2 Democratic presidential presumptive nominee \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  leads Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  by 15 percentage points among women, a recent Street Journal/NBC News poll found. Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  had support from 52% of women in July, compared with 37% for Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 In the same Wall Street Journal/NBC poll, he trails Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  by 7 percentage points among women age 50 and older, but by a whopping 25 points among women 18-49 years old.\par \par \uc2 Ms. \uc2 Trump\uc2  is facing "a challenging task but also an opportunity," says Nick LaLota, a New York delegate from Suffolk County. One potential problem: Ms. \uc2 Trump\uc2  avoids touching political issues that Republicans crave. Unlike her brothers Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  Jr. and \uc2 Eric \uc2 Trump\uc2 , who comfortably take on issues like gun rights and immigration, Ms. \uc2 Trump\uc2  never speaks as a political surrogate, only as a daughter and business colleague.\par \par \uc2 Ms. \uc2 Trump\uc2  won't persuade those GOP women that will vote mainly on issues, one Republican strategist said. Still, she will be able to show how she thrived in the tough real-estate business her father created, said David DiPietro, New York assemblyman and convention delegate.\par \par \uc2 Ms. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , considered the "first among equals" of Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's five children, is often put in the spotlight. At rallies where her father can be brash and confrontational, she softens his edges with her poise and stories of his encouragement as a father and mentor.\par \par \uc2 At the same time, Ms. \uc2 Trump\uc2  is very keen at reading him. For example, after Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's devastating Ohio primary loss, she wanted to give him a boost by introducing him at his next rally in New York, even though it meant appearing just six days after giving birth to her third child.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  values his daughter's opinions, even though she is a political novice with many liberal friends and fashion colleagues. She couldn't vote for her father in the closed New York Republican primary, because she is registered as an independent.\par \par \uc2 An early suggestion by Ms. \uc2 Trump\uc2  to her father that he offer some support for \uc2 Planned Parenthood\uc2  -- with the exception of its abortion services -- reflected Democratic leanings and caused flak in the Republican primaries. However, that position could be useful going into the general \uc2 election\uc2  now that Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  needs to attract Democratic and independent voters.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=wjco20160721000128"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document J000000020160721ec7l000bq\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw272\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4080\pichgoal600

Mike Pence accepted the Republican vice presidential nomination Wednesday night in a prime-time address that was overshadowed by lingering fissures inside the party.\par \par \uc2 On a night overtaken by the refusal of Texas Sen. Ted Cruz to endorse \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2 , the task fell to Mr. Pence to deliver a forceful argument on behalf of the Republican nominee, urging GOP voters to support a candidate whose style and politics are night and day from his own.\par \par \uc2 "While \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  was taking my measure as a possible running mate, I did some observing myself," Mr. Pence said. "He can be a little rough with politicians on the stage and I bet we see that again. But I've seen this good man up close, his utter lack of pretense, his respect for the people who work for him and his devotion to his family."\par \par \uc2 The Indiana governor headlined a night that also showcased three of Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's primary rivals -- Mr. Cruz, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio and Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker -- in an effort to rally the still-fractured party behind Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Mr. Pence took his first major step into the national spotlight Wednesday night in a measured, upbeat tone, describing his own introduction to Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  as he vaulted into the 2016 campaign earlier this month. He worked to sharpen the contrast between Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  and his rival, Democratic presumptive presidential nominee \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , whom he called the "secretary of status quo."\par \par \uc2 "At the very moment when America is crying out for something new and different, the other party has answered with a stale agenda and the most predictable of names," Mr. Pence said.\par \par \uc2 The Republican nominee picked Mr. Pence over New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and former House Speaker \uc2 Newt Gingrich\uc2 , who are both closer to Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  and share his more flamboyant style, because he presents an understated contrast to the nominee who can appeal to the conservative voters who have still not warmed to the New York businessman.\par \par \uc2 "We don't need two Donald Trumps out there," Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  Jr. said Wednesday at a breakfast sponsored by the Wall Street Journal.\par \par \uc2 In his acceptance speech, Mr. Pence joked, "He's a man known for a large personality, a colorful style and lots of charisma, so I guess he was just looking for some balance on the ticket."\par \par \uc2 Mr. Pence must prove his utility to the ticket by closing the sale with fence-sitting conservatives who still harbor doubts about the Republican nominee's convictions, rhetoric or vision for the country. He's also expected to take on the traditional running-mate role of going after the Democratic opposition.\par \par \uc2 "In the end this \uc2 election\uc2  just comes down to just two names on the ballot, so let's resolve right now that \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  will never become president of the United States of America," Mr. Pence said\par \par \uc2 The Indiana governor drew favorable reviews from delegates in the Quicken Loans Arena. Steve Toth, a Texas delegate, said Mr Pence "Hit it out of the park. He set himself up as a real leader of the party. He drew a stark contrast between where we have been and where we are going."\par \par \uc2 Donna Lowe, a California delegate said Mr. Pence's performance was just the thing she needed in her quest to get all her friends to vote GOP this year. "I love Pence, I feel like I'm watching a strong dad," said the 41-year-old sales manager. "Voters who still aren't sure about \uc2 Trump\uc2  might change their minds."\par \par \uc2 Ying Ma, deputy director of a pro \uc2 Trump\uc2  super PAC said the governor "has a sense of humor. He's not flashy but he got the job done."\par \par \uc2 In addition to balancing the GOP ticket with a larger-than-life outsider and an earnest insider, Mr. Pence impressed the \uc2 Trump\uc2  campaign with his knowledge of Congress and willingness to buck the system when he was in the House.\par \par \uc2 Messrs. Ryan and Pence occasionally locked horns with GOP leaders over budget reforms and other spending concerns.\par \par \uc2 The former Indiana congressman was also among the most vocal opponents of abortion-rights, gay marriage and the use of embryonic stem cells for research.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Pence "helps bridge the different parts of the conservative movement," said Mr. Ryan, who has endorsed Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  but called him "not my kind of conservative" here in Cleveland.\par \par \uc2 Pennsylvania Sen. Pat Toomey, a Republican locked in a tight re-\uc2 election\uc2  fight, said he was "encouraged" by the selection. Mr. Toomey hasn't so far endorsed Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 "That's the single biggest decision he made in this campaign, and he made a very good one," Mr. Toomey said in an interview Wednesday, calling Mr. Pence a "very principled, thoughtful conservative."\par \par \uc2 Vice-presidential picks don't typically have a huge impact on the overall success of the ticket. That is particularly true this year when voters' have uniquely strong views about the presidential candidates, the two least-popular major-party nominees in recent history.\par \par \uc2 Some 74% of all registered voters said that Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's decision to pick Mr. Pence would have no bearing on which candidate they support in November, according to a national Gallup survey of 901 registered voters. That's right in line with the last two vice presidents -- \uc2 Joe Biden\uc2  in 2008 and Dick Cheney in 2000.\par \par \uc2 However, Mr. Pence is relatively unknown. Just 39% of voters know the Indiana governor well enough to form an opinion of him. Only former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin was less well-known when Arizona Sen. John McCain plucked her out of obscurity to become his running mate during the 2008 race. She quickly became a major flashpoint in the race.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  made a dramatic arrival in Cleveland on Wednesday afternoon, taking a short helicopter from a Cleveland lakefront airport to a nearby rally. He was greeted by Mr. Pence and his family and the Republican ticket made very brief remarks before mingling with the crowd. "What begins in Cleveland will end in the White House," Mr. Pence said.\par \par \uc2 ---\par \par \uc2 Reid J.

\par\par \b \uc2 The Republican Convention: \uc2 Trump\uc2 , Allies Step Up Fundraising Efforts\b0\par\par\uc2 By Rebecca Ballhaus   \par \uc2 300 \uc2 words\par \uc2 21 July 2016\par \uc2 The Wall Street Journal\par \uc2 J\par A6\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 Republican nominee \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  and his allies are using this week's convention to escalate their fundraising efforts, holding meetings with major donors and readying to deploy Indiana Gov. Mike Pence, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's newly announced running mate, to help bolster their coffers.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Pence this week has met with some top fundraisers for Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's joint fund with the \uc2 Republican National Committee\uc2 , as they begin scheduling events for the running mate to headline around the country.\par \par \uc2 Donors who had given at least $100,000 to the \uc2 RNC\uc2  or to its joint fund with Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  gathered at the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame on Wednesday evening, as they waited for Mr. Pence to address the convention. And Messrs. Pence and \uc2 Trump\uc2  are set to address hundreds of donors at a lunch Thursday.\par \par \uc2 Meanwhile, in a sign that billionaire \uc2 Sheldon Adelson\uc2  may be getting closer to opening his wallet for Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , the casino owner also met with Mr. Pence on Tuesday, according to a person familiar with the meeting. Mr. Adelson has said he might spend around $100 million on Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's behalf, but recent \uc2 Federal \uc2 Election\uc2  Commission\uc2  records show he hasn't yet donated to the joint \uc2 Trump\uc2 -RNC fund, called \uc2 Trump\uc2  Victory.\par \par \uc2 A spokesman for Mr. Adelson didn't return a request for comment on the meeting.\par \par \uc2 A pro-\uc2 Trump\uc2  super PAC called Rebuilding America Now is also planning to deploy Mr. Pence to raise money. About 30 donors attended a fundraiser for the group Wednesday, during which \uc2 Trump\uc2  campaign chairman \uc2 Paul Manafort\uc2  told attendees the campaign was "grateful" for the group's efforts, according to Alex Castellanos, an official at the super PAC.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=wjco20160721000117"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document J000000020160721ec7l000bf\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw272\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4080\pichgoal600

\par\par \b \uc2 The Republican Convetion: \uc2 Trump\uc2  Divides GOP in Key Ohio County\b0\par\par\uc2 By Dante Chinni and Bob Davis   \par \uc2 722 \uc2 words\par \uc2 21 July 2016\par \uc2 The Wall Street Journal\par \uc2 J\par A5\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 DELAWARE, OHIO -- The Republican Party headquarters in Ohio's Delaware County was missing some key signage in its window last week: anything showing support for \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 There were signs for Sen. Rob Portman of Ohio and for other local candidates, but nothing visible for Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , who officially became the Republican presidential nominee on Tuesday. The \uc2 Trump\uc2  signs were purposely in the back of the office, out of view, the staff said.\par \par \uc2 Sara Marie Brenner, Delaware County chairwoman for the \uc2 Trump\uc2  campaign, wasn't surprised.\par \par \uc2 "The only reason they have any signs at all is I dropped a few hundred off there," she said in a sarcastic tone.\par \par \uc2 The spat over political signs at the party headquarters signals the deeper divisions among the Republicans here who could determine the outcome of the Nov. 8 presidential \uc2 election\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 Republican National Committee\uc2  chose Cleveland in August 2014 to host its presidential nominating party to maximize the exposure of its then-unknown nominee to voters in Ohio. It was a choice driven by history as much as the future: No Republican has won the White House without winning Ohio.\par \par \uc2 The location of Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's official nomination is calling attention to the challenges he faces in November -- from overcoming OhioGov. John Kasich's opposition to his former GOP primary rival to winning a state where his key messages resonate in some areas and repel in others. Mr. Kasich won the state's GOP primary in March.\par \par \uc2 A bit of good news for the nominee is that he starts the general \uc2 election\uc2  against \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , the presumptive Democratic nominee, in a dead heat here. A Wall Street Journal/NBC News/Marist poll last week showed them tied with Ohio registered voters at 39%.\par \par \uc2 For Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  to prevail in Ohio this fall, he must win big in places like Delaware County, an affluent, growing Columbus suburb of 193,000, where Republicans outnumber Democrats more than 3 to 1. But Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's success is far from assured.\par \par \uc2 County Republicans, many of whom consider themselves moderates, gave Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  22% of their vote in the primary. Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's signature issues don't resonate in a place where immigrants are prized as nannies and construction workers, and where international trade plays almost no role in the county's economic success.\par \par \uc2 The New York businessman's troubles in Delaware County reflect a broader problem: His tough rhetoric on trade and his history of controversy over race and religion turn off many traditional Republicans.\par \par \uc2 Holly Quaine, president of the Delaware Area Chamber of Commerce, said she is wrestling with the choice and may decide not to pull the presidential lever at all.\par \par \uc2 "The inertia in Delaware County is to vote Republican," she said. "But with \uc2 Trump\uc2 , you have to stop and think. He's \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  -- Kardashians, reality TV."\par \par \uc2 Politically, the area's establishment leanings can be seen in its loyalty to Mr. Kasich, who represented Delaware County and other parts of metropolitan Columbus when he was in the House. Mr. Kasich won 64% of the county vote in the primary.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Kasich has criticized Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  for running a "divisive campaign" and creating what he called a "toxic atmosphere." The governor hasn't endorsed Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , and he doesn't have a speaking slot at the convention.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's message is primarily targeted at workers who have gotten a raw deal in the global economy, an appeal that has helped him make important inroads to working-class voters.\par \par \uc2 "Globalization has made the financial elite who donate to politicians very wealthy. But it has left millions of our workers with nothing but poverty and heartache," he said at a rally in late June.\par \par \uc2 But many Republican strongholds consist of the financial elite. The median household income in Delaware County, for instance, is $91,000, about $40,000 above the national average, and 51% of the 25-and-older population has at least a bachelor's degree, 20 points above the national average.\par \par \uc2 During the 2016 primary campaign, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  didn't do particularly well in urban centers that are prospering economically.\par \par \uc2 (See related article: "Candidate Faces Challenge Surpassing Romney" -- WSJ July 21, 2016)\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=wjco20160721000099"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document J000000020160721ec7l000ax\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw272\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4080\pichgoal600

\par\par \b \uc2 Republican Convention Diary 2016: Quaking in California\b0\par\par\uc2 By Allysia Finley   \par \uc2 505 \uc2 words\par \uc2 21 July 2016\par \uc2 The Wall Street Journal\par \uc2 J\par A13\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 One optic trick Republican party leaders in Cleveland are using to present a unified image for TV audiences is to put California's 172 delegates front-and-center on the convention floor for the four-day gathering.\par \par \uc2 California's delegation is usually banished to the back of the hall at GOP conventions because the state isn't competitive in presidential elections. But this year the delegates were all selected by the \uc2 Trump\uc2  campaign and pledged to vote for him on the first ballot. No threat of anyone making a scene in front of the cameras.\par \par \uc2 The delegation includes former Rep. Doug Ose, who played a lead role in quashing dissent against Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's nomination on the convention rules committee. Rep. Duncan Hunter, who in February was among the first members of Congress to endorse Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , has led the New York businessman's congressional outreach. While California's convention delegates may all be loyal to Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , many Republicans fear that the nominee could cause collateral damage to the state party and down-ballot candidates -- and that the damage could be irreversible.\par \par \uc2 Since 2012, GOP voter registration in California has dropped to 4.8 million (27% of the electorate) from 5.2 million (30%), while Democratic registration has increased by 600,000 to eight million voters (45%). This partisan shift has been occurring for the past two decades since Pete Wilson championed an initiative barring illegal immigrants from using public services. But the GOP's decline has accelerated over the past year as many moderate Republicans have defected and more Hispanics and young voters register as Democrats.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's candidacy also threatens to depress Republican turnout while driving more Democrats to the polls. Casualties could include three freshmen Republican state Assembly members who won \uc2 election\uc2  in 2014 by reaching out to minority groups. A liberal backlash could sweep out these Republicans, giving Democrats a supermajority in the state Assembly.\par \par \uc2 Assemblywoman Catharine Baker represents a suburban district east of San Francisco Bay, where Democrats enjoy a 10-point voter-registration advantage. Assemblywoman Young Kim's Orange County district is 40% Hispanic and has a four-point Democratic voter-registration advantage. A south Los Angeles district (Dems +9) currently represented by David Hadley is also nearly half Hispanic and Asian.\par \par \uc2 There is also a risk that Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  could increase the California GOP's attrition in the \uc2 U.S. House of Representatives\uc2 . Republicans hold just 14 of the state's 53 congressional seats, down from 21 two decades ago. Many of these GOP-held districts have become more Democratic; Steve Knight (Palmdale) and David Valadao (Central Valley) in particular are going to have a fight on their hands in the fall. Republican candidates in California face the challenge of courting party moderates and Hispanics while not alienating Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's ardent supporters. If those candidates had the front-row seats in Cleveland, they might be squirming.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=wjco20160721000038"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document J000000020160721ec7l0009f\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw272\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4080\pichgoal600

\par\par \b \uc2 Don't Waste Your Time, Donald\b0\par\par\uc2 By Karl Rove   \par \uc2 902 \uc2 words\par \uc2 21 July 2016\par \uc2 The Wall Street Journal\par \uc2 J\par A11\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 After \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  finishes his acceptance speech Thursday in Cleveland, he will have only 109 days to cobble together the 270 Electoral College votes necessary to win the White House. More than a dozen weeks is a lot of time in life, but not much in a presidential campaign. Since entering the race, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  has spent 401 days to get to this point: Four-fifths of his campaign is already over.\par \par \uc2 The most precious asset any presidential candidate has is time. Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's must be wisely invested in states that are on the bubble, especially ones he may be able to take from the Democratic column.\par \par \uc2 Start with the 102 electoral votes from 13 states that Republicans have won in all of the last six elections -- from Texas and South Carolina to Wyoming and Utah. Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  should not visit any of these states for the rest of the campaign, except to raise money, debate, or refuel his jet.\par \par \uc2 There are 104 electoral votes in 11 states that Republicans have won in some recent presidential contests, including \uc2 Mitt Romney\uc2 's run in 2012. If this \uc2 election\uc2  is close, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  will likely carry almost all of these. Democrats will try for Georgia and Arizona but won't win them unless November is a blowout for \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 . Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , however, must focus on defending North Carolina and its 15 electoral votes. The state is experiencing an influx of white, college-educated professionals, an element of the GOP coalition that is skeptical of Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 The next step toward 270 is Florida, which awards 29 electoral votes. President Obama's 0.9% margin of victory there in 2012 was his narrowest. If Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  wins Florida, along with the 18 states (and D.C.) with 242 electoral votes that Democrats have carried in all of the last six elections, she's president.\par \par \uc2 Taking Florida and holding the Romney states would put Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  at 235 electoral votes. Then he must win the 18 from Ohio. No Republican has ever become president without the Buckeye State, and this \uc2 election\uc2  will be no different. Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  is competitive there. The Real Clear Politics average of polls puts him only 1.8 percentage points behind Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 . After adding Ohio's electoral votes to his stash he would be at 253.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  believes that he can also carry Pennsylvania, which would put him over the top. Perhaps. The Keystone State hasn't gone Republican since 1988, but President George W. Bush came within 2.5% of winning there in 2004, and Mr. Romney was within 5.4%. If Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's appeal to blue-collar, white swing voters is real, he could paint Pennsylvania red. If so, he is likely to win the White House with 273 electoral votes.\par \par \uc2 To hit 270 without Pennsylvania, he must cobble together 17 electoral votes from somewhere else. One possibility is winning some of the traditional battlegrounds: New Hampshire (4 electoral votes), Iowa (6), Colorado (9), Nevada (6) and Virginia (13). The first two of those states are possible for Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 ; the rest have diverse populations that make them problematic for him.\par \par \uc2 Another strategy would be for Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  to flip the Democrats' strongholds in the industrial Midwest: Michigan (16 electoral votes), Minnesota (10), and Wisconsin (10). The first might be within reach (a \uc2 CBS\uc2  poll last week had Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  at 39% in Michigan to Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's 42%); the other two are less likely to yield Republican victories. Maine, which awards electoral votes by congressional district, might be an additional target. The rural 2nd District, stretching from New Hampshire to Canada, may offer Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  its one elector.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's best approach might be to focus on New Hampshire, Iowa and Michigan as backups for Pennsylvania. But even this strategy illustrates how narrow a path Republicans have to the White House if their support is soft among Hispanics.\par \par \uc2 With only a short time to campaign, it is critical for Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  to focus his travel on a few states. A presidential candidate's appearance dominates local news, as well as the informal conversations among voters critical to swinging states into his column. Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's rallies can also inspire people to register, attract volunteers, energize his organization and sometimes even dispirit the opposition.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  has said that he will "play heavy" in California; put Illinois in play; "focus on New York"; and "campaign there" in Oregon. The opposite is likely true: He can't win the White House if he campaigns in these states. Every moment spent barnstorming Chicago or Portland is one he can't spend in a state where he has a shot.\par \par \uc2 A campaign can always raise more money or develop a new message but it can never create more time. \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  must spend the precious days he has in places where his presence could matter. Then he must stick to a message that resonates with swing voters by showing how he will make their lives better. This will require discipline, a quality we will need to see in abundance from Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  in the weeks ahead.\par \par \uc2 ---\par \par \uc2 Mr. Rove helped organize the political-action committee American Crossroads and is the author of "The Triumph of William McKinley" (\uc2 Simon & Schuster\uc2 , 2015).\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=wjco20160721000033"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document J000000020160721ec7l0009a\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw272\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4080\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 Wonder Land\par \b \uc2 A Nation at Half-Mast\b0\par\par\uc2 By Daniel Henninger   \par \uc2 873 \uc2 words\par \uc2 21 July 2016\par \uc2 The Wall Street Journal\par \uc2 J\par A11\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 The Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll reports that 73% of the electorate believes the United States is on the wrong track, a level normally associated with national crises, such as the 2008 financial meltdown. Amid the GOP convention in Cleveland and with the Democratic mother ship landing next week in Philadelphia, one has to wonder: Are the campaigns of \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  and \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  also on the wrong track?\par \par \uc2 As recently as a week ago, the \uc2 election\uc2 's narrative was set: \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2 , an apolitical outsider, represented the mad-as-hell vote -- immigrants, trade, political correctness, whatever you've got.\par \par \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , possessed with a lifetime of political experience, would not only extend the Obama presidency but expand the federal government's hand of help to whatever problem you've got.\par \par \uc2 And for those done with the details, it's simple: NeverTrump versus Crooked Hillary.\par \par \uc2 Then, just days before the GOP convention, the world snapped.\par \par \uc2 On Tuesday, President \uc2 Obama\uc2  and former President George W. Bush spoke at the memorial service for the five cops gunned down in Dallas.\par \par \uc2 Some 48 hours later, an Islamist terrorist in Nice, France, drove a tractor trailer across and over men, women and children, slaughtering 84 of them.\par \par \uc2 On Friday evening, a military coup erupted in Turkey, a nation of 78 million, \uc2 NATO\uc2  ally and key state in the war on Middle Eastern terror.\par \par \uc2 Sunday morning, a lone gunman shot to death three cops in Baton Rouge, La. Just the week before, two black men had been killed in separate incidents with the police.\par \par \uc2 The compression of these nearly unimaginable events is knocking the 2016 \uc2 election\uc2  off the familiar narrative of economic anxiety, terrorism, the border and Washington dysfunction.\par \par \uc2 Driving past a suburban city hall in Cleveland last weekend, a relative of mine said, "It seems like the flags are always at half mast now. They go up and then they come back down." She's right. The U.S. has become a nation at half-mast.\par \par \uc2 What the week's events has pressed into people's minds is the feeling, correct or not, of the absence of answers or explanation. Voters are starting to feel trapped with no apparent exit.\par \par \uc2 That was the silent scream discovered on the \uc2 Facebook\uc2  page of murdered Baton Rouge police officer Montrell Jackson, a 32-year-old black man: "I swear to God I love this city but I wonder if this city loves me. In uniform I get nasty hateful looks and out of uniform some consider me a threat. I've experienced so much in my short life and these last three days have tested me to the core. These are trying times." Effectively speaking for the entire country, he wrote: "I'm tired physically and emotionally."\par \par \uc2 I'm not suggesting people are looking for some sort of can't-we-all-just-get-along moment from these two candidates or "toning down the rhetoric." The word that comes to mind is gravitas -- a candidate whose seriousness rises to the electorate's.\par \par \uc2 Up to now, the content of these two campaigns, and that includes the unconventional \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2 's, has been by the book: Divide the electorate with wedge issues -- immigration on the right, police abuse on the left -- and build from that base to victory.\par \par \uc2 At the GOP convention Monday night, Alabama's Sen. Jeff Sessions, a key \uc2 Trump\uc2  adviser, delivered a base speech bleeding with red meat on the immigrant threat.\par \par \uc2 The Democratic convention has scheduled speeches by seven Mothers of the Movement, mothers whose children were killed in confrontations with the police. This notwithstanding the fact that the legal system has cleared the accused officers in several cases. In an open letter to the police Tuesday, Mr. Obama said, "We have your backs." Too late. The politics of his party on the police has been set.\par \par \uc2 Inside both these issues one may find disagreements on substance, but let us be cynical: The politicians, pundits and activists have been scapegoating immigrants and cops to produce votes.\par \par \uc2 That strategy, kept aloft with populist demagoguery, always carried the risk that the reality might get worse than the rhetoric. Now, for the cops, it has.\par \par \uc2 Like Ted Cruz, originator of the anti-immigrant template, \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2 's strategy has been to divide the electorate, animate his side and win. It is, or was, a plausible political calculation. I wonder, though, as last week's numbing events settle into consciousness, whether enough voters in the decisive battleground states -- Florida, Ohio, Virginia, Wisconsin, Colorado, Pennsylvania, North Carolina and the rest -- will think the \uc2 Trump\uc2  strategy is still the basis for a presidency equal to the times.\par \par \uc2 It is impossible here not to note the obvious -- that most voters find \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's constant claims of presidential seriousness wholly implausible.\par \par \uc2 The acceptance speech \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  will deliver Thursday night is his chance to rise from the level shared now in the public mind by both him and Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 . To date, the electorate has heard payback, blame and promises. After the events of the past week, they'll be looking for something bigger than that.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=wjco20160721000030"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document J000000020160721ec7l00097\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw272\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4080\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 REVIEW & OUTLOOK (Editorial)\par \b \uc2 Indiana Growth Model\b0\par\par\uc2 729 \uc2 words\par \uc2 21 July 2016\par \uc2 The Wall Street Journal\par \uc2 J\par A12\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 President Obama visited Elkhart, Indiana, on June 1 to tout the state's economic recovery, taking credit for its success and claiming that it represents the 2016 \uc2 election\uc2 's basic policy choice. He's right, but the economic lessons speak better of GOP Governor and vice presidential nominee \uc2 Mike Pence\uc2  and his predecessor \uc2 Mitch Daniels\uc2  than they do Mr. Obama's policies.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Obama touted his auto bailout, which he said rescued the city's recreational vehicle industry that in 2009 was responsible in some way for about 70% of Elkhart's employment. The cyclical RV industry has recovered along with the economy, but then so has the rest of the state. The most interesting statistic is that only about 60% of Elkhart's jobs are still tied to RV sales as the economy has diversified.\par \par \uc2 All states have seen declines in the jobless rate, and Indiana's has fallen to 5% in May from 8.4% in 2013 when Mr. Pence became Governor. The Indiana difference is that the rate has fallen even as the labor force has increased by nearly 187,000. Many states have seen their jobless rates fall in part because so many people have left the labor force, driving down the national labor participation rate to lows not seen since the 1970s. The Illinois workforce has grown by only about 71,000 in the same period, though it is roughly twice as large. Indiana is adding jobs fast enough that people are rejoining the workforce.\par \par \uc2 The Indiana turnaround began under Mr. Daniels, who took office in 2004 after 16 years of Democratic governors. His command to state employees was "we are here to raise the disposable income of Hoosiers."\par \par \uc2 Mr. Daniels inherited a budget mess but eight years later Indiana was a rare state with a triple-A credit rating. He toyed briefly with raising the top personal income-tax rate, which we criticized at the time and was stopped by the legislature. He proceeded to cut the state corporate tax rate to 6.5% from 8.5%. He also took a big political risk by contracting with a private company to operate the Indiana toll road for $3.8 billion.\par \par \uc2 Indiana adopted right to work in 2012, allowing individuals to opt out of unions, a key signal for many CEOs about the business climate. He passed the most ambitious state-wide school voucher plan in the country, which appears to have contributed to better student performance. The state high school graduation rate has reached 88%, seventh best in the U.S. Mr. Daniels, who is now president of Purdue University, also reformed Medicaid and health care for state employees via health-savings accounts.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Pence has continued the progress, cutting taxes every year of his tenure even as the state has continued to pile up budget surpluses. He cut the individual tax rate to 3.3% in 2015 from 3.4% and it will fall to 3.23% in 2017, the lowest in the Midwest, according to the \uc2 Tax Foundation\uc2 . One reason the tax rate can stay so low and flat is because it applies to a relatively broad base of income with fewer loopholes than more steeply progressive tax codes.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Pence has also extended eligibility for the school choice program to siblings of voucher recipients, children living in failing public-school districts and those with special needs. As our Allysia Finley reported this week, since 2012 the number of recipients has increased 10-fold to 33,000 students, while state funding has swelled to $132 million from $15 million. Nearly 60% of students in the state now qualify for vouchers.\par \par \uc2 We could go on, especially regarding regulatory relief. But the broader lesson is that the Daniels-Pence agenda turned around a state that was struggling and has made it a fiscal and pro-growth model. The reforms focused on raising incomes by making the state more hospitable to capital investment and trying to improve the education and skills of all Hoosiers.\par \par \uc2 In choosing Mr. Pence as his running mate, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  made the smart decision to associate himself with that record. The Indiana policies and performance that Mr. Pence touted Wednesday night are ones the rest of the country could emulate -- starting with Washington, D.C.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=wjco20160721000025"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document J000000020160721ec7l00092\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved.  \par \par \uc2 MANILA -- The Supreme Court of the Philippines dismissed corruption charges on Tuesday against a former president, Gloria Macapagal Arroyo, and ordered her release from a Manila hospital where she has been detained since 2012. Her lawyer said she was likely to be freed on Wednesday.\par \par \uc2 The court, voting 11 to 4, ruled that there was insufficient evidence to bring a case against Mrs. Arroyo in connection with the misuse of 366 million pesos in lottery funds during her administration, worth about $8.8 million at the time of her arrest.\par \par \uc2 Lawyers for Mrs. Arroyo contended that prosecutors did not prove that the mishandled funds went to her. She had been charged with plunder, which disqualified her for bail, but her lawyers said a spinal problem made her eligible for humanitarian release as she awaited trial.\par \par \uc2 Mrs. Arroyo, 69, is the daughter of a former president of the Philippines, Diosdado P. Macapagal. She attended \uc2 Georgetown University\uc2  at the same time as \uc2 Bill \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , the former United States president, and was a popular senator before being elected vice president in 1998.\par \par \uc2 In 2001, she assumed the presidency after the president at the time, Joseph Estrada, was ousted in the face of corruption allegations. In 2004, she was elected president and served in that post until 2010, when she left office and was elected to Congress. She was re-elected to Congress in May and has served while in detention.\par \par \uc2 Mrs. Arroyo's administration was often the subject of corruption accusations. In 2005, a recording of a phone conversation between Mrs. Arroyo and an \uc2 election\uc2  official, Virgilio Garcillano, known as Garci, appeared to indicate that she had conspired to rig the national elections in 2004. Part of the recording, in which she greets Mr. Garcillano with ''Hello, Garci,'' became a popular ringtone and was used on the horns of some of the colorful jeepneys that ferry commuters.\par \par \uc2 After she was arrested, she claimed that she was a victim of political persecution by her successor, President \uc2 Benigno S. Aquino III\uc2 , who campaigned on the promise of rooting out corruption and jailing political leaders who plundered government coffers.\par \par \uc2 In 2015, the United Nations Working Group on Arbitrary Detention issued an opinion that in light of her medical problems, the refusal to grant bail to Mrs. Arroyo made her detention arbitrary and a violation of international law. The group also stated that Mrs. Arroyo should be compensated for the time spent detained and urged the Aquino administration to reconsider the decision.\par \par \uc2 ''It is my fervent hope that nobody else will suffer the persecution that had been levied on me through self-serving interpretation and implementation of the law,'' Mrs. Arroyo said in a statement released on Tuesday. ''And that the disregard of truth for which I was made to suffer be dealt with accordingly at the soonest possible time.''\par \par \uc2 Mrs. Arroyo is also accused of tampering with the results of congressional elections in 2007, an offense that could result in a prison sentence of 40 years to life.\par \par \uc2 Ferdinand Topacio, a lawyer for Mrs. Arroyo's husband, said he expected that case to be dismissed as well.\par \par \uc2 ''With respect to the electoral case, that is pure and unadulterated 100 percent baloney,'' he said.\par \par \uc2 Follow Floyd Whaley on Twitter @floydwhaley .\par \par \uc2 Document NYTF000020160720ec7k0005u\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw272\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4080\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 REVIEW & OUTLOOK (Editorial)\par \b \uc2 Clinton\uc2  to Madison: Get Me Rewrite\b0\par\par\uc2 386 \uc2 words\par \uc2 20 July 2016\par \uc2 The Wall Street Journal\par \uc2 J\par A14\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  wants to win over Bernie Sanders voters, and on Saturday she bid for them by reinforcing her promise to rewrite the First Amendment to limit political speech that she and they don't like.\par \par \uc2 "Today, I'm announcing that in my first 30 days as President, I will propose a constitutional amendment to overturn \uc2 Citizens United\uc2  and give the American people -- all of us -- the chance to reclaim our democracy," Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  said in a taped speech to the Netroots Nation conference of progressives. First 30 days? Who knew the 225-year-old First Amendment was in need of such urgent revision?\par \par \uc2 Citizens United\uc2  is the 2010 Supreme Court decision that restored the free-speech and association rights of corporations and unions. That decision was rooted, if we can use that word in polite netroots company, in the language of the First Amendment. The constitutional amendment Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  has in mind would have to rewrite James Madison. Dead white males may be out of progressive favor, but we suspect most Americans still trust Madison more than they do the boys at the Daily Kos.\par \par \uc2 Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  knows that such an amendment won't pass, so she also took up the spirit of Justice \uc2 Ruth Bader Ginsburg\uc2 's recent comments that she expects a new liberal majority on the Court to rewrite the First Amendment the easier way. "I'll also appoint Supreme Court justices who understand that this decision was a disaster for our democracy," Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  said. "And I hope some of the brilliant minds in this room will seek out cases to challenge \uc2 Citizens United\uc2  in the courts." So add one more litmus test for Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's Supreme Court nominees.\par \par \uc2 The presumptive Democratic nominee also said she'll press the \uc2 Securities and Exchange Commission\uc2  to require publicly traded companies to disclose all political spending. The point here is to expose companies and CEOs to public vilification and boycotts if they donate to the wrong causes or candidates. Instead of moving to the center, Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  keeps raising the stakes of this \uc2 election\uc2  by moving left.\par \par \uc2 (See related letters: "Letters to the Editor: Changing the Constitution and the Court, Too" -- WSJ July 30, 2016)\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=wjco20160720000044"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document J000000020160720ec7k00011\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 OP-ED COLUMNIST\par \uc2 Editorial Desk; SECTA\par \b \uc2 Ted Loves \uc2 Trump\b0\par\par\uc2 By FRANK BRUNI \par \uc2 855 \uc2 words\par \uc2 20 July 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 23\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 CLEVELAND -- One of the last times you saw Ted Cruz, flames were shooting from his head and spittle was flying from his mouth -- metaphorically, at least -- as he branded \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  ''a pathological liar,'' ''a serial philanderer,'' ''utterly amoral'' and a ''narcissist'' on a level this country had seldom seen. It was the day of Indiana's Republican primary, \uc2 Trump\uc2  had just insinuated a connection between Cruz's father and the assassination of John F. Kennedy, and Cruz announced that he must at long last tell the world ''what I really think'' of \uc2 Trump\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 But when you see the Texas senator on the convention stage here on Wednesday night, that contempt and candor will be absent. He may not exactly praise \uc2 Trump\uc2 , but he'll almost certainly swallow whatever misgivings he still feels, and his presence alone will be taken by some viewers as a gesture of implicit, tentative support.\par \par \uc2 It will also be an example of what he always says he can't stand about other politicians and what voters loathe as well: the elasticity of their convictions, the urgency of their self-interest and the alacrity with which they take an eraser to their past words.\par \par \uc2 There's a lot of erasing going on these days, and \uc2 Trump\uc2  is a big reason. For many Republicans, rallying round him means conveniently forgetting how much they disagreed with or even detested him before, a breach much wider than the one that typically exists between opponents within a political party.\par \par \uc2 Mike Pence\uc2  had to do a memory purge so complete it may well constitute a lobotomy. Once upon a time he deemed \uc2 Trump\uc2 's proposal to ban all Muslims from entering the United States ''offensive and unconstitutional,'' but \uc2 Trump\uc2 's slight tweak to that -- a focus on immigrants from Muslim-heavy countries that seem to be fertile for terrorists -- is something Pence now praises. People say the vice presidency is a miserable job, but what misery politicians go through in pursuit of it.\par \par \uc2 Pence is also among the large crowd of lawmakers whom \uc2 Trump\uc2  savages for having supported the invasion of Iraq. He's an advocate of the trade deals that \uc2 Trump\uc2  mocks. And in that Indiana primary? Pence endorsed Cruz. But now he's all aboard and all about the good ship \uc2 Trump\uc2 , because it has the plusher staterooms and is sailing toward the snazzier port.\par \par \uc2 I shouldn't beat up on Pence. Whatever reservations he expressed about \uc2 Trump\uc2  were mild next to those mentioned by Rick Perry, who called \uc2 Trump\uc2  ''a barking carnival act'' and ''a cancer'' before endorsing him and showing up in support of him here.\par \par \uc2 And it's not just \uc2 Trump\uc2  who brings out the squish in politicians. Their spines jellify in all sorts of situations.\par \par \uc2 Remember \uc2 Marco Rubio\uc2 's insistence that he'd be leaving the Senate after 2016? In May he gave his latest guarantee, tweeting: ''I have only said like 10,000 times I will be a private citizen in January.'' Rubio wasn't just resolute; he was flabbergasted that anyone could doubt his resoluteness. As it turns out, though, a vow doesn't become an ironclad guarantee until it's made 20,000 times. In June, he announced his candidacy for re-\uc2 election\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Pranksters write in disappearing ink; politicians speak in it. And that certainly includes Democrats -- \uc2 Evan Bayh\uc2 , for one. When he left the Senate six years ago, he did so in an indignant, operatically aggrieved fashion, describing it as hopelessly partisan and corrupted by money and outside influences. He then joined the outside influencers, going to work for a lobbying and law firm. But he apparently missed all that partisanship and corruption, because now he wants back in. The negative ads write themselves.\par \par \uc2 Cruz isn't up for re-\uc2 election\uc2  to the Senate until 2018, but what's on his mind is 2020. He clearly began plotting his comeback the moment he exited the Republican primaries. His convention speech will be a part of it and warrants careful study as a road map to where he thinks the post-\uc2 Trump\uc2  G.O.P. is headed.\par \par \uc2 He has even repaired his pride (to the extent that it ever needs repair) and reasserted his dominance by coming up with a conspiracy theory for how the Republican nomination was actually stolen from him -- by the news media! As he explained to \uc2 Politico\uc2 's Glenn Thrush: ''I think many of the mainstream media players are liberal Democrats. They intend to vote for Hillary. They believed Donald was the easiest candidate for Hillary to beat. And I think many of them wanted him to win the nomination. I don't think it was innocent decision making behind this.''\par \par \uc2 I take back what I wrote earlier about his fickleness. He is 100 percent constant -- in his adoration and exaltation of Ted Cruz.\par \par \uc2 I invite you to follow me on Twitter at twitter.com/frankbruni (@FrankBruni) and join me on \uc2 Facebook\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Follow The \uc2 New York Times\uc2  Opinion section on \uc2 Facebook\uc2  and Twitter (@NYTOpinion), and sign up for the Opinion Today newsletter.\par \par \uc2 Document NYTF000020160720ec7k0003h\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky sometimes struggles to work up much enthusiasm for \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2 . But he can definitely get excited about the opportunity to trash \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 In his appearance at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland on Tuesday as one of several members of Congress scheduled to speak, Mr. McConnell, the majority leader, is expected to slam the presumptive Democratic nominee.\par \par \uc2 A campaign aide to Mr. McConnell said the senator would focus on what he saw as Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's record of failed policies and a willingness to do anything to get elected. He will argue that the case for casting a presidential vote is an easy one, particularly given the Republican desire to maintain the conservative tilt of the Supreme Court. He will also touch on one of his favorite topics: that the Senate, controlled by Republicans, is much more productive than it was under a Democratic majority.\par \par \uc2 While some Republican senators in tough re-\uc2 election\uc2  fights have decided to pass on the party convention, there is still a fairly strong contingent in town. Joining Mr. McConnell in speaking on Tuesday will be Senator Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia and Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, who is in a tough re-\uc2 election\uc2  battle. Others joined Mr. McConnell at events with campaign donors Sunday night and Monday afternoon.\par \par \uc2 ''The turnout was greater than I expected,'' said Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine, who spent a few days in Cleveland.\par \par \uc2 The House will be represented on the convention stage on Tuesday, as well, with speeches by Speaker Paul D. Ryan and Representative Kevin McCarthy of California, the No. 2 Republican in the House.\par \par \uc2 Find out what you need to know about the 2016 presidential race today, and get politics news updates via \uc2 Facebook\uc2 , \uc2 Twitter\uc2  and the First Draft newsletter.\par \par \uc2 Document NYTF000020160720ec7k0004m\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Among the Republicans going along with \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2 's takeover of their party, the House speaker, \uc2 Paul Ryan\uc2 , has made a tortuous art -- a zigzag of maybes, yes-buts and oh, I guess sos -- of protecting his interests en route to capitulating to the inevitable at the nominating convention.\par \par \uc2 By supporting the \uc2 Trump\uc2  candidacy, Mr. Ryan has revealed himself to be a weak opportunist, far from the ideas man and budget wonk he made himself out to be when he secured the vice-presidential nomination four years ago. It probably hasn't been easy to engage in the political casuistry needed to simultaneously reject and embrace Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 While condemning Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's more hateful utterances, Mr. Ryan has been careful never, ever to criticize Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  himself. ''It's not what this country stands for,'' Mr. Ryan said of Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's outrageous call to ban Muslims from entering the nation, yet he failed to challenge the person who said it.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Ryan denounced Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's attack on an Indiana-born judge of Mexican heritage as ''the textbook definition of a racist comment.'' He added: ''It's absolutely unacceptable. But do I believe that \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  is the answer? No, I do not.'' Thus goes his justification for abandoning principles and good sense: The bizarre excesses of Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  -- racism, xenophobia, paleo-protectionism -- are nothing compared with the prospect of Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  winning the White House.\par \par \uc2 Unlike Mr. Ryan, other Republican leaders have backed away from Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  as a candidate gone amok, notably \uc2 Mitt Romney\uc2 , the presidential candidate who campaigned alongside Mr. Ryan. Even John Kasich, the convention's host governor, has felt obliged to boycott the celebration of Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 . In contrast, Mr. Ryan seems to be trying to look just loyal enough to avoid blame for a \uc2 Clinton\uc2  victory while positioning himself to pick up the pieces of the party if Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  loses. But he cannot have this both ways. He is tying his future to Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's ugly campaign.\par \par \uc2 Even before the credibility challenge presented by the \uc2 Trump\uc2  candidacy, Mr. Ryan's reputation as a congressional thinker and innovator was subject to increasing doubts, as was his leadership of fractious House Republicans in their failure to agree on basic budget resolutions. Their \uc2 election\uc2  year agenda, called ''A Better Way,'' has been widely criticized for lacking detail in its claims about curtailing poverty. Last month, after years of vowing to come up with a replacement for the Affordable Care Act, Mr. Ryan's caucus finally offered a proposal. Far from being innovative, the plan was built around Mr. Ryan's longstanding proposals to shift Medicare to a market-based competitor of health care companies.\par \par \uc2 Under scrutiny, Mr. Ryan's prescriptions for reforms and savings have proved to be glossy variations on the tired Republican tactic of more tax cuts favoring the rich over the middle class, while his budget-cutting proposals have never added up to his grand promises.\par \par \uc2 As a conservative policy leader, Mr. Ryan should have every reason to oppose Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 . They hold different positions on core issues, including on immigration (Mr. Ryan opposes Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's call for 11 million deportations), trade deals (Mr. Ryan supports the Pacific trade deal that Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  has vilified) and international engagement (the speaker favors a stronger \uc2 NATO\uc2  and wariness toward Russia, while Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  seems ready to embrace isolationism).\par \par \uc2 A cynic would say Mr. Ryan has nothing to lose: Either he gets the bombastic, unpredictable Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  as the next president or he survives to seek the presidential nomination in 2020. But whatever the outcome, Mr. Ryan seems already to be what Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  typically calls a loser -- a once promising politician who has lost his way.\par \par \uc2 Follow The \uc2 New York Times\uc2  Opinion section on \uc2 Facebook\uc2  and \uc2 Twitter\uc2  (@NYTOpinion), and sign up for the Opinion Today newsletter.\par \par \uc2 DRAWING (DRAWING BY JOAN WONG) \par \par \uc2 Document NYTF000020160720ec7k00070\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 Politics; SECT\par \b \uc2 Republican Convention: Here's What You Missed\b0\par\par\uc2 By DAVID E. SANGER, MICHAEL D. SHEAR and NICHOLAS FANDOS \par \uc2 639 \uc2 words\par \uc2 20 July 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 The New York Times on the Web\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 CLEVELAND -- \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2  is officially the Republican presidential nominee and tonight's focus -- ostensibly, at least -- was on jobs and the economy.\par \par \uc2 Here are the highlights:\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  showed up -- virtually, from New York, on a Jumbotron to unofficially accept the nomination at little after 9 p.m. But for him, it was both a bit of a wooden and constrained appearance.\par \par \uc2 He watched on TV as his children helped put him over the top, he said, but gave little of substance, without mentioning \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 _____\par \par \uc2 For a guy who was passed over for the vice-presidential nomination, and seemed to be kicked around by the \uc2 Trump\uc2  campaign at every turn, \uc2 Gov. Chris Christie\uc2  of New Jersey was the star of the second night.\par \par \uc2 For about 15 minutes, he laid out one short indictment of Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  after another, asking after each, ''Guilty or not guilty?'' It was part red meat, part courtroom procedural, and with each query, ''GUILTY!'' resonated through the hall, interrupted only by an occasional ''Lock her up!''\par \par \uc2 _____\par \par \uc2 For several painful minutes, \uc2 Paul Ryan\uc2 , the House speaker, name-checked Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , always linking him to \uc2 Mike Pence\uc2 , the Republican vice-presidential nominee, and he acknowledged, with some understatement, that ''we Republicans have had our differences this year.'' He focused on skewering Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Fact Check: He said poverty has gotten worse during the almost eight years of the Obama administration. In fact, the poverty rate did increase in 2009, after he took office, largely as a result of the economic collapse of the previous year. It increased in 2009 to 14.3 percent from 13.2 percent -- largely during George W. Bush's presidency. It peaked under Obama at about 15 percent, but fell to about 14.5 percent last year, according to the Census Bureau.\par \par \uc2 _____\par \par \uc2 Ben Carson, the retired neurosurgeon who competed against Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  for the nomination, dismissed those who have said they would be willing to stomach a \uc2 Clinton\uc2  presidency to avoid Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 ''They're not using their God-given brain to think about what they are saying,'' he said. Rather, the \uc2 election\uc2  is not about Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  or any other politician, but about the people rising up ''to take America back.''\par \par \uc2 _____\par \par \uc2 Tiffany \uc2 Trump\uc2 , Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's youngest daughter, talked about the ''sweet notes'' he wrote on her childhood report cards; the looks of surprise on her friends' faces when they would meet the real, ''considerate'' Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 ; and a call she once received from him after the death of someone close to her.\par \par \uc2 ''For me, the measure of a parent is based on how they support and bolster you when you're down.,'' she said.\par \par \uc2 _____\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's eldest son and close adviser, Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  Jr., echoed earlier speakers in warning of how liberal elites had steered the country off course. But he also balanced personal lessons from his father with Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's familiar populist rallying cries, declaring that his father's hard-nosed, gritty ambition would put ordinary Americans back in control.\par \par \uc2 _____\par \par \uc2 Maybe it was the multiple shootings over the last several weeks. But there seemed to be a muted reception for Chris Cox, the executive director of the National Rifle Association, who warned that the right to own a gun will be threatened if Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  was elected.\par \par \uc2 This earned him at least a modest response: ''A Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  Supreme Court means your right to own a firearm is gone,'' Mr. Cox said. ''Make no mistake, this \uc2 election\uc2  is not about the next four years. It's about the next 40 years.''\par \par \uc2 Find out what you need to know about the 2016 presidential race today, and get politics news updates via \uc2 Facebook\uc2 , \uc2 Twitter\uc2  and the First Draft newsletter.\par \par \uc2 Document NYTF000020160720ec7k00052\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 National Desk; SECTA\par \b \uc2 Trump\uc2  Claims Nomination, With Discord Clear but Family Cheering\b0\par\par\uc2 By ALEXANDER BURNS and JONATHAN MARTIN \par \uc2 1,310 \uc2 words\par \uc2 20 July 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 11\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 CLEVELAND -- \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2  was formally crowned the Republican nominee for president at the party's convention on Tuesday, ending a tumultuous primary season but not the nagging questions about his polarizing candidacy as he once again found himself embroiled in controversy.\par \par \uc2 With his campaign appearing in disarray after his wife, Melania, delivered a convention speech cribbed in part from one once given by Michelle Obama, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  officially claimed the nomination. But the gap between Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  and the party he now aims to lead yawned as wide as ever across the convention.\par \par \uc2 At times, the only unifying appeals -- the only themes truly capable of rallying the Republican Party, even briefly -- were ominous denunciations of \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 . \uc2 Gov. Chris Christie\uc2  of New Jersey, a \uc2 Trump\uc2  ally stung by his rejection in the hunt to be Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's running mate, rebounded with a call to arms against Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Casting himself as her prosecutor in a mock trial, Mr. Christie roused the crowd to spontaneous chants of ''Lock her up!''\par \par \uc2 But such moments of unity passed quickly in an evening that showcased the Republican Party's crippling divisions from the start. In the roll call vote that began the night, formally marking Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's capture of the Republican nomination, 721 delegates cast their votes for candidates other than Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  -- the most significant expression of party dissent since 1976, when Republicans had a contested convention.\par \par \uc2 And if more traditional Republicans in the audience showed limited enthusiasm for Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , the misgivings were mutual: Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, drew scattered boos from the crowd in multiple appearances on stage. Mr. McConnell, who has both endorsed Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  and criticized his campaign, offered a restrained embrace on Tuesday, stressing in his remarks that Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  would sign laws passed by the Republican-held Senate.\par \par \uc2 Speaker Paul D. Ryan, who was reluctant to endorse Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , was more direct in his remarks over the party's rift -- what he called ''our arguments this year.'' But, Mr. Ryan said, ''democracy is a series of choices.''\par \par \uc2 The mood of the event careened uneasily back and forth, from exultant celebrations cheered on by the \uc2 Trump\uc2  family to sober discourses on conservative policy guided by Republican congressional leaders to attacks on Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 While Mr. Ryan, representing the G.O.P.'s governing wing, laid out a vision for ''a reformed tax code that rewards free enterprise,'' Ben Carson, the physician who briefly caught fire last year in his presidential campaign, used part of his address to claim that Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  is a student of \uc2 Saul Alinsky\uc2 , the 20th-century activist and community organizer.\par \par \uc2 The roll call itself was punctuated with signals of discontent. When Ohio cast 66 delegate votes for its governor, John Kasich, a chorus of intermingled cheers and boos rose from the crowd. Mr. Kasich, a Republican, has not endorsed Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  and has been a pointed critic of his political style.\par \par \uc2 At another juncture in the roll call, another Republican governor who has not backed Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , \uc2 Susana Martinez\uc2  of New Mexico, appeared poised to reconcile with the Republican nominee.\par \par \uc2 But as she stepped forward to cast her state's votes, Ms. Martinez passed on a chance to publicly back Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 . Instead she passed the microphone to a young member of the New Mexico delegation, who spoke in her stead to hail Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Alphabetically, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's home state was next up, but it delayed casting its votes so that it would be the one that put Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  over the 1,237-delegate threshold. His son Donald Jr. announced on the convention floor that New York's delegates had delivered the votes he needed.\par \par \uc2 ''It's not a campaign anymore, it's a movement,'' said the younger Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , surrounded by his three adult siblings. Reflecting his father's brashness, he pledged to put New York, which has not voted Republican in a presidential \uc2 election\uc2  in 32 years, in play.\par \par \uc2 The hall echoed with the strains of ''New York, New York.'' Giant screens hanging over the arena glittered with an animation of gold fireworks and a three-word proclamation: ''Over the Top.''\par \par \uc2 Amid the celebration, some delegates remained seated and other seats on the floor were entirely empty. In big sections of the mezzanine, row upon row of red-backed seats stood mostly vacant.\par \par \uc2 The passionless tone that prevailed for most of the evening made Mr. Christie's chest-thumping speech all the more noteworthy. For the second consecutive night, long stretches of the program were desultory, and the convention floor emptied out well before the speeches ended.\par \par \uc2 Having sputtered in his own run for the White House in 2016 and facing disappointment in his bid for second place on the ticket, Mr. Christie nevertheless gave the crowd his all.\par \par \uc2 Unlike in 2012, when Mr. Christie turned his keynote address at the Republican convention into a paean to his own political success, this time he spoke briefly of his friendship with Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  before savaging Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  as a criminal in all but name. It is time for the country to be led, he said, ''not only by a strong leader, but by a caring, genuine and decent person.''\par \par \uc2 Still, there was unmistakable evidence that other prominent Republicans were eyeing 2020 campaigns with the expectation that the party would lose the White House this fall. While Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  was being formally nominated as the party's standard-bearer, his most formidable rival from the primary campaign, Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, mingled with donors and activists at a reception in a restaurant across the street from the convention arena.\par \par \uc2 And as if to hand Republicans uneasy with Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's candidacy new reasons to be skeptical, his campaign offered a halting response on Tuesday to questions about why Ms. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's speech featured passages from Mrs. Obama's 2008 address at the Democratic convention. The controversy clouded the second day of the Republican convention and was a reminder that despite attempts to bolster his campaign, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  continues to be plagued by stumbles.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's former campaign manager, \uc2 Corey Lewandowski\uc2 , said the staff member who succeeded him and helped engineer his ouster, \uc2 Paul Manafort\uc2 , should be terminated over the plagiarism. That suggestion prompted a harsh response from Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  Jr., who suggested in a \uc2 CBS\uc2  interview that Mr. Lewandowski was trying to ''maintain relevance.''\par \par \uc2 ''There is a reason Paul is in the position that he is today and Corey is not, and it is not because Paul is amateur hour,'' said the younger Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 It was all a headache for Republicans trying to rally support for Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 . ''Some staffer screwed up. Let's move on,'' said Curt Smith, a Christian conservative leader in Indiana and close friend of \uc2 Gov. Mike Pence\uc2 , who was formally nominated as Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's running mate on Tuesday.\par \par \uc2 Asked if the campaign should take responsibility for the flap to bring questions to a halt, Mr. Smith shot back: ''That would be good.''\par \par \uc2 Find out what you need to know about the 2016 presidential race today, and get politics news updates via \uc2 Facebook\uc2 , \uc2 Twitter\uc2  and the First Draft newsletter.\par \par \uc2 Paul D. Ryan, the House speaker, as seen from the arena's concourse in Cleveland on Tuesday, spoke at the convention about the Republican Party's rift.

Chris Christie of New Jersey, right, denounced Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , casting himself as her prosecutor in a mock trial and rousing the crowd to chants of, ''Lock her up!''

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 To the Editor:\par \par \uc2 Re ''Can We Find Our Way Back to Lincoln?'' (Sunday Review, July 17):\par \par \uc2 Peter Wehner is correct that the Republican Party has some real soul-searching to do as a result of this \uc2 election\uc2  cycle and the rise of \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2 . The G.O.P.'s enthusiastic acceptance of the Tea Party and equally enthusiastic use of Fox News as the voice of the party tilled the soil and planted the seeds that led to Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 It is not too late for the G.O.P. to learn from this enormous mistake and to create anew a party that stands for the principles that Mr. Wehner believes it stands for, and to demand that those whose core principles do not align form their own third party.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Wehner and his ilk will succeed in reshaping their party only by splitting with Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  and his supporters. Some, like the entire Bush family, have decided that their stomachs will not allow them to participate in this charade any longer; perhaps there will be enough of them to actually save the G.O.P.\par \par \uc2 BROOKE MAGID HART\par \par \uc2 Minneapolis\par \par \uc2 To the Editor:\par \par \uc2 Peter Wehner, in his thought-provoking article, urges the Republican Party to examine its values and heed the lessons of Abe Lincoln. I am a third-generation Republican who believes that we must work to enlarge the G.O.P. tent. We need to get back to the meat-and-potatoes issues of economic development and international trade.\par \par \uc2 Bullying, classism, racism, sexism and divisive politics do not have a place in our party. I chose to work for Abe Lincoln's vision of our party and country. Hopefully, whatever happens on \uc2 Election\uc2  Day, folks will join the journey to reclaim and expand the Republican tent.\par \par \uc2 PETE WEBB\par \par \uc2 New York\par \par \uc2 To the Editor:\par \par \uc2 Peter Wehner sets a new standard for self-serving historical amnesia. He wants to think of his party as ''comprising mostly honorable individuals working to advance an agenda they believed was in the national interest.'' Where has he been since 1964?\par \par \uc2 His Republican Party began its courtship of the racist, nativist, America-first element of the electorate in earnest that year by nominating a candidate, Barry Goldwater, who voted against the Civil Rights Act. Then came Richard Nixon in 1968 with his ''Southern strategy.''\par \par \uc2 The supposedly decent Ronald Reagan kicked off his 1980 presidential campaign in the Mississippi town where three civil rights activists were killed, making crystal clear to everyone where he stood on the issue of race in America. Then came the supposedly decent George H. W. Bush, he of the Willie Horton campaign ad.\par \par \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2 's base has been the Republican base, and his agenda at the center of the Republican agenda, for more than 50 years now. The only difference is that the level of vulgarity has risen. I do not see this agenda as being ''in the national interest.''\par \par \uc2 I'm astonished that Mr. Wehner can claim to be the slightest bit surprised at Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's ascendancy.\par \par
