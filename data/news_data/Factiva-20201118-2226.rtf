\par\par \uc2 National Desk; SECTA\par \b \uc2 Victory in Sight, \uc2 Clinton\uc2  Presses Beyond \uc2 Trump\b0\par\par\uc2 By ALEXANDER BURNS and AMY CHOZICK; Nick Corasaniti contributed reporting. \par \uc2 1,432 \uc2 words\par \uc2 24 October 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 1\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  moved aggressively on Sunday to press her advantage in the presidential race, urging black voters in North Carolina to vote early and punish Republican officeholders for supporting \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , even as Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's party increasingly concedes he is unlikely to recover in the polls.\par \par \uc2 Aiming to turn her edge over Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  into an unbreakable lead, Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  has been pleading with core Democratic constituencies to get out and vote in states where balloting has already begun. By running up a lead well in advance of the Nov. 8 \uc2 election\uc2  in states like North Carolina and Florida, she could virtually eliminate Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's ability to make a late comeback.\par \par \uc2 At times, Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  is going beyond seeking simply a victory over Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , asking voters to strengthen her hand in Congress and repudiate not just Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  but also Republicans who have accommodated or endorsed him.\par \par \uc2 After lashing Senator Patrick J. Toomey of Pennsylvania in a speech on Saturday, Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  urged voters at an outdoor rally on Sunday in Raleigh, N.C., to elect a Democratic governor and to turn Senator Richard M. Burr out of office.\par \par \uc2 Calling Mr. Burr's Democratic challenger, Deborah Ross, ''exactly the kind of partner I need in the \uc2 United States Senate\uc2 ,'' Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  upbraided Mr. Burr for failing to reject Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 ''Unlike her opponent, Deborah has never been afraid to stand up to \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2 ,'' Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  said, adding, ''She knows that people of courage and principles need to come together to reject this dangerous and divisive agenda.''\par \par \uc2 It is a sign of the extraordinarily lopsided nature of the presidential race that, even in a Republican-controlled state like North Carolina, Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  is in a position to exhort voters to hand control of the Senate to Democrats. Though she is still not broadly popular, Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  has cast her candidacy -- and now, perhaps, her party -- as a safe harbor for voters across the political mainstream who find Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  intolerable.\par \par \uc2 Seeming to peer past the end of the race, Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  offered herself as a figure of conciliation during a visit on Sunday to a black church in Raleigh.\par \par \uc2 ''There are many people in our country willing to reach across the divide, regardless of what you've heard in this campaign,'' she said.\par \par \uc2 For Republicans, blunting Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's ability to carry other Democrats into office has become the overriding imperative in the final weeks of the 2016 race. With Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  so diminished as a competitor for Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , Republicans say they will now ask voters in newly explicit terms to elect a divided government rather than giving Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  unchecked power.\par \par \uc2 The Congressional Leadership Fund, a powerful ''super PAC'' that supports Republicans in the House of Representatives, is to begin running ads in the coming days that attack Democratic candidates as ''rubber stamps'' for Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  and urge voters in swing districts to support Republicans instead.\par \par \uc2 Mike Shields, the group's president, said it had tested that message and found it effective in closely contested races, even with voters who are likely to support Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  over Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 ''There are many districts where we are going to be running ads that talk about the Democrat being a rubber stamp for \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 ,'' Mr. Shields said. ''In many districts, it is a very, very potent weapon to use against a Democratic candidate for Congress.''\par \par \uc2 Republicans fear Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  will do grievous damage to the party unless he can close the yawning gap with Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  in the presidential race. An ABC News tracking poll published on Sunday showed him trailing Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  by 12 percentage points nationally and drawing just 38 percent of the vote.\par \par \uc2 Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , who drew support from 50 percent of voters in the poll, was openly dismissive of Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  over the weekend, telling reporters on Saturday that she no longer worried about answering his attacks. ''I debated him for four and a half hours,'' she said. ''I don't even think about responding to him anymore.''\par \par \uc2 Karl Rove, the chief strategist of George W. Bush's successful presidential campaigns, said on Sunday on Fox News that he no longer believed Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  had a realistic path to victory against Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 ''I don't see it happening,'' Mr. Rove said.\par \par \uc2 In addition to trailing by a wide margin in national polls, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  has fallen well behind Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  in states that are likely to determine control of the Senate, including North Carolina, Nevada, Pennsylvania, Florida and New Hampshire, and also in suburban areas around the country that are critical to the Republicans' House majority.\par \par \uc2 Two outside groups aligned with Republicans, the \uc2 U.S. Chamber of Commerce\uc2  and the Senate Leadership Fund, have also begun running television commercials in Senate races that imply Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  is likely to be the next president and ask voters to limit her power by supporting Republicans.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's campaign manager, Kellyanne Conway, acknowledged on \uc2 NBC\uc2 's ''Meet the Press'' that Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  was trailing. She said the campaign had ''a shot'' at winning over undecided voters who do not now support Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  but who dislike Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 But Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  has made little effort in recent days to deliver a sharply honed campaign message or to address the flaws at the core of his candidacy. In his public remarks, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  has delivered an insular and self-referential closing message, dwelling on personal frustrations at the expense of any wider appeal to voters. In a speech on Saturday that was intended to outline his closing message in the race, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  instead began by threatening to sue the women who have come forward to say that he had sexually assaulted them.\par \par \uc2 Campaigning on Sunday in Florida, where early voting is set to begin in most counties on Monday, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  attacked Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's national security record, but swerved repeatedly from his script. At one point, he suggested that the American-backed offensive to retake Mosul, Iraq, from the Islamic State was merely an effort by President Obama to ''show what a tough guy he is before the \uc2 election\uc2 .''\par \par \uc2 And Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  appeared to acknowledge the growing separation between him and other Republicans, even as he asked voters to elect a friendly Congress and help him ''re-elect Republicans all over the place.''\par \par \uc2 ''I hope they help me, too,'' Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  said in Naples, Fla. ''It would be nice if they help us, too, right? To enact my first 100 days.''\par \par \uc2 While there are two weeks of campaigning left in the race, the window for Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  to resurrect his candidacy grows slimmer by the day, now that voting is underway in a number of important states.\par \par \uc2 Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  is expected to spend two days this week in Florida, and to return to North Carolina for an event with \uc2 Michelle Obama\uc2 , the first lady, in a bid to lock down two states without which Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  has no realistic route to the White House.\par \par \uc2 Her campaign has deployed surrogates across the map, including in Republican-leaning states like Arizona, where former Representative Gabrielle Giffords and her husband, Mark Kelly -- leading gun-control advocates who have strongly backed Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  -- were headlining a get-out-the-vote event on Sunday in Tucson. Mr. Kelly said Arizona had become a ''winnable state'' for Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , but said Democrats could not take anything for granted.\par \par \uc2 ''It is not over by any stretch,'' Mr. Kelly, a retired astronaut, said in an interview. ''Strange things can happen in elections, and polling numbers can move very fast, and people can get complacent.''\par \par \uc2 At a Raleigh church a few hours earlier, Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  appeared with a group of mothers who had lost their children through gun violence or interactions with the police, to deliver much the same message.\par \par \uc2 Geneva Reed-Veal, whose daughter, Sandra Bland, died in a Texas jail after a traffic stop last year, called on the congregation to make its voice heard at the polls.\par \par \uc2 ''If you decide not to vote,'' Ms. Reed-Veal said, ''shut your mouth.''\par \par \uc2 Find out what you need to know about the 2016 presidential race today, and get politics news updates via \uc2 Facebook\uc2 , \uc2 Twitter\uc2  and the First Draft newsletter.\par \par \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  on Sunday in Raleigh, N.C. At a black church in the city, she said she would try to bring the country together.

President \uc2 Obama\uc2 , who has endured gridlock in Washington as Republicans in the states took direct aim at his vision and legacy, is stepping in to assist more than 150 state legislative candidates, by far his biggest effort to bolster local Democrats since he took office.\par \par \uc2 ''You are going to see a level of engagement down to the state representative level that I don't think you've seen too many presidents engage in,'' said David Simas, the director of the White House's Office of Political Strategy and Outreach.\par \par \uc2 Still, Democrats have a long way to go. Republicans effectively control 68 of the nation's 99 statehouse chambers, compared with 36 at the start of 2010. For years, Democrats complained that Mr. Obama and his political operation paid too little attention to the health of the party, and during his tenure, more than 800 Democratic state lawmakers have been voted out of office, among the worst losses for the party under any president in more than 100 years.\par \par \uc2 Republicans control at least 22 capitals entirely, holding governors' offices as well as legislatures. Seven years ago, they had complete control of nine.\par \par \uc2 Matt Walter, the president of the Republican State Leadership Committee, acknowledged that his party was facing a challenge. ''When you're at an all-time-high number in the legislatures, naturally you have a lot more ground to defend,'' he said.\par \par \uc2 The volatile state of the presidential \uc2 election\uc2  has also muddied predictions about who will go to the polls on Nov. 8 and what that will mean for races to elect more than 5,900 state lawmakers and 12 governors.\par \par \uc2 ''This is an opportunity year for the Democrats, and that's more true now than it was two weeks ago,'' said Tim Storey, an elections expert with the National Conference of State Legislatures who tracks state legislative contests. ''But the question mark is turnout. The presidential race has made it really hard to know what's going to get people to the polls or what's going to keep them away.''\par \par \uc2 Here in Faribault, an hour south of the Twin Cities, Patti Fritz, a Democrat, has seen the puzzle over turnout up close. Ms. Fritz, whose effort to win back a seat in the Minnesota House of Representatives could help her party retake full control of the capital, recalled meeting a woman at a grocery store who said she was so disillusioned by the presidential \uc2 election\uc2  that she was considering not voting. Maybe she would vote for Jesus, she said.\par \par \uc2 ''Well, write him in for president,'' Ms. Fritz said she urged the woman, ''and then go down further and vote for me.''\par \par \uc2 Democrats hope Mr. Obama's involvement, which began in earnest last week, broadens their chances. Dozens of candidates for state posts were getting word of the support only last week. In Minnesota, Mr. Obama is backing Jamie Becker-Finn in her campaign for a different State House seat. Jos\u233\'00\'E9 Javier Rodr\u237\'00\'EDguez, a state representative in Florida, hopes Mr. Obama can help him move to the State Senate. And in Georgia, Mr. Obama recorded an automated telephone call to support keeping Kimberly Alexander in the State House seat she won in 2012.\par \par \uc2 ''This is \uc2 Barack Obama\uc2 , urging you to get to the polls to vote for the candidate who has my back, and yours: Kimberly Alexander,'' he says in the call. ''Thanks. Go vote!''\par \par \uc2 Mr. Simas, the White House political strategy director, said Mr. Obama was motivated in part by a deepening frustration with conservative legislation passed in statehouses. In North Carolina, lawmakers restricted bathroom use by transgender people. Republican-led states across the country have passed hundreds of restrictive abortion laws. Many Republican-led legislatures have sought to toughen voter identification laws. And the Republicans' sweep into power has led to redrawn political maps, often creating tougher challenges for Democrats.\par \par \uc2 Even after Mr. Obama leaves the White House, officials said, he will lend support to \uc2 Eric H. Holder Jr\uc2 ., his former attorney general, who is leading a new group aimed at helping Democrats win redistricting fights in 2020. Democrats hope to avoid a repeat of 2010, when Republicans' control of legislatures put them in a position to reshape districts in their favor for a decade.\par \par \uc2 In addition to statehouses, a surprisingly large number of governors' races -- as many as seven -- are seen as up for grabs, including some that could alter control of capitals. If John Gregg, a Democrat, wins a tight race to replace \uc2 Mike Pence\uc2  as governor of Indiana, that state's Republican-controlled Legislature will face roadblocks to its agenda. The same will be true in North Carolina if Attorney General \uc2 Roy Cooper\uc2 , another Democrat, wins.\par \par \uc2 In Missouri, a victory for Eric Greitens, the Republican nominee for governor, would end divided rule in Jefferson City, potentially easing Republican lawmakers' efforts to pass measures such as ''right to work'' legislation. If Phil Scott, a Republican, becomes governor of Vermont, Democrats will no longer have total control of Montpelier and will most likely be derailed in their push for paid family leave and renewable energy development.\par \par \uc2 But the far larger number of state legislative contests could have a broader effect. At least 20 chambers are seen as highly competitive in the \uc2 election\uc2 , and a majority of those are now controlled by Republicans. Democrats are setting their sights on chambers not only in Minnesota but also in states like Maine, New Mexico and New York. Republicans hope to hold control and extend their reach in places like Iowa, Kentucky and Washington.\par \par \uc2 Such races are often decided by a few hundred votes or fewer, so turnout is essential -- and, this year, a muddle. Democrats say their state candidates will benefit if Republicans appalled by Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  stay home. Republicans, though, say his core supporters are more motivated to vote than others, particularly given negative views of \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 ''In a lot of our areas where we are going on offense, he is extremely popular and \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  is extremely unpopular,'' said Jonathan Shell, a state representative from Kentucky, where Republicans have not held a majority in the House since the 1920s. Mr. Shell, a farmer who has worked to recruit Republican candidates, believes frustration over lost coal mining jobs and enthusiasm for Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  may finally help change that.\par \par \uc2 Democrats anticipate a different \uc2 Trump\uc2  effect. They have begun demanding that Republican opponents take stances on Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  and address his lewd remarks about women and allegations that he sexually assaulted women.\par \par \uc2 ''Do these Republicans step away from him and hold on to their socially conservative base, or do they double down on \uc2 Trump\uc2  and stay with him?'' said Jessica Post, the executive director of the Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee.\par \par \uc2 The pressure is intensifying for them to make a decision. In some districts, voters are getting recorded phone calls insisting that local Republicans must either reject Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  or be considered in support of him. In Washington State, where Republicans need two additional seats to win control of the House, Lynnette Vehrs issued a blunt question to her Republican opponent: ''Do you condone the words and actions of \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2 , and how can you continue to stand by him?''\par \par \uc2 Risks for Republicans, even at the bottom of the ticket, are clear: Alienate Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's voters or alienate those perturbed by his behavior. ''At this point, you really are trying to run out the clock,'' said David Flaherty, a Republican pollster and the chief executive of Magellan Strategies, based in Colorado, where Republicans are trying to hold or expand a one-seat majority in the Senate. ''You're damned if you do, and you're damned if you don't.''\par \par \uc2 With control of the Minnesota House at stake, radio ads are nearly constant in Faribault. Politicians from far-flung districts drive in to help. And Ms. Fritz, who faces a rematch with \uc2 Brian Daniels\uc2 , the Republican who defeated her two years ago by 221 votes, is calling on volunteers from this small city's growing Somali and Hispanic populations to knock on doors.\par \par \uc2 This month, Mr. Daniels explained his feelings about Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  this way: ''He wasn't one of my first dozen choices, but what gives me hope is he picked a really good vice-presidential candidate.''\par \par \uc2 In a bitter wind, Mr. Daniels drove a golf cart around a subdivision to talk to voters. At one door, he spoke of his time in office -- two years when a newly Republican-held State House at times blocked Democrats, who control the rest of the capital, from rushing ideas through. He told the resident that his colleagues had slowed state spending increases. He said they had prevented a gas tax increase.\par \par \uc2 He did not mention Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Patti Fritz, left, a Democrat, is trying to regain a seat in the Minnesota House of Representatives.; Brian Daniels, a Republican who defeated Ms. Fritz two years ago by 221 votes, is facing her again.

\par\par \uc2 Metropolitan Desk; SECTA\par \b \uc2 G.O.P. Hopefuls in State Congressional Races Walk Tightrope on \uc2 Trump\b0\par\par\uc2 By WILLIAM NEUMAN; Jesse McKinley contributed reporting from Albany. \par \uc2 1,565 \uc2 words\par \uc2 24 October 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 16\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 In a normal year, down-ballot candidates in the home state of their party's presidential nominee count on \uc2 Election\uc2  Day to provide a big boost from voters energized to send their candidate to the White House.\par \par \uc2 But nothing this year is normal.\par \par \uc2 Assemblywoman Claudia Tenney, a conservative Republican running for Congress in upstate New York, has consistently said she will vote for her party's presidential candidate, \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , who has polled strongly against \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  among voters in her district.\par \par \uc2 But ads for Ms. Tenney that began airing this month suggest instead that Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  is a lost cause: The ads urge voters to elect her because ''she'll stand up to \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 .''\par \par \uc2 In New York State and elsewhere, candidates and political operatives are trying to gauge the effect that the constant swirl of controversy around Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  will have on close races like Ms. Tenney's -- an even more intense exercise since the release of Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's recorded boasts of groping women and accusations from several women that he touched them inappropriately.\par \par \uc2 In some areas where Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  remains popular, Republican hopefuls must walk a tightrope between expressing support for him and distancing themselves from a candidate who may become toxic to the moderates and independents they need to win.\par \par \uc2 ''It's definitely a very unique \uc2 election\uc2  cycle and run for president,'' said Kim Myers, a Democrat running against Ms. Tenney in the 22nd District, which includes Utica and Binghamton. ''Most of the people I talk to are very upset at what's happening on the presidential level.''\par \par \uc2 Analysts said the so-called \uc2 Trump\uc2  effect could play out in different ways in different parts of the state. Where Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  remains popular, voters could reward candidates who remain loyal to him. But elsewhere, his low standing with moderates, women and college-educated voters could tip close races to Democrats, and make otherwise safe Republican seats competitive.\par \par \uc2 ''It's not that Hillary will sway them; it's that \uc2 Trump\uc2  will scare them,'' Susan Del Percio, a Republican strategist, said. Perhaps the greatest fear for Republicans is that Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  could have a negative effect on turnout.\par \par \uc2 ''If Republican women are so turned off by \uc2 Trump\uc2  that they can't come out and vote for him and they can't vote for her,'' she said, ''are they going to say these other candidates represent change, or are they going to say just forget the whole lot?''\par \par \uc2 The race in the 22nd District is unusual because it also includes a well-financed independent candidate, Martin Babinec, a wealthy technology sector businessman. A recent Time Warner Cable News/Siena College poll showed Ms. Tenney with support from 35 percent of voters surveyed, with Ms. Myers at 30 percent and Mr. Babinec at 24 percent. In the poll, released on Sept. 29, before Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's boasts about groping women became public, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  led Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  by 11 points in the district.\par \par \uc2 ''Voters are not only angry and frustrated, but are asking questions about how did we find ourselves in this situation,'' Mr. Babinec said, adding that the ''\uc2 election\uc2  drama at the top of the ticket raised interest and appetite for the value of an independent candidate.''\par \par \uc2 In August, after Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  criticized the family of a Muslim-American soldier killed in Iraq, Ms. Tenney was quoted as saying that he had crossed a line. But she said she would still vote for him because he was preferable to Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Ms. Tenney did not respond to requests for an interview, but her spokeswoman, Hannah Andrews, said Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's comments about groping women had not changed her position. ''She says she will vote for him and supports him,'' Ms. Andrews said.\par \par \uc2 But an ad running on Ms. Tenney's behalf, paid for by the National Republican Congressional Committee, sounds a very different note. It makes no mention of Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , warns ominously about the Islamic State and job losses, and says Ms. Myers would be a rubber stamp for Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  -- implying that she will be the next president.\par \par \uc2 The 22nd District is one of many across the country seen as crucial to both parties' congressional hopes. It is currently represented by a Republican, Representative Richard L. Hanna, who is retiring. Mr. Hanna, perhaps freed by not having to run for re-\uc2 election\uc2 , has denounced Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  and said he plans to vote for Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Another race that appears very close is New York's 19th District, in the Hudson Valley and the Catskills, where Representative Chris Gibson, a Republican, is retiring. A Time Warner Cable News/Siena College poll showed that the Republican candidate, John Faso, a former assemblyman who once ran for governor, and the Democrat, Zephyr Teachout, a law professor, are in a statistical tie.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Faso has sent mixed messages about his party's nominee. He has simultaneously voiced disagreement with Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , said he supports the Republican ticket, and refused to say whether he will vote for him. ''I'm not voting for \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 ,'' he said in a recent telephone interview when asked if he would vote for Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 ''As a husband and father I was simply outraged and appalled,'' Mr. Faso said about Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's boasts of grabbing women's genitals; he called the remarks ''wholly inappropriate for someone running for public office.''\par \par \uc2 Yet, while he acknowledged that Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's candidacy put him and other Republicans in a bind, Mr. Faso said he did not think it would determine the outcome of his race for Congress.\par \par \uc2 ''The vast majority of voters understand there are different candidates running for different offices, and there probably will be a lot of ticket splitting this year,'' he said, referring to those who vote for a presidential candidate from one party and down-ballot candidates from another.\par \par \uc2 Steven Greenberg, a pollster with the Siena College Research Institute, said many independent voters in New York lean Republican.\par \par \uc2 ''If those voters stay home, that could have a major impact on a congressional race,'' he said. ''Anything can tip the balance.''\par \par \uc2 Elsewhere in New York, attention has focused on several other races that could potentially be in play. In the 24th District, which includes Syracuse, the Republican incumbent, Representative John Katko, appears to have a comfortable lead over Colleen Deacon, a Democrat. But the seat has repeatedly flipped from one party to the other over more than a decade. Mr. Katko, a moderate, distanced himself early on from Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , and this month declared he would not vote for him.\par \par \uc2 In the 21st District, in the state's rural Northern Tier, Representative Elise M. Stefanik, the incumbent Republican, has stuck to her support for Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , despite fierce criticism from Mike Derrick, a Democrat.\par \par \uc2 In both races, although the incumbents are seen to be in relatively good shape, a so-called super PAC that backs Republicans, the Congressional Leadership Fund, in recent days has spent heavily on television advertising on their behalf -- a strong indication of how Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's disastrous October has forced his party to act defensively.\par \par \uc2 On Long Island, Representative Lee Zeldin, a Republican from Suffolk County, drew attention this year when he called President Obama a racist while defending Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  against similar accusations. But Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  received 73 percent of the vote in the Republican primary in that district, and Mr. Zeldin, for the moment, appears relatively secure in holding off Anna Throne-Holst, a Democrat.\par \par \uc2 But in more liberal Nassau County, in the Third District, where Democrats outnumber Republicans among registered voters, the story is different in the race for the seat that will be left vacant by the retiring incumbent Democrat, Representative Steve Israel. Analysts said Tom Suozzi, a Democrat, will quite likely be aided by anti-\uc2 Trump\uc2  suburban voters in his race against State Senator Jack M. Martins, a Republican.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's impact is also being watched on races for the New York State Senate, which is narrowly controlled by Republicans. There are about 10 Senate races across the state that observers believe could tilt either way.\par \par \uc2 ''We have some tremendous tailwinds bolstering our cause, due to the national dynamic,'' said State Senator Michael Gianaris of Queens, who leads political operations for Democrats seeking to claim a Senate majority.\par \par \uc2 In particular, Democrats sense an opening in the race for the Nassau County seat being vacated by Mr. Martins, as well as other seats on Long Island and in the Hudson Valley, where there are plenty of the moderate suburban voters most likely to be turned off by Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Scott Reif, a spokesman for the Senate Republicans, said State Senator John J. Flanagan, the current majority leader, ''has made clear that \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2 's recent comments are offensive and intolerable, and do not represent his values or those of the men and women of the Senate Republican Conference.''\par \par \uc2 John Faso, center, a Republican running for Congress in New York's 19th District, stumping in the Hudson Valley last month.

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 After \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2  deemed ''Saturday Night Live'' a ''hit job'' last week, the show wasted no time in skewering his latest debate performance against \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 . The opening sketch again featured \uc2 Alec Baldwin\uc2  as Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  and Kate McKinnon as Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , this time with Tom Hanks as the moderator Chris Wallace, and covered Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's inconsistent foreign policy and inflammatory catchphrases.\par \par \uc2 The sketch begins with Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  promising to be calm and collected before erupting into a brasher persona: calling the Mexican president ''Mr. Guacamole,'' blurting out ''bad hombre'' and ''nasty woman,'' and stumbling through an incoherent description of the situation in the Middle East.\par \par \uc2 [Video: \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  vs. \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  Third Debate Cold Open - SNL Watch on \uc2 YouTube\uc2 .]\par \par \uc2 In the sketch, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  refuses to accept the results of the \uc2 election\uc2  and accuses the media of rigging it, ''by taking all of the things I say and all of the things I do and putting them on TV.'' Mr. Baldwin also poked fun at his own brother Stephen, who is a \uc2 Trump\uc2  supporter.\par \par \uc2 Ms. McKinnon, meanwhile, took a triumphant tone as Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , wriggling out of a question involving \uc2 WikiLeaks\uc2  and gleefully reciting her r\u233\'00\'E9sum\u233\'00\'E9 from the last 30 years. As she pivoted toward the electorate (''Who do you trust to be your president: the Republican, or \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2 ?''), Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  pivoted toward the day after \uc2 Election\uc2  Day: ''On Nov. 9, make sure to check out \uc2 Trump\uc2  TV -- you're going to hate it.''\par \par \uc2 Later in the show, Mr. Hanks portrayed a \uc2 Trump\uc2  supporter who surprisingly finds common ground with attendees on ''Black Jeopardy,'' a recurring ''S.N.L.'' skit.\par \par \uc2 [Video: Black Jeopardy with Tom Hanks - SNL Watch on \uc2 YouTube\uc2 .]\par \par \uc2 Document NYTF000020161024ecao0005u\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 National Desk; SECTA\par \b \uc2 Clash of 2 Lives at \uc2 Trump\uc2  Rally Reveals Layers of Nation's Divide\b0\par\par\uc2 By FARAH STOCKMAN \par \uc2 2,536 \uc2 words\par \uc2 24 October 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 1\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 SAN JOSE, Calif. -- It was a fleeting confrontation between two strangers that might have otherwise been forgotten.\par \par \uc2 But the tussle over a \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2  campaign sign after a June rally in San Jose, Calif., has already sent one man, Anthony McBride, to jail for six days, and left another, Steven Tong, lamenting the loss of civility in our democracy.\par \par \uc2 The rally where these two lives collided by happenstance erupted into one of the most violent episodes of this contentious presidential \uc2 election\uc2 . Video footage of protesters punching, egging and tackling \uc2 Trump\uc2  supporters went viral, sparking outrage among Republicans and soul-searching among Democrats.\par \par \uc2 Today, the clashes between ordinary people like Mr. McBride and Mr. Tong are playing out in the California courts, in a series of criminal prosecutions brought about as Republican officials accused a city led by Democrats of failing to protect \uc2 Trump\uc2  supporters at the rally.\par \par \uc2 The San Jose rally and its aftermath may be the most powerful illustrations of the dangerous polarization that has gripped the country during the 2016 \uc2 election\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 But a closer look at Mr. Tong, one of rally's 24 victims, and Mr. McBride, one of 22 people charged with crimes after the event, suggests that there is much that the two men share. The economic struggles and personal dreams that guided them that day are not so different, after all.\par \par \uc2 On June 2, Mr. Tong woke up in his parents' house, where he has lived for the past three years, ever since he found himself unable to afford a place of his own.\par \par \uc2 He is 46, an age he does not like saying out loud because it reminds him how far he is from where he had hoped to be. He had dreamed of becoming a product designer and starting his own company. But art school was too expensive and he left after a year.\par \par \uc2 ''Companies like \uc2 Facebook\uc2  and these so-called social networking companies here in Silicon Valley became the economy,'' he said.\par \par \uc2 ''If your occupation is in anything other than that,'' he added, ''there are not a whole lot of jobs.''\par \par \uc2 Mr. Tong's faith in the American Dream has been shaken. But that day, he had a ticket to see Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  speak about making America great again. Despite the sweltering heat, Mr. Tong parked in the garage at the San Jose Convention Center and walked a few blocks to the rally.\par \par \uc2 That same morning, Anthony McBride, who is anti-\uc2 Trump\uc2 , woke up in his friend's mother's apartment, where he has lived for the past three years, ever since he found himself unable to afford a place of his own.\par \par \uc2 He is 21, too young to carry the stain of life's disappointments. He dreams of being a fashion designer and starting his own company. But art school is too expensive. He works two jobs -- at a car dealership and a clothing store -- to save for it.\par \par \uc2 He also designs shirts that read ''BE YRSLF.''\par \par \uc2 He hopes they will inspire ''a movement where people are just being themselves and are not following trends or what society says they have to be,'' he said.\par \par \uc2 Mr. McBride's faith in the American Dream remains intact, but it is marred by the bigotry that he sees as a product of Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's campaign. On the morning of the rally, Mr. McBride put on a ''BE YRSLF'' T-shirt and boarded the light rail to the convention center, eager to see for himself what a \uc2 Trump\uc2  event was really like.\par \par \uc2 Steven Tong\par \par \uc2 ''It was hot that day,'' Mr. Tong recalled. ''I was still debating whether or not I wanted to go, and I just kind of thought, 'Oh, I got to show my support.'''\par \par \uc2 In the convention hall, Mr. Tong delighted in the diverse makeup of the crowd.\par \par \uc2 ''I was really surprised,'' he said. A rally he had attended earlier in the spring in Southern California, he said, ''was mostly Caucasian and middle-aged.'' But in San Jose, a city that is about 30 percent Asian and 30 percent Hispanic, more minorities turned out.\par \par \uc2 Outside the hall, beyond the police barricades, protesters waved signs demanding socialism. Young men handed out the Revolutionary Communist Party's newspaper.\par \par \uc2 Like many Asians in San Jose, Mr. Tong was born in Vietnam. He was 4 when Communists captured Saigon.\par \par \uc2 His family had three strikes against it: His father had worked with the United States military. His grandfather had an import-export business. And they hailed from China, a country that once colonized Vietnam. Officials forced Mr. Tong's family to move to a remote hut with a dirt floor.\par \par \uc2 ''The Communist philosophy was, 'If you are a teacher, a professor, an intellectual, wealthy, then we are going to make you suffer,''' Mr. Tong said.\par \par \uc2 When he was 9, his family made it to California. Like others who had fled Vietnam, they embraced the Republican Party's strong anticommunism stance.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Tong considers himself a moderate. During the booming 1990s, he once cast a ballot for \uc2 Bill \uc2 Clinton\uc2 . He says he does not agree with Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's remarks about immigrants and Mexicans.\par \par \uc2 Still, Mr. Tong feels anxious about the racial unrest flaring up across the country. Like many \uc2 Trump\uc2  supporters, he blames President Obama.\par \par \uc2 ''He seems more polarizing,'' Mr. Tong said of Mr. Obama. ''He stirs people up.''\par \par \uc2 Mr. Tong once felt boundless optimism about the United States. His parents, who worked entry-level jobs in electronics, had been able to buy a three-bedroom home in a well-off San Jose suburb. But now Mr. Tong cannot afford to rent -- let alone buy -- a home of his own. He was drawn to the June rally by Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's promise to make America as strong as it was when Mr. Tong arrived.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  took the stage and declared, ''We have a country that's not working anymore.''\par \par \uc2 ''We have a chance to be greater than ever before,'' he said.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Tong left the rally clutching a sign: ''The silent majority stands with \uc2 Trump\uc2 .''\par \par \uc2 He meandered back to his car, chatting with a teenager from Mexico who held a sign opposing \uc2 Trump\uc2 . They joked about trading signs. Nothing seemed threatening or out of the ordinary. But when Mr. Tong reached the parking garage, he witnessed something shocking: protesters trying to steal \uc2 Trump\uc2  hats off the heads of an older Hispanic couple.\par \par \uc2 ''I said, 'Come on, guys,''' Mr. Tong recalled. ''That's when the crowd started turning on me. Everything went out of control really quickly.''\par \par \uc2 He added: ''At that moment, I felt the whole crowd surrounding me. You're fearing for your life.''\par \par \uc2 Mr. Tong ran into the garage. He noticed a tall black man coming behind him.\par \par \uc2 Anthony McBride\par \par \uc2 ''It was a Tuesday, my day off,'' Mr. McBride recalled. ''I slept in, watched some TV.''\par \par \uc2 While checking \uc2 Twitter\uc2 , he noticed that Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  was coming to town.\par \par \uc2 Mr. McBride hoped to get into the rally ''to go experience what he says for myself,'' he said. But a wall of police officers blocked the entrance. So he drifted to the ''free speech'' area, where protesters -- including some friends from Oak Grove, where he had gone to high school -- gathered. Mr. McBride had fond memories of Oak Grove, even though he was asked to leave it.\par \par \uc2 In his senior year, he had attended a basketball game against a suburban school from a more affluent community. Rival fans chanted that Oak Grove students were on welfare. Mr. McBride said he and his friends responded with their own chant, ''We drive sober'' -- a painful reference to a drunken-driving death the rival school had recently suffered. Afterward, Mr. McBride said, school authorities asked him to finish his credits with independent study. (The school's principal declined to comment.)\par \par \uc2 At the time, Mr. McBride lived with his aunt, who told him he had to be in school to stay with her. He ended up on the couch in the apartment of his best friend's mother. Three years later, he is still there.\par \par \uc2 Mr. McBride considers himself a moderate. He opposes amnesty for undocumented immigrants. He believes that the entrepreneurial spirit should be rewarded.\par \par \uc2 But it is racism -- not government regulation of the economy -- that worries him. The son of an African-American father and an Irish mother he has not seen since he was 4, Mr. McBride blames the recent racial unrest on injustice, not Democratic politicians.\par \par \uc2 ''People are just frustrated,'' he said. ''With police brutality. With feeling not equal to white people.''\par \par \uc2 To Mr. McBride's generation, the spate of high-profile police killings of black people shows the limits of politics and the need for activism. Protests -- not the \uc2 election\uc2  of a black president -- have brought a modicum of justice.\par \par \uc2 The Encounter\par \par \uc2 Joining the gathering crowd outside the convention center, Mr. McBride felt he had justice on his side.\par \par \uc2 At first, he said, it felt like a carnival outside the arena. People danced to Mexican music. Street vendors sold watermelon.\par \par \uc2 But then the rally inside ended. \uc2 Trump\uc2  supporters poured out. Protesters chanted obscenities at them. They hurled insults back.\par \par \uc2 A blonde woman named Rachel Casey, who was wearing a \uc2 Trump\uc2  shirt, filmed herself sticking her middle finger up at the crowd. Protesters traded insults with her as she drifted past the police barricades to the Marriott Hotel next door. Protesters surrounded her in the doorway.\par \par \uc2 Then someone threw a piece of watermelon.\par \par \uc2 ''I was in the front, just clapping,'' Mr. McBride said. ''Someone in the back started throwing eggs. One of them hit me. I was like, 'Wow, who brought eggs?'''\par \par \uc2 A hotel security guard opened the door and Ms. Casey slipped inside. The crowd marched on. A black female protester burning an American flag got into a shoving match with a white female \uc2 Trump\uc2  supporter. A white teenager got scared and started running. A black teenager tackled him. A first-generation Mexican who opposes Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  punched in the nose a third-generation Mexican who supports the candidate.\par \par \uc2 The police later traced the most violent run-ins to ''local gangsters'' with long criminal records, according to Sgt. Brian Anderson, who headed the San Jose police team that pored over thousands of hours of videos from the rally.\par \par \uc2 Some Oak Grove High School students were also charged. ''Several of them were good students and athletes, but they decided to forget their upbringing,'' Sergeant Anderson said.\par \par \uc2 Mr. McBride might have fit into in that category. He was an athlete, but he said his father, who works at a warehouse, allowed him to play sports only if he got good grades.\par \par \uc2 But Mr. McBride admits that he got angry that day at the rally. He says \uc2 Trump\uc2  supporters mistook him for Mexican and shouted insults at him.\par \par \uc2 ''I heard, 'Go back to your country, wetback,''' he said. He started taking every \uc2 Trump\uc2  sign he saw and ripping it in half.\par \par \uc2 He followed a wave of protesters into a parking garage. That's where he spotted an Asian man with a \uc2 Trump\uc2  sign.\par \par \uc2 ''I was kind of disappointed in him,'' Mr. McBride recalled. ''He's a minority, and I didn't see why he's supporting \uc2 Trump\uc2 .''\par \par \uc2 Mr. McBride snatched Mr. Tong's sign. Mr. Tong grabbed it back. For a split second, they held it together, in a tug of war. Mr. McBride could see the fear in Mr. Tong's eyes.\par \par \uc2 Months later, Mr. Tong looked back at the encounter and wondered about Mr. McBride. Was he a college student?\par \par \uc2 ''He didn't seem like a gangster,'' Mr. Tong recalled. ''There are protesters who are just upset, and I think if I was in their position, I'd be upset, too. But no protester -- no matter how angry they are -- can break things and harass people.''\par \par \uc2 Maybe because of the stress of what happened to him at the rally, Mr. Tong dreams of escaping on \uc2 Election\uc2  Day. He thinks about camping in Death Valley on Nov. 8 just so he can get away from the news. But sometimes he has the opposite desire. He wants to visit an old friend -- a black man he met in a long-ago photography class -- so they can have political debates about Mr. Obama that he keeps bottled up inside.\par \par \uc2 Meanwhile, Mr. McBride thinks back on that moment and regrets being the source of Mr. Tong's fear.\par \par \uc2 ''I'd probably have been afraid, too,'' Mr. McBride said. ''I didn't agree with any of the fighting.''\par \par \uc2 But two weeks after the rally, police officers showed up at Mr. McBride's job at the mall and asked him to answer some questions. Mr. McBride, who has no criminal record, cooperated. He did not ask for a lawyer. ''I wasn't scared because I didn't do anything,'' he said.\par \par \uc2 He said he told them everything he could remember. Afterward, he expected to be allowed to go home. Instead, they handcuffed him and took him to jail, where he remained for six days, accused of vandalism, battery and the attempted theft of Mr. Tong's sign.\par \par \uc2 On a recent Wednesday, Mr. McBride sat in court on a row of benches filled with black and Hispanic men, nearly all of them represented by a single public defender.\par \par \uc2 ''McBride? You're our \uc2 Trump\uc2  guy, right?'' she asked.\par \par \uc2 She explained that because of what he had told the police about the confrontation outside the rally, prosecutors were adding a new charge: the false imprisonment of Ms. Casey, who had been egged.\par \par \uc2 ''We'll try to get it down to 'disturbing the peace,''' she said. ''I don't know if we're going to get there, but that's our goal.''\par \par \uc2 Now Mr. McBride, who cannot afford a lawyer, is not sure if he should plead guilty to a crime he doesn't feel he committed, or fight the charges. He thinks about that moment when he grabbed Mr. Tong's sign, and about what made him let it go.\par \par \uc2 ''I realized it was stupid,'' he recalled. ''If it was on a different street, at a different time, I probably would have just talked to him about why he was supporting \uc2 Trump\uc2 . But it was not a regular day.''\par \par \uc2 Find out what you need to know about the 2016 presidential race today, and get politics news updates via \uc2 Facebook\uc2 , \uc2 Twitter\uc2  and the First Draft newsletter.\par \par \uc2 Steven Tong, with a \uc2 Trump\uc2  campaign sign, and Anthony McBride, directly behind him, after a campaign event in June in San Jose, Calif.

\par\par \uc2 MEDIATOR\par \uc2 Business/Financial Desk; SECTB\par \b \uc2 A Reality TV Campaign Gets a Dose of Reality\b0\par\par\uc2 By JIM RUTENBERG \par \uc2 1,426 \uc2 words\par \uc2 24 October 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 1\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 You sure have to hand it to the Russians.\par \par \uc2 They understand the power of free-flowing information, how it can upend government and politics.\par \par \uc2 It's why they don't let information flow too freely in their own country. And it's why, if United States intelligence assessments are correct, they have worked so hard to send it roaring through ours.\par \par \uc2 There is a certain kind of brilliance to the way the Russians are said to have hacked the email accounts of senior Democratic officials and gifted the contents to their BFFs at \uc2 WikiLeaks\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 The Russians seem to be using the United States' free press -- a great symbol of our democracy -- against it while setting up an impossible choice for American newsrooms: Run with the stolen and in many cases unverified correspondence and potentially assist an audacious Russian attempt to disrupt a presidential \uc2 election\uc2 , or decline to print it and betray their mission to combat the great political fog machine.\par \par \uc2 Declining to cover the emails would play into accusations that the media is censoring news that would be helpful to \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2 . In that case, the Russians get a nice consolation prize: fodder for their disingenuous argument that if any system is ''rigged,'' it's the United States', so judge not lest you be judged. Khrushchev would be proud.\par \par \uc2 But the whole thing seems to be backfiring. In this, the year of the leak, the hackers are contributing to a phenomenon -- raw transparency -- that should make democracy stronger.\par \par \uc2 Taken together, this year's big breaches -- nefarious and otherwise -- are bringing a dose of reality to this reality television campaign, exposing what the candidates or their aides say and do when they think no one is looking.\par \par \uc2 And they have pulled back the curtain on the political-celebrity mythmaking that the American media too often abets.\par \par \uc2 Exhibit A is a 2006 People magazine article about Donald and Melania \uc2 Trump\uc2 . ''During their first year of marriage, Donald and Melania \uc2 Trump\uc2  reveled in being a twosome,'' People said as it took note of their first anniversary and Melania's pregnancy.\par \par \uc2 Depends on your definition of ''revel.''\par \par \uc2 As we know, a reporter on the piece, Natasha Stoynoff, now claims that Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  forced his tongue down her throat and proposed having an affair -- while she was reporting on the Trumps' love story. And we know about her allegations, which Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  denies, only because of the leaked ''Access Hollywood'' tape where he boasted about kissing women uninvited and grabbing their privates.\par \par \uc2 Ms. Stoynoff said that she went ahead with the original piece about the \uc2 Trump\uc2  marriage in People because she was ashamed and feared retaliation.\par \par \uc2 Jess Cagle, People's editor in chief, told me that if higher-ups had known the truth at the time, the article would have been spiked or ''been about his abusive behavior toward women rather than his alleged domestic bliss.''\par \par \uc2 The important message, he said, was that ''if a staffer is abused in any way'' he or she will have ''the full support of senior management.'' And presumably times have changed enough that a writer would not feel obliged to write an article at odds with his or her own experience.\par \par \uc2 But the entertainment press is not alone in occasionally conveying false or incomplete narratives. The political press can do it too, if often led by the invisible hands of operatives whose job it is to stage-manage reality.\par \par \uc2 The latest warning sign comes from a tricky source, the conservative activist-journalist James O'Keefe and his Project Veritas Action, which specializes in goading opponents into discussing illegal or unethical schemes while secretly recording them.\par \par \uc2 In a video Mr. O'Keefe released last week, a Democratic operative, Scott Foval, brags about sending troublemakers to Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's rallies, to provoke \uc2 Trump\uc2  supporters into attacking them.\par \par \uc2 Mr. O'Keefe has a history of selectively editing his videos to create misleading or false impressions. As The \uc2 New York Times\uc2  and The \uc2 Washington Post\uc2  have noted, it is unclear whether Mr. Foval accomplished what he boasted about. But the party strategist Mr. Foval was working for, Robert Creamer, fired him and then ceased his own work for the \uc2 Democratic National Committee\uc2 . (He disputed Mr. Foval's claims of inciting violence.)\par \par \uc2 Mr. Foval's words alone should be enough to remind reporters that there are people who are paid to distort the picture they present. If he did succeed in his plans, and drew headlines that depicted Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's supporters as attacking protesters without provocation, he got one over on the news media as much as he did on Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Which brings me back to the Russians. Is that what they are doing, playing the media for their own purposes?\par \par \uc2 On Thursday, a private internet security firm, \uc2 Dell SecureWorks\uc2 , said the Russian hackers that the United States officially blamed for breaking into Democratic Party accounts over the summer were involved in the latest \uc2 WikiLeaks\uc2  email dump, which came from the account of a senior \uc2 Clinton\uc2  adviser, \uc2 John Podesta\uc2 . The \uc2 WikiLeaks\uc2  founder, Julian Assange, has declined to disclose the source of the emails.\par \par \uc2 Saying the Russians have ''weaponized'' \uc2 WikiLeaks\uc2 , the \uc2 Clinton\uc2  campaign will not readily verify the authenticity of the emails, though it has not issued blanket denials, either. Brian Fallon, the campaign spokesman, told me he had been warning reporters against taking the emails at face value and reminding them not to lose sight of their provenance.\par \par \uc2 Then there is the fact that they are from Mr. Podesta's private account.\par \par \uc2 All of it has made reporting on the emails incredibly fraught. Even Glenn Greenwald of The Intercept, who helped bring to light Edward J. Snowden's leaks, has expressed qualms about poring over personal emails (along with skepticism of Russia's suspected role in stealing them).\par \par \uc2 ''Even people who are in powerful positions and wield influence continue to retain the right to privacy, and there should never be any publishing of personal matters or things that aren't directly in the public interest,'' he said in a discussion about the emails with the author Naomi Klein.\par \par \uc2 But Mr. Greenwald said there was too much of a public interest at stake to ignore emails that ''shed light on the person highly likely to be the next president of the United States.''\par \par \uc2 Most of the mainstream news media has taken the same position.\par \par \uc2 As \uc2 Susan Glasser\uc2 , the Politico editor, told me, it's not every day that you get a ''real-time look'' at the decision-making of a major presidential campaign.\par \par \uc2 And it's not as if there is much of a choice, anyway, she said, given that ''we can't unknow things that are in the public space.''\par \par \uc2 That is, the emails are out there. It is the job of the mainstream press to use reporting to determine their validity and significance, and put their contents in their proper context. That's especially important when misleading, partisan interpretations can bounce around the internet at the speed of \uc2 Twitter\uc2 , which serves Russia most of all.\par \par \uc2 The emails have shown cynical approaches by \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  and her team to fund-raising; a penchant for secrecy; a coziness with reporters that is too often the case with both parties in Washington; and a calculated approach to environmental issues, free trade and banking that is already causing trouble on her left flank, as \uc2 Politico\uc2  reported.\par \par \uc2 They have not brought a major scandal to the surface, at least not yet, and even won praise from some supporters like The Post's editorial page, which said they showed Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's ''sound policy instincts.'' They've certainly not blown up the system, as might happen in a more closed, undemocratic form of government.\par \par \uc2 If repressive foreign governments want to make a regular thing of hacking into United States leaders' email to undermine the country, and domestic politicians like Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  want to keep embracing that kind of ''help,'' then the news media may have to rethink how to handle it.\par \par \uc2 But so far, the hacks have only proved that the United States system knows how to process reality and can handle the truth, which should encourage our leaders to offer more of it.\par \par \uc2 So for that much, I guess, thanks, \uc2 Vladimir Putin\uc2 . Now, ready to share your emails?\par \par \uc2 Julian Assange, who has sought asylum at the Ecuadorean Embassy in London, has not revealed the source of Democratic emails.

\par\par \uc2 Business/Financial Desk; SECTB\par \b \uc2 Now at GQ, Keith Olbermann Takes His Outrage Online\b0\par\par\uc2 By RICHARD SANDOMIR \par \uc2 1,236 \uc2 words\par \uc2 24 October 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 1\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Keith Olbermann knows the question before it is asked: How, after a career spent anchoring news and sports shows on \uc2 ESPN\uc2 , MSNBC, \uc2 NBC\uc2  and Fox, has he come to be delivering anti-Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2  commentaries on GQ magazine's website?\par \par \uc2 He was a big, talented, peripatetic TV star, who, at times, was his own worst enemy, too often clashing with management. And now he's on a short-term assignment for GQ.com that will end with the \uc2 election\uc2 , with no guarantees afterward.\par \par \uc2 Still, he says he is happy, even liberated. He can say what he pleases and is performing in an evolving online environment that reminds him of being at \uc2 CNN\uc2  in its early days, and \uc2 ESPN\uc2  in its early middle period. So what if he has left behind the trappings, and production values, of prime-time TV?\par \par \uc2 ''This is it,'' he said, with a triumphal tone in his baritone during a recent interview. ''This is where it's going. There will be a garage-band quality to news, particularly video news, in the years to come, and I think it'll be limitless. Maybe there will be a NewsFlix in the future, with 37 options -- with Olbermann's commentaries and a three-minute Al Roker forecast.''\par \par \uc2 ''If this looks like a downward spiral,'' he continued, ''I would point out that I don't need the money. I'm doing this for charity -- for dogs groups and veterans groups. I'm doing this for the rides downtown.''\par \par \uc2 He was speaking in a spacious studio on the 24th floor of 1 World Trade Center, looking like a bank executive in his \uc2 Brooks Brothers\uc2  ensemble, with silver hair and black-framed glasses. The scripts to the three essays he was going to record for his series, ''The Closer'' -- each a fiery burst of outrage about Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's unfitness for the presidency -- lay on a table before him.\par \par \uc2 ''Were it the choice,'' he said near the end of one of them, ''I would sooner and happily vote for a third term of George W. Bush than five minutes of President \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2 .''\par \par \uc2 At a certain point, a return to political commentary in any medium looked improbable for Mr. Olbermann.\par \par \uc2 He hosted ''Countdown'' on MSNBC through the re-\uc2 election\uc2  of George W. Bush in 2004 and the \uc2 election\uc2  of \uc2 Barack Obama\uc2  in 2008. But he left unhappily in 2011. He hooked up with Current TV, Al Gore's short-lived cable venture. That relationship ended in vitriol and lawsuits, but a legal settlement reportedly left Mr. Olbermann quite wealthy.\par \par \uc2 He returned to sports and \uc2 ESPN\uc2  in 2013 with a studio show, ''Olbermann,'' on ESPN2 that ultimately could not overcome various factors, including shifting time slots and modest viewership.\par \par \uc2 But the political climate that fed Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's rise riveted and dismayed Mr. Olbermann. His animus toward Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  since the beginning of his presidential run led Mr. Olbermann to sell his condominium apartment at the \uc2 Trump\uc2  Palace in Manhattan this summer. (Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  responded by releasing a statement that said in part, ''Keith is a failed broadcaster and the people in the building couldn't stand him.'')\par \par \uc2 His interest piqued, Mr. Olbermann thought of a comeback, but talks that focused on returning to MSNBC and \uc2 CNN\uc2  (or its sibling network, HLN) ultimately went nowhere.\par \par \uc2 During the summer, a friend of Mr. Olbermann's who writes for GQ heard that the magazine wanted to talk to him about creating online commentaries for its website, whose most popular feature explores extremely expensive luxury goods with the rapper 2 Chainz. Mr. Olbermann and the magazine came to a quick agreement in August.\par \par \uc2 ''We wanted to add to our political and \uc2 election\uc2  coverage, and that dovetailed with Keith's desire to get back into the game,'' said Jim Nelson, editor in chief of GQ. ''We felt that no one was meeting \uc2 Trump\uc2  at the temperature level that was needed. And I missed Keith's rage. We miss Jon Stewart. And we only get weekly doses of Samantha Bee and John Oliver. That's not enough.''\par \par \uc2 A decade ago, GQ lauded Mr. Olbermann in an article for producing ''the most electric, intelligent and eviscerating news commentary on television,'' and posed him in a raincoat as Howard Beale, the unhinged, mad-as-hell newsman from ''Network.''\par \par \uc2 So far, Mr. Nelson is pleased that the magazine is swimming in Mr. Olbermann's indignation. His more than 20 videos have attracted about 25 million views on GQ.com, \uc2 YouTube\uc2 , \uc2 Twitter\uc2  and \uc2 Facebook\uc2 , and sites like \uc2 Yahoo\uc2  and Huffington Post, according to internal measurements.\par \par \uc2 Though measuring online views is an imprecise practice -- and the definition of what actually constitutes a view varies from platform to platform -- Mr. Olbermann sees those numbers as vindication of his new embrace of the online format.\par \par \uc2 The first episode, called ''176 Shocking Things \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  Has Done This \uc2 Election\uc2 ,'' has been viewed more than 800,000 times on \uc2 YouTube\uc2 . ''That's from a dead stop,'' he said. ''No promotion. Basically me tweeting every few hours and word of mouth.''\par \par \uc2 But not all responses have been positive. A recent article in Slate called the commentaries ''a context-less, free-floating slice of sound and anguish'' and ''the most embarrassing thing humanity has ever produced.'' It said Mr. Olbermann had ''the superior tone of some disappointed national dad.''\par \par \uc2 Jamie Horowitz, who produced Mr. Olbermann's show at ESPN2 and is now president of Fox Sports national networks, looks at the commentaries on GQ.com as less of a surprising career shift than a simple change in where content is available.\par \par \uc2 ''My belief is that content has to be platform-agnostic,'' he said. ''You can create quite compelling content on a variety of different platforms. That's where we're headed.''\par \par \uc2 Mr. Olbermann goes into GQ's offices at least twice a week to tape ''The Closer.'' A small group of GQ staff members work on the series. A fashion editor, Jon Tietz, fusses over his tie and shirt collar. Geoffrey Gagnon, an articles editor, goes over the scripts. Instead of an elaborate anchor desk, Mr. Olbermann sits at a plain white table. A blue blanket is beneath his feet to muffle sound. A blue and red backdrop hangs behind him.\par \par \uc2 His commentary style is feverish, erudite and emotional -- unchanged since his ''Special Comment'' segments on MSNBC.\par \par \uc2 In a comment posted after Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  said at last Wednesday's debate that he might not accept the results of next month's \uc2 election\uc2 , Mr. Olbermann pointedly addressed several Republican leaders, including Paul D. Ryan, the House speaker, and Mitch McConnell, the Senate majority leader.\par \par \uc2 ''Compel him to withdraw. Now,'' he said. ''Litigate against him. Find enough doctors and have him declared psychiatrically incompetent. At minimum, cut off his funding completely and denounce him in the strongest possible terms. Because this nightmare, this fascist, this \uc2 Trump\uc2 , is now your responsibility.''\par \par \uc2 The same Mr. Olbermann. Just in a very different venue.\par \par \uc2 Keith Olbermann at the Cond\u233\'00\'E9 Nast studio in New York where he is making videos for GQ magazine.

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  and \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2  are in the final sprint of spending on television advertising, which has been vastly lower than in previous elections.\par \par \uc2 Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's advertising strategy has been consistent over the course of the general \uc2 election\uc2 , focusing primarily on Florida, Ohio and Pennsylvania. As she extends her lad in the polls, she may be looking to expand the electoral map by booking television advertising in Arizona and Texas.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  is also making an offensive paly in the final weeks. He has $2 million of advertising booked in Virginia, a state he briefly focused on at the start o September. Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  has not run ads in Virginia for moths, and she is ahead in the polls there by nine points.\par \par \uc2 This \uc2 election\uc2  year has been an interesting anomaly. Outside groups have spent far less on the presidential \uc2 election\uc2  this year than they did in 2012. Travis Ridout, a professor at Washington State University, noted that swing states were blanked in ads four years ago. ''The groups that were investing the millions upon millions in ads in highly saturated media markets just weren't happy with the returns they were getting,'' he said.\par \par \uc2 Steve Passwaiter, the general manager of the Campaign Media Analysis Group at Kantar Media, attributed some of the decline to Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's and Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's high name recognition and decades in public life. Advertising, he said, would be much more important for candidates trying to sell themselves to voters for the first time.\par \par \uc2 Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's campaign has booked slightly more advertising than Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's in the final weeks of the \uc2 election\uc2 . Those figures may rise as the campaigns make their final allocations.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Passwaiter was skeptical that the final burst of spending would have a large effect. ''I don't know how many people are remaining to be persuaded and are open to the message,'' he said.\par \par \uc2 GRAPHIC (Source: Kantar Media's Campaign Media Analysis Group.

BLOW \par \uc2 934 \uc2 words\par \uc2 24 October 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 21\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 President Obama is fond of saying that \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  is the most qualified person to ever seek the presidency. And, if current polls are correct and prove resilient, she will be one of the most qualified people to be elected and ascend to that office.\par \par \uc2 But one of the great ironies of this \uc2 election\uc2  is that America's first female president may be viewed by many as the country's most invalid president, hanging under the specter of suspicion, mistrust and illegitimacy.\par \par \uc2 This is partly because her opponents all along the way have complained that the system -- from the media to the electoral apparatus -- was ''rigged'' and unfairly tilted in her favor, and it's partly because of unflattering bits of information that have come to light from an illegal hack.\par \par \uc2 During the primaries, Bernie Sanders (who now supports \uc2 Clinton\uc2 ) made very clear that he thought that both the media and the Democratic Party itself had not been fair to him. As he put it, ''We knew we were taking on the establishment.''\par \par \uc2 This became a motif of his revolution, and a force corrosive to voters' confidence in the primary process. A March Pew report found a striking decline in Democrats' trust in their nominating process:\par \par \uc2 ''Democrats and Republicans differ on whether the presidential primaries are a good way of determining the best-qualified nominees. Currently, 42 percent of Republican voters have a positive view of the primary process, compared with 30 percent of Democrats. The share of Democrats expressing a positive view of the primary process has declined 22 percentage points,'' from 52 percent in February 2008. ''Republicans' views are little different than in 2000 or 2008.''\par \par \uc2 In early May, Sanders said at a rally:\par \par \uc2 ''When we talk about a rigged system, it's also important to understand how the Democratic Convention works. We have won, at this point, 45 percent of pledged delegates, but we have only earned 7 percent of superdelegates.''\par \par \uc2 In late May, Sanders reversed course on the system being ''rigged'' on ''Face the Nation,'' saying:\par \par \uc2 ''What has upset me, and what I think is -- I wouldn't use the word rigged, because we knew what the words were -- but what is really dumb is that you have closed primaries, like in New York State, where three million people who are Democrats or Republicans could not participate, where you have a situation where over 400 superdelegates came on board \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's campaign before anybody else was in the race, eight months before the first vote was cast.\par \par \uc2 Blogs like Vox and FiveThirtyEight tried to debunk the rigging claims, saying essentially that while some rules worked against Sanders, others worked in his favor, and in the end he simply lost because he got fewer votes. But still, the ''rigged'' idea stuck.\par \par \uc2 This idea was buttressed by \uc2 WikiLeaks\uc2 ' release of hacked emails that showed that some in the \uc2 Democratic National Committee\uc2  displayed an open disdain for Sanders and, as The \uc2 New York Times\uc2  reported, ''showed party officials conspiring to sabotage'' his campaign.\par \par \uc2 Whereas the foundation of Sanders's objections were at least based on real issues, even though many were by no means new to this cycle, \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2 's sermonizing about rigging is constructed of wild conspiracy and conjecture.\par \par \uc2 Trump\uc2  has been on a tear for weeks about the general \uc2 election\uc2  being ''rigged,'' and apparently that message is sinking in among a large portion of his supporters, just as it sank in among a large portion of Democratic primary voters.\par \par \uc2 An NBC/\uc2 SurveyMonkey\uc2  poll released Friday found that 45 percent of Republicans definitely wouldn't or were unlikely to accept the result of the \uc2 election\uc2  if their candidate lost, compared to 30 percent of Independents and 16 percent of Democrats who felt the same.\par \par \uc2 At this point, it's not even clear if \uc2 Trump\uc2  would graciously concede if he lost. Indeed, grace may be beyond his grasp.\par \par \uc2 And while there are signs that \uc2 Clinton\uc2  is narrowing the enthusiasm gap with \uc2 Trump\uc2 , my sense is that \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's current success is as much a repudiation of \uc2 Trump\uc2 's abhorrence as it is an embrace of \uc2 Clinton\uc2 . It feels to me more like exhaustion than exhilaration.\par \par \uc2 We could be on the verge of something historic. So, why does it feel so much like acquiescence? Why aren't more people rushing to the polls to vote for this immensely qualified women rather than rushing to vote against this woefully unqualified man? One of the reasons is that her male opponents have successfully cast the race she may win as rigged.\par \par \uc2 I think it's fair to say our electoral processes aren't perfect. But they've never been. Nor has any candidate been perfect. So why must those imperfections be nullifying at the very moment that a woman is on the verge of victory? \uc2 Clinton\uc2  is a woman beating men at their own game. Deal with it.\par \par \uc2 Still, this all means that a potential Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  administration could commence under a cloud and against a chill wind. It could be a first, but one met with a frost. Revolutionary acts come at a cost.\par \par \uc2 I invite you to join me on \uc2 Facebook\uc2  and follow me on Twitter (@CharlesMBlow), or email me at chblow@nytimes.com.\par \par \uc2 Follow The \uc2 New York Times\uc2  Opinion section on \uc2 Facebook\uc2  and Twitter (@NYTopinion), and sign up for the Opinion Today newsletter.\par \par \uc2 CHART: Against Acceptance: If your candidate loses, would you accept the result of the \uc2 election\uc2 ?

\par\par \uc2 OP-ED COLUMNIST\par \uc2 Editorial Desk; SECTA\par \b \uc2 It's \uc2 Trump\uc2 's Party\b0\par\par\uc2 By PAUL KRUGMAN \par \uc2 878 \uc2 words\par \uc2 24 October 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 21\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 The presidential campaign is entering its final weeks, and unless the polls are completely off, \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  has very little chance of winning -- only 7 percent, according to the Times's Upshot model. Meanwhile, the candidate continues to say disgusting things, and analysts are asking whether down-ballot Republicans will finally repudiate their party's nominee.\par \par \uc2 The answer should be, who cares? Everyone who endorsed Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  in the past owns him now; it's far too late to get a refund. And voters should realize that voting for any \uc2 Trump\uc2  endorser is, in effect, a vote for Trumpism, whatever happens at the top of the ticket.\par \par \uc2 First of all, nobody who was paying attention can honestly claim to have learned anything new about Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  in the last few weeks. It was obvious from the beginning that he was a ''con artist'' -- so declared \uc2 Marco Rubio\uc2 , who has nonetheless endorsed his candidacy. His racism and sexism were apparent from the beginning of his campaign; his vindictiveness and lack of self-discipline were on full display in his tirades against Judge Gonzalo Curiel and Khizr Khan.\par \par \uc2 So any politicians who try after the \uc2 election\uc2  to distance themselves from the \uc2 Trump\uc2  phenomenon -- or even unendorse in these remaining few days -- have already failed the character test. They knew who he was all along, they knew that this was a man who should never, ever hold any kind of responsible position, let alone become president. Yet they refused to speak out against his candidacy as long as he had a chance of winning -- that is, they supported him when it mattered, and only distanced themselves when it didn't. That's a huge moral failure, and deserves to be remembered as such.\par \par \uc2 Of course, we know why the great majority of Republican politicians supported Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  despite his evident awfulness: They feared retribution from the party's base if they didn't. But that's not an excuse. On the contrary, it's reason to trust these people even less. We already know that they lack any moral backbone, that they will do whatever it takes to guarantee their own political survival.\par \par \uc2 And what this means in practice is that they will remain Trumpists after the \uc2 election\uc2 , even if the Orange One himself vanishes from the scene.\par \par \uc2 After all, what we learned during the Republican primary was that the party's base doesn't care at all about what the party establishment says: Jeb Bush (remember him?), the initial insider choice, got nowhere despite a giant war chest, and Mr. Rubio, who succeeded him as the establishment favorite, did hardly better. Nor does the base care at all about supposed conservative principles like small government.\par \par \uc2 What Republican voters wanted, instead, were candidates who channeled their anger and fear, who demonized nonwhites and played into dark conspiracy theories. (Even establishment candidates did that -- never forget that Mr. Rubio accused President Obama of deliberately hurting America.)\par \par \uc2 Just in case you had any doubts about that political reality, a Bloomberg poll recently asked Republicans whose view better matched their own view of what the party should stand for: \uc2 Paul Ryan\uc2  or \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2 . The answer was Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , by a wide margin.\par \par \uc2 This lesson hasn't been lost on Republican politicians. Even if Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  loses bigly, they'll know that their personal fortunes will depend on maintaining an essentially Trumpist line. Otherwise they will face serious primary challenges and/or be at risk of losing future elections when base voters stay home.\par \par \uc2 So you can ignore all the efforts to portray Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  as a deviation from the G.O.P.'s true path: Trumpism is what the party is all about. Maybe they'll find future standard-bearers with better impulse control and fewer personal skeletons in their closets, but the underlying nastiness is now part of Republican DNA.\par \par \uc2 And the immediate consequences will be very ugly. Assuming that \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  wins, she will face an opposing party that demonizes her and denies her legitimacy no matter how large her margin of victory. It may be hard to think of any way Republicans could be even more obstructionist and destructive than they were during the Obama years, but they'll find a way, believe me.\par \par \uc2 In fact, it's likely to be so bad that America's governability may hang in the balance. A Democratic recapture of the Senate would be a very big deal, but they are unlikely to take the House, thanks to the clustering of their voters. So how will basic business like budgeting get done? Some observers are already speculating about a regime in which the House is effectively run by Democrats in cooperation with a small rump of rational Republicans. Let's hope so -- but it's no way to manage a great nation.\par \par \uc2 Still, it's hard to see an alternative. For the modern G.O.P. is Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's party, with or without the man himself.\par \par \uc2 Read my blog, The Conscience of a Liberal, and follow me on \uc2 Twitter\uc2 , @PaulKrugman.\par \par \uc2 Follow The \uc2 New York Times\uc2  Opinion section on \uc2 Facebook\uc2  and \uc2 Twitter\uc2  (@NYTopinion), and sign up for the Opinion Today newsletter.\par \par \uc2 Document NYTF000020161024ecao0004u\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 Business/Financial Desk; SECTB\par \b \uc2 Megadeals Send Signal of Assurance\b0\par\par\uc2 By DAVID GELLES \par \uc2 1,087 \uc2 words\par \uc2 24 October 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 4\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 By many measures, this should be a moment of great economic uncertainty for the corporate world.\par \par \uc2 The United States \uc2 election\uc2  looms. Interest rates are set to rise soon. Britain plans to leave the \uc2 European Union\uc2 . China's economic growth is slowing. Cyberattacks are on the rise. And Russia is flexing its military muscle in the Middle East.\par \par \uc2 Any one of these factors would usually be enough to give chief executives pause. The men and women who run the world's largest corporations are nothing if not cautious.\par \par \uc2 Yet across industries, there are surprising signs of confidence, with corporate chieftains and directors signaling their belief that the upswing will continue for months or even years to come. Investors are betting on sustained growth. Companies are hiring. And huge mergers and acquisitions are back in fashion.\par \par \uc2 On Saturday night, \uc2 AT&T\uc2  said it planned to acquire \uc2 Time Warner\uc2  for $85.4 billion -- the biggest deal of the year. On Friday, \uc2 British American Tobacco\uc2  offered $47 billion for the portion of \uc2 Reynolds American\uc2  that it does not already own. And this week, the chip maker \uc2 Qualcomm\uc2  is expected to make a $37 billion offer for the rival company \uc2 NXP Semiconductors\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Such megadeals are often postponed during times of political or economic uncertainty. Yet at what feels to many like a tumultuous moment for the global economy, many corporate titans apparently see smooth sailing ahead.\par \par \uc2 The most imminent economic concern may be the outcome of the race for the White House. Though Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2  has positioned himself as a successful businessman, economists have warned of market upheavals if he is elected.\par \par \uc2 But with \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's lead over Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  wide and still growing with less than three weeks until \uc2 Election\uc2  Day, chief executives appear to be betting that the race is all but over.\par \par \uc2 ''Everyone is expecting a \uc2 Clinton\uc2  victory,'' said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics. ''She represents the status quo. They think nothing is going to change, and they're comfortable with that.'''\par \par \uc2 Another major concern among chief executives has been that the \uc2 Federal Reserve\uc2  will soon raise interest rates, making it more expensive for companies to borrow. But after the Fed raised short-term interest rates last December for the first time since the financial crisis, the markets took it in stride. Even now, as the Fed's chairwoman, \uc2 Janet L. Yellen\uc2 , signals that rate increases are coming soon, investors and executives appear unfazed.\par \par \uc2 ''The \uc2 Federal Reserve\uc2  is sending very strong signals that, yes, it is going to normalize interest rates, but very, very slowly,'' Mr. Zandi said. ''That makes deals easier to get done. It's a very sanguine, propitious environment for deals.''\par \par \uc2 Not everyone is benefiting from that confidence in the C-suite. Millions of Americans are feeling left behind, a sentiment that is driving the rising populism that has shaped this \uc2 election\uc2  cycle. And in an era of sweeping consolidation, many smaller companies find themselves struggling to compete against multinational behemoths.\par \par \uc2 But while corporate executives are monitoring a laundry list of political and economic risks, no single factor appears to be a major cause for concern.\par \par \uc2 Instead, there is a growing sense that the combination of slow but steady economic growth, rapid technological innovation and an uncertain geopolitical landscape is here to stay for some time, or what business leaders call ''the new normal.''\par \par \uc2 ''You have a group of business leaders who have come of age only knowing uncertainty and complexity,'' said Blair W. Effron, co-founder of Centerview Partners, an investment bank that advises companies on big takeovers. ''They are therefore really good at managing in this environment.''\par \par \uc2 When it comes to mergers and acquisitions, that means companies are thinking about how to position themselves for unpredictable swings in consumer preferences and unanticipated changes in global markets, often through deal making.\par \par \uc2 For \uc2 AT&T\uc2 , the bet is about expanding beyond its roots as a distribution company. \uc2 AT&T\uc2  already offers phone, internet, cable and satellite services, but it has watched as \uc2 Comcast\uc2 , the country's largest cable operator, has expanded into content with its acquisition of \uc2 NBCUniversal\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 By buying \uc2 Time Warner\uc2  -- one of the most prestigious producers of television and film today, with brands including \uc2 HBO\uc2 , \uc2 CNN\uc2  and \uc2 Warner Bros\uc2 . -- \uc2 AT&T\uc2  will suddenly become \uc2 Comcast\uc2 's closest true rival.\par \par \uc2 ''\uc2 AT&T\uc2  is trying to keep up with the Joneses,'' said Robert Salomon, a professor at the New York University Stern School of Business.\par \par \uc2 For \uc2 British American Tobacco\uc2 , taking full control of \uc2 Reynolds American\uc2  means further expanding into the developing world as Americans and Europeans smoke less because of health concerns.\par \par \uc2 For the German company \uc2 Bayer\uc2 , which agreed last month to acquire the agricultural giant \uc2 Monsanto\uc2  for $56 billion, it is about gaining market share and getting leverage over customers.\par \par \uc2 And because interest rates remain so low, such deals are relatively easy to do these days.\par \par \uc2 ''Corporations are still sitting on record levels of cash, and there's not a lot of organic growth out there,'' Mr. Salomon said. ''If you can't grow organically, it's growth through acquisitions.''\par \par \uc2 In other industries, too, the pace of consolidation has quickened. Two big deals had appeared poised to reshape the American health care industry. Anthem has offered $48 billion for \uc2 Cigna\uc2 , and \uc2 Aetna\uc2  has offered $37 billion for \uc2 Humana\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 The Justice Department, however, has sued to block both deals, leaving their fates in jeopardy.\par \par \uc2 That's not the case in other industries, like technology, where there are few barriers to the big getting bigger. This summer, \uc2 Microsoft\uc2  agreed to buy \uc2 LinkedIn\uc2  for $26 billion.\par \par \uc2 All in all, the aggressive deal making -- coupled with a steady stock market and an economy that is growing, if modestly -- suggests that in a moment that could easily be fraught with uncertainty, many corporate leaders are surprisingly confident.\par \par \uc2 It has now been more than seven years since the United States economy dipped into recession, making this one of the longest periods of so-called expansion in American history. The longest, at 10 years, occurred during the 1990s, but economists believe that absent any major setbacks, that record could soon be broken.\par \par \uc2 ''There is a growing sense that this expansion has a ways to run,'' Mr. Zandi of \uc2 Moody's\uc2  said. ''People are getting comfortable with the idea that this is going for a while.''\par \par \uc2 Janet L. Yellen, on-screen, Fed chairwoman. Deals are going forward amid economic uncertainty.

\par\par \uc2 Politics; SECT\par \b \uc2 True or False? \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , a Native Chicagoan, Is a Cubs Fan\b0\par\par\uc2 By JONATHAN MAHLER \par \uc2 1,016 \uc2 words\par \uc2 24 October 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 The New York Times on the Web\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 It started with a photograph -- the shot retweeted round the world, if you will.\par \par \uc2 Snapped aboard \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's campaign plane late Saturday night by her traveling press secretary, Nick Merrill, the picture captured Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  staring at a smartphone, mouth agape in astonishment, as she watched the \uc2 Chicago Cubs\uc2  clinch a World Series berth.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Merrill posted the picture on \uc2 Twitter\uc2  at a little after 11. ''That look when you cap off a day on the trail by watching the @Cubs cement their trip to the #WorldSeries,'' he wrote.\par \par \uc2 That look when you cap off a day on the trail by watching the @Cubs cement their trip to the #WorldSeries. #FlyTheW pic.twitter.com/94KMWpKHwe -- Nick Merrill (@NickMerrill) October 23, 2016\par \par \uc2 Almost instantly, the image ricocheted across social media -- and kicked up a heated debate, one that cuts to the heart of the character and integrity of the Democratic presidential nominee: Was Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , a native Chicagoan who ostentatiously donned a \uc2 Yankees\uc2  hat during her 2000 campaign for the Senate from New York, really a Cubs fan at heart?\par \par \uc2 Or was she a baseball flip-flopper, cynically falling in behind whichever team was more advantageous in an \uc2 election\uc2  year?\par \par \uc2 The evidence was soon being parsed more carefully than her record on free trade.\par \par \uc2 An indictment was quickly circulated, and in one of Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's hometown papers, no less. (Or, shall we say, in one of the Chicago papers.)\par \par \uc2 ''It's time to recount \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's tortured explanations about being a die-hard Cubs fan -- and how she's also for the \uc2 Yankees\uc2 ,'' Lynn Sweet, a Sun-Times columnist, had written in a piece published on Thursday.\par \par \uc2 And yet the fact of Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's Cubs fandom is not really open to dispute.\par \par \uc2 Born in Chicago in 1947 -- two years after the team last appeared in the World Series -- Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  grew up in the suburbs, watching the Cubs on television with her brothers. They even re-enacted plays from the games, according to a newspaper column she wrote in the spring of 1996. Her father was a devoted fan, too, making her loyalty both geographic and genetic.\par \par \uc2 ''Even when baseball has tested my patience and allegiance, I've always managed to hold on to my soft spot for the Cubs,'' she wrote.\par \par \uc2 The source of suspicion as to Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's baseball loyalties is another set of facts: In 1999, only days after announcing that she was forming an exploratory committee to run for the Senate from New York, she and her husband, President \uc2 Bill \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , welcomed the \uc2 Yankees\uc2  to the White House for a visit. Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  donned a \uc2 Yankees\uc2  cap given to her by the team's manager, Joe Torre.\par \par \uc2 The resulting photographs fueled scorching criticism for years.\par \par \uc2 ''She went to the \uc2 Yankees\uc2  so that she could run for senator from New York,'' Chris Matthews said in 2007 on MSNBC's ''Hardball.'' ''It's so obvious. Why is she -- doesn't she know she looks like a fraud?''\par \par \uc2 In her defense, Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  has pointed to ample evidence, including interviews from the early 1990s, that as a young girl in Chicago, she followed the \uc2 Yankees\uc2  in addition to the Cubs because she ''needed an American League team,'' and ''in our neighborhood, it was nearly sacrilegious to cheer for the rival \uc2 White Sox\uc2 ,'' as she wrote in her 2003 memoir, ''Living History.''\par \par \uc2 As a 7-year-old, Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  recalled in a speech in 2011, she dressed up as Mickey Mantle for Halloween, adding, ''I have the picture to show you and to prove it.''\par \par \uc2 And in a lengthy 2007 profile, ''Growing Up Rodham,'' the respected Washington Post sports columnist \uc2 Sally Jenkins\uc2  had corroborated this claim: ''By age 10, Hillary was a tomboy obsessed with baseball, especially the switch-hitting Mickey Mantle.''\par \par \uc2 Claims and counterclaims about baseball fandom are almost inescapable in presidential \uc2 election\uc2  years, when the campaign inevitably bumps into the baseball postseason. Candidates are pressed to express a rooting interest -- ideally with a plausible pre-existing explanation.\par \par \uc2 And yet these are treacherous waters to wade into.\par \par \uc2 In 2004, \uc2 John Kerry\uc2  made the mistake of linking his candidacy's fate to that of his beloved, World Series bound \uc2 Boston Red Sox\uc2 . He compared himself to the team's lights-out closer, Keith Foulke, and vowed to disprove the notion of any ''curse'' on either him or the Sox.\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 Red Sox\uc2  won. Mr. Kerry did not.\par \par \uc2 At least no one could accuse him of national pastime pandering. The same cannot be said of other presidential candidates.\par \par \uc2 In 2008, \uc2 Barack Obama\uc2  told an audience in Philadelphia that because his \uc2 Chicago White Sox\uc2  had been knocked out of the playoffs, he was going to root for the \uc2 Phillies\uc2  against the \uc2 Tampa Bay Rays\uc2 . Not 10 days later, he joked with an audience in Florida that he was thinking about getting a mohawk, a trend at the time among hard-core Rays fans.\par \par \uc2 His opponent, \uc2 John McCain\uc2 , pounced: ''It's pretty simple, really. When he's campaigning in Philadelphia, he roots for the \uc2 Phillies\uc2 , and when he's campaigning in Tampa Bay, he shows love to the Rays.''\par \par \uc2 Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's dual loyalties, longstanding and verified or not, may be an affront to baseball purists, who believe that a true fan can only have one team. And some of today's Cubs fans may not feel that she deserves to share in their celebrations.\par \par \uc2 But there is no mistaking the look of bliss on Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's face in that photograph taken aboard the campaign plane. As any sports fan can attest, it is a state that not even the most gifted politician can manufacture.\par \par \uc2 Besides, if the goal was to pander to voters, she would be far better off rooting for the Cubs' swing-state opponents -- the \uc2 Cleveland Indians\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Find out what you need to know about the 2016 presidential race today, and get politics news updates via \uc2 Facebook\uc2 , \uc2 Twitter\uc2  and the First Draft newsletter.\par \par \uc2 Document NYTF000020161024ecao0004h\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 OP-ED CONTRIBUTOR\par \uc2 Editorial Desk; SECTA\par \b \uc2 Angry, but Not Anti-Immigrant\b0\par\par\uc2 By ANDY OSTROY \par \uc2 932 \uc2 words\par \uc2 24 October 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 21\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 On Nov. 1, 2006, I found my wife, Adrienne Shelly, dead in her West Village office. Adrienne, an actor and filmmaker, had been brutally murdered by a 19-year-old undocumented Ecuadorean construction worker; he later said they were having an argument and, fearing she would report him and have him deported, he killed her and staged her death so it would appear to be a suicide. Our daughter was just 2 years old at the time.\par \par \uc2 Given the anger and grief I still feel, I could easily be seduced by \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's anti-immigrant rhetoric that is the cornerstone of his presidential run. ''They're bringing drugs. They're bringing crime. They're rapists,'' he said as he began his campaign in 2015. And in these final weeks before the \uc2 election\uc2 , rather than tacking to the middle, he seems to be doubling down. ''We've got some bad hombres,'' he said in last week's debate, referring to immigrants who commit crimes.\par \par \uc2 And it's not just Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 . In the years since Adrienne's murder I've received several offers from prominent members of the conservative media, including Fox News' Bill O'Reilly and Megyn Kelly, to speak out on this issue and give legitimacy to right-wing anti-immigrant sentiment. Who better than a Democrat to attack an entire segment of our population, right?\par \par \uc2 But Adrienne was not murdered by an illegal immigrant, per se. She fell victim to a depraved killer who simply happened to be an undocumented immigrant. It is an obvious distinction, almost too obvious, but it's an important one to consider as the country goes further down the dangerous path of demonizing those not born here.\par \par \uc2 At his rallies and during the debates, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  has painted a dark picture of an America overrun by foreign criminals who come here to rape, pillage and murder our innocent civilians. He opposes any form of amnesty for the estimated 11 million undocumented immigrants living in the United States, taking a hard-line law-and-order stand that has brought millions of voters to his camp.\par \par \uc2 He uses murders like Adrienne's -- though never hers specifically, fortunately -- as political props. His ''solution'' includes a deportation force that would separate people from their families and ''send them back to wherever they came from.''\par \par \uc2 Adrienne's killer, Diego Pillco, plea-bargained a murder conviction that sentenced him to 25 years with no parole and no ability to appeal. It was a tough case. He had no clear motive, and there were no witnesses to the crime. The district attorney's office advised me to accept the deal rather than go to trial. It was an agonizing decision: roll the dice for a life sentence or possibly end up with a manslaughter conviction, with her killer receiving a meager three to five years in prison.\par \par \uc2 We took the deal. It was, simply, a business decision, albeit one with a hefty emotional price tag. Her killer will be deported upon his release, walking this earth a free man at 44 years old, while Adrienne's vibrant life was snuffed out at 40.\par \par \uc2 His reason for killing Adrienne, and the relatively lenient sentence he received, certainly feeds Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's xenophobic, fear-mongering narrative. But beyond the rhetoric, there's no clear cause and effect. His rationale was no different from that of an American citizen who in the act of a crime kills his ''witness'' to avoid prosecution and imprisonment. Attributing his heinous act to his immigration status dilutes the more relevant truth that he lacked the ability to know right from wrong and had zero respect for human life.\par \par \uc2 Yes, we have an immigration problem that is in desperate need of reform. Yes, some illegal immigrants commit crimes, some of them violent. But so do blacks, whites, Asians, Christians and Jews. Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  often claims that two million undocumented immigrants have been convicted of crimes, but in fact the figure is actually 176,000, according to \uc2 Immigration and Customs Enforcement\uc2 . The reality is, Americans have appreciably more to fear from their fellow citizens than from undocumented immigrants.\par \par \uc2 It's politically expedient for xenophobic agitators like Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  to scapegoat the millions of foreigners who have come to the United States in search of a better life. But his malevolence toward immigrants runs counter to the principles on which our great nation was founded. It's disheartening to see so many people being swept out to sea in a riptide of ignorance and hate.\par \par \uc2 America was created by, is governed by and -- with the exception of Native Americans -- is inhabited by immigrants and their descendants, generations of whom came here to escape religious and ethnic persecution. That millions of people face a similar fate on our soil is deplorable. We should be thanking them, as America's greatness is attributed to their blood, sweat, vision, perseverance, dedication and brilliance.\par \par \uc2 While I believe that the country must do more to secure its borders, deport noncitizencriminals and protect Americans from foreign terrorists, I also believe we must find a realistic, humane path to citizenship for the millions of decent, hard-working immigrants who love this country as much as I do, regardless of whether they are documented or not. We need the kind of compassionate reform that Democrats have been advocating for decades in the face of persistent Republican obstructionism.\par \par \uc2 That is what Adrienne would want.\par \par \uc2 Andy Ostroy is a marketing entrepreneur and political blogger.\par \par \uc2 DRAWING (DRAWING BY FRANCIS BEN) \par \par \uc2 Document NYTF000020161024ecao0003t\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw272\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4080\pichgoal600

\par\par \b \uc2 AT&T Faces Political Barrage\b0\par\par\uc2 By Thomas Gryta, Shalini Ramachandran and Rebecca Ballhaus   \par \uc2 898 \uc2 words\par \uc2 24 October 2016\par \uc2 The Wall Street Journal\par \uc2 J\par A1\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 AT&T Inc\uc2 .'s blockbuster $85.4 billion deal to buy \uc2 Time Warner Inc\uc2 . promises to reshape the media landscape -- if the companies can navigate a series of obstacles, including possible opposition from U.S. antitrust authorities and objections by lawmakers and media and telecom rivals.\par \par \uc2 Even before the deal was announced Saturday night, members of Congress, industry groups and Republican presidential nominee \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  began to question it, contending the combination of \uc2 AT&T\uc2 's millions of wireless and pay-television subscribers with \uc2 Time Warner\uc2 's stable of TV networks and programming would limit competition and hurt consumers.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  said if elected he wouldn't approve the deal "because it's too much concentration of power in the hands of too few."\par \par \uc2 Former presidential candidate Bernie Sanders on Sunday called on the administration to block the merger. "This deal would mean higher prices and fewer choices for the American people," Mr. Sanders wrote on \uc2 Twitter\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 On \uc2 NBC\uc2 's "Meet the Press" Sunday, Democratic Vice Presidential nominee Tim Kaine said he shared the "concerns and questions" raised by Democratic Minnesota Sen. Al Franken that the deal could lead to higher costs and fewer choices. "Pro-competition and less concentration, I think, is generally helpful, especially in the media."\par \par \uc2 Experts compared the deal to the acquisition by Comcast of NBCUniversal, which went through in 2011 after 13 months of review. U.S. regulatory officials and rivals have expressed concerns that some government conditions regarding \uc2 Comcast\uc2 's behavior, such as its requirement to not weigh in on strategic decisions at streaming service \uc2 Hulu\uc2 , were tough to monitor and enforce.\par \par \uc2 AT&T Chief Executive \uc2 Randall Stephenson\uc2  played down the objections from lawmakers, politicians and industry groups, arguing the combination of a content provider and a distributor didn't increase industry concentration and wasn't the kind of deal regulators take issue with.\par \par \uc2 "It is going to have to go through a regulatory review process that is dictated by rules, regulations and laws," Mr. Stephenson said in an interview.\par \par \uc2 AT&T\uc2  affirmed Sunday that it would continue to run \uc2 Time Warner\uc2 's media assets autonomously amid concerns among current and former staff particularly at \uc2 CNN\uc2  that editorial independence might be compromised. "\uc2 CNN\uc2  is an American symbol of independent journalism and First Amendment free speech. My board and I are clear -- \uc2 CNN\uc2  will remain completely independent from an editorial perspective," Mr. Stephenson said in a statement.\par \par \uc2 AT&T\uc2  is no stranger to Washington politics, including the bitter memory of having its 2011 acquisition of \uc2 T-Mobile US Inc\uc2 . blocked. Its political-action committee has been one of the top corporate contributions.\par \par \uc2 Regulators' questions will likely focus on whether \uc2 AT&T\uc2  would favor content acquired from \uc2 Time Warner\uc2 , if the merger would lead to higher prices, or if it would widen the playing field by making \uc2 AT&T\uc2  a stronger competitor.\par \par \uc2 AT&T\uc2  will likely have to meet conditions set by antitrust reviewers at the Justice Department as well as face regulators from the \uc2 Federal Communications Commission\uc2 , who will also likely conduct a public interest review of the deal.\par \par \uc2 "Avoiding any kind of regulatory review is always a benefit," Mr. Stephenson said. "But we aren't naive. We aren't thinking that that won't happen."\par \par \uc2 The Justice Department and FCC both declined to comment.\par \par \uc2 In the 2016 \uc2 election\uc2 , AT&T's PAC has given a total of $4.2 million to hundreds of candidates and groups in both parties, including $70,000 to a joint fundraising committee for House Speaker \uc2 Rep. Paul Ryan\uc2  (R., Wis.) and the maximum $5,000 to \uc2 Sen. Chuck Schumer\uc2  (D., N.Y.), considered the likely successor of departing Senate Minority Leader, Harry Reid of Nevada.\par \par \uc2 It was also a major donor to both political conventions, giving $1.5 million to the host committee for the Democratic convention and $4.2 million to the host committee for the Republican convention.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Stephenson is a longtime Republican donor. He gave $1,000 to Mr. Ryan in March, and last December gave $30,000 to the \uc2 Republican National Committee\uc2 , according to \uc2 Federal \uc2 Election\uc2  Commission\uc2  records. He supported Republican presidential nominee \uc2 Mitt Romney\uc2  in 2012 and hasn't donated to Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Time Warner CEO \uc2 Jeff Bewkes\uc2  has a far more sparse donation record. He hasn't donated to any campaigns this \uc2 election\uc2  cycle, according to \uc2 FEC\uc2  records.\par \par \uc2 Media companies and industry rivals such as \uc2 Walt Disney Co\uc2 ., which called for "close regulatory scrutiny" on Saturday, are expected to lobby for tough conditions that are enforceable, given the shadow of \uc2 Comcast\uc2 -NBCUniversal. Because this deal combines a content provider and a distributor instead of two direct rivals, lawyers, lobbyists and regulatory officials say divestitures are unlikely.\par \par \uc2 Industry executives believe \uc2 AT&T\uc2  will have a hard time shaking off worries in Washington it would favor \uc2 Time Warner\uc2  content on its vast combined wireline broadband and mobile footprint.\par \par \uc2 For Dallas-based \uc2 AT&T\uc2 , the task of negotiating Washington will fall on \uc2 Robert Quinn\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 His victories include shepherding the \uc2 AT&T\uc2 -BellSouth merger through an FCC commission with two Republicans and two Democrats, where the tiebreaker Republican had recused himself. The approval was unanimous.\par \par \uc2 ---\par \par \uc2 Bob Davis contributed to this article.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=wjco20161024000109"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document J000000020161024ecao0002r\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw272\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4080\pichgoal600

\par\par \b \uc2 Election\uc2  2016: Billionaires Give More to \uc2 Clinton\uc2  --- Wealthy donors spend $88 million on \uc2 election\uc2  with nominees vowing to curb their influence\b0\par\par\uc2 By Rebecca Ballhaus   \par \uc2 561 \uc2 words\par \uc2 24 October 2016\par \uc2 The Wall Street Journal\par \uc2 J\par A4\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 Two dozen billionaires have spent $88 million on the 2016 presidential campaign, bankrolling an \uc2 election\uc2  in which both major-party nominees have railed against the influence of money in politics.\par \par \uc2 Democrat \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  has been the largest beneficiary of billionaires' cash, with 19 of them donating a total of $70 million to her top allied super PAC, Priorities USA Action, according to the latest \uc2 Federal \uc2 Election\uc2  Commission\uc2  disclosure. Four billionaires have given $18 million to the set of super PACs backing Republican \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 The largest individual donor of the presidential \uc2 election\uc2  has been Donald Sussman, founder of Paloma Partners, a Greenwich, Conn., hedge fund. Mr. Sussman donated $19 million to Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's super PAC through September, and an aide said he donated $2 million more this month.\par \par \uc2 The second-largest donor has been \uc2 Robert Mercer\uc2 , an executive at the New York hedge fund \uc2 Renaissance Technologies\uc2 . Mr. Mercer, who earlier this cycle spent $13 million bankrolling a super PAC to support Texas Sen. Ted Cruz's presidential campaign, has since spent $2 million to support Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Including the billionaires, about 56 donors in both parties who wrote checks of $1 million or more have collectively given $200 million to outside groups backing both candidates. About 83% of those funds went to the pro-\uc2 Clinton\uc2  group, while 17% went to groups backing Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 The infusion of cash for the Republican nominee in recent weeks has helped his cause achieve near parity with Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's camp in at least one area. Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's super PACs entered the final full month of the \uc2 election\uc2  with $19 million in the bank; the \uc2 Clinton\uc2  super PAC's coffers heading into October totaled $22 million, although it has spent far more than the \uc2 Trump\uc2  allies.\par \par \uc2 Together, Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  and their allied super PACs -- political-action committees that can raise unlimited sums from individuals, companies and unions to spend on campaign activity -- have raised nearly $900 million through September. In 2012, President \uc2 Barack Obama\uc2  and Mr. Romney collectively raised $1.7 billion for their campaigns and allied super PACs -- the most ever raised for an \uc2 election\uc2  cycle.\par \par \uc2 The torrent of super PAC money has dramatically changed presidential politics in the wake of a 2010 Supreme Court ruling known as \uc2 Citizens United\uc2  that opened the door to unlimited contributions to these outside groups. It also comes as both Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  and Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  have pledged to curtail wealthy donors' influence in politics. Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  has said she would appoint Supreme Court justices who would reverse \uc2 Citizens United\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  spent the primary stressing that he was self-funding his campaign and criticizing his opponents for being beholden to special interests. But after becoming his party's nominee, he hired as a deputy campaign manager \uc2 David Bossie\uc2 , the president of \uc2 Citizens United\uc2 , the conservative group that brought the Supreme Court case, and approved the creation ofhis own super PACs.\par \par \uc2 All told, Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's super PAC raised $155 million through September, according to the \uc2 election\uc2  commission. Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's set of super PACs raised $50 million in that period, bolstered by a late injection of $24 million by five Republican megadonors.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=wjco20161024000097"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document J000000020161024ecao0002f\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw272\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4080\pichgoal600

A review of Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's emails concluded that 110 messages contained classified information. Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  has said she made a mistake but that she never sent or received messages that were marked classified.\par \par \uc2 At the end of July 2015, Mr. McCabe was promoted to \uc2 FBI\uc2  headquarters and assumed the No. 3 position at the agency.\par \par \uc2 In February 2016, he became FBI Director James Comey's second-in-command.\par \par \uc2 As deputy director, Mr. McCabe was part of the executive leadership team overseeing the \uc2 Clinton\uc2  email investigation, though \uc2 FBI\uc2  officials say any final decisions on that probe were made by Mr. Comey.\par \par \uc2 (See related article: "\uc2 Clinton\uc2  Ally Aided \uc2 FBI\uc2  Wife --- Virginia governor's PAC donated nearly $500,000 to an \uc2 FBI\uc2  spouse's campaign" -- WSJ October 24, 2016)\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=wjco20161024000096"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document J000000020161024ecao0002e\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw272\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4080\pichgoal600

\par\par \b \uc2 Clinton\uc2  Ally Aided \uc2 FBI\uc2  Wife --- Virginia governor's PAC donated nearly $500,000 to an \uc2 FBI\uc2  spouse's campaign\b0\par\par\uc2 By Devlin Barrett   \par \uc2 850 \uc2 words\par \uc2 24 October 2016\par \uc2 The Wall Street Journal\par \uc2 J\par A1\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 The political organization of Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe, an influential Democrat with longstanding ties to Bill and \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , gave nearly $500,000 to the \uc2 election\uc2  campaign of the wife of an official at the \uc2 Federal Bureau of Investigation\uc2  who later helped oversee the investigation into Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's email use.\par \par \uc2 Campaign finance records show Mr. McAuliffe's political-action committee donated $467,500 to the 2015 state Senate campaign of Dr. Jill McCabe, who is married to Andrew McCabe, now the deputy director of the FBI.\par \par \uc2 The Virginia Democratic Party, over which Mr. McAuliffe exerts considerable control, donated an additional $207,788 worth of support to Dr. McCabe's campaign in the form of mailers, according to the records. That adds up to slightly more than $675,000 to her candidacy from entities either directly under Mr. McAuliffe's control or strongly influenced by him. The figure represents more than a third of all the campaign funds Dr. McCabe raised in the effort.\par \par \uc2 Mr. McAuliffe and other state party leaders recruited Dr. McCabe to run, according to party officials. She lost the \uc2 election\uc2  to incumbent Republican Dick Black.\par \par \uc2 A spokesman for the governor said he "supported Jill McCabe because he believed she would be a good state senator. This is a customary practice for Virginia governors. . . Any insinuation that his support was tied to anything other than his desire to elect candidates who would help pass his agenda is ridiculous."\par \par \uc2 Among political candidates that year, Dr. McCabe was the third-largest recipient of funds from Common Good VA, the governor's PAC, according to campaign finance records. Dan Gecker received $781,500 from the PAC and $214,456 from the state party for a campaign that raised $2.9 million, according to records; and Jeremy McPike received $803,500 from the PAC and $535,162 from the state party, raising more $3.8 million that year for his candidacy.\par \par \uc2 The governor could recall only one meeting with Mr. McCabe -- when he and other state Democrats met with the couple on March 7, 2015, to urge Dr. McCabe to run, according to the spokesman.\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 FBI\uc2  said in a statement that during his wife's campaign Mr. McCabe "played no role, attended no events, and did not participate in fundraising or support of any kind. Months after the completion of her campaign, then-Associate Deputy Director McCabe was promoted to Deputy, where, in that position, he assumed for the first time, an oversight role in the investigation into Secretary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's emails."\par \par \uc2 FBI\uc2  officials said that after that meeting with the governor in Richmond on March 7, Mr. McCabe sought ethics advice from the bureau and followed it, avoiding involvement with public corruption cases in Virginia, and avoiding any campaign activity or events.\par \par \uc2 Mr. McCabe's supervision of the \uc2 Clinton\uc2  email case in 2016 wasn't seen as a conflict or an ethics issue because his wife's campaign was over by then and Mr. McAuliffe wasn't part of the probe, officials said.\par \par \uc2 "Once I decided to run," Dr. McCabe said, "my husband had no formal role in my campaign other than to be a supportive husband to me and our children. As a federal official. . .everyone who participated in our campaign understood and respected that he could not participate."\par \par \uc2 Mr. McCabe is a longtime \uc2 FBI\uc2  official who focused much of his career on terrorism. His wife is a hospital physician who campaigned in northern Virginia, where the couple live.\par \par \uc2 The 2015 Virginia State senate race was Dr. McCabe's first run for office and her campaign spent $1.8 million. The race was part of Mr. McAuliffe's failed effort to win a Democratic majority in the Virginia legislature, which would have given him significantly more sway in Richmond, the state capital.\par \par \uc2 Mr. McAuliffe has been a central figure in the Clintons' political careers for decades. In the 1990s, he was \uc2 Bill \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's chief fundraiser and he remains one of the couple's closest allies and public boosters.\par \par \uc2 Mr. McAuliffe has been under investigation for months by the \uc2 FBI\uc2 's Washington field office, a probe that includes an examination of donations made on behalf of a Chinese businessman, according to people familiar with the matter. His lawyers have denied any wrongdoing and said the investigation is seeking to determine if Mr. McAuliffe may have violated a law requiring people to register as agents of a foreign entity.\par \par \uc2 It was unclear the extent to which Mr. McCabe may have recused himself from discussions involving Mr. McAuliffe. When Mr. McCabe's wife began her campaign, he shied away from involvement in Virginia public corruption cases, according to officials.\par \par \uc2 Once the campaign was over, officials said, Mr. McCabe and \uc2 FBI\uc2  officials felt the potential conflict-of-interest issues ended.\par \par \uc2 (See related article: "\uc2 Election\uc2  2016: A Candidate's Campaign, an Email Probe and a Spouse's Promotion" -- WSJ October 24, 2016)\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=wjco20161024000095"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document J000000020161024ecao0002d\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw272\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4080\pichgoal600

\par\par \b \uc2 Election\uc2  2016: \uc2 Trump\uc2  Makes Push in Florida\b0\par\par\uc2 By Beth Reinhard and Janet Hook   \par \uc2 574 \uc2 words\par \uc2 24 October 2016\par \uc2 The Wall Street Journal\par \uc2 J\par A4\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 As \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2 's path to the presidency appears to narrow, the GOP nomineeon Sunday hunkered down in Florida, one of a handful of swing states that polls suggest remain competitive.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  is slated to headline five rallies over three days in the nation's largest battleground, where more than a million voters have already mailed in ballots. In-person early voting begins Monday.\par \par \uc2 Democrats are holding their own against Republicans in mail-in ballots in Florida, a mode of voting that the GOP traditionally dominates, according to University of Florida political-science professor Daniel A. Smith. The state reports the party affiliation of people sending back ballots.\par \par \uc2 The more traction Democrats gain in early voting, the harder it will be for Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  to catch up, even if polls narrow near \uc2 Election\uc2  Day.\par \par \uc2 At a rally Sunday in the heavily Republican retirement community of Naples, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  said his campaign in Florida looks "phenomenal." He also said polls around the country are underestimating his support among women.\par \par \uc2 "We are going to win the great state of Florida and we are going to win back the White House," Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  said in a county where Republicans outnumber Democrats by a 2-to-1 ratio. "There is the same enthusiasm all over the country."\par \par \uc2 Polls show a number of pivotal states slipping away from Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , with the exception of Iowa, where he still leads Democrat \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 . The race remains tight in the hot spots of Ohio, North Carolina and Nevada.\par \par \uc2 Surveys also showcloser-than-expectedraces in traditionally reliably Republican states, including Arizona, Georgia and Utah.\par \par \uc2 In Texas, last carried by a Democrat in 1976, Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  is trailing by only 3 points, according to a new \uc2 CBS News\uc2  Battleground Tracker poll -- though other polls show Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  ahead there by 5 to 8 percentage points.\par \par \uc2 "We are behind," Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's campaign manager, Kellyanne Conway, said Sunday on \uc2 NBC\uc2 , citing Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's $66 million in ads in September and high-powered surrogates. "She's seen as the incumbent. So our advantage going in when we're behind. . .is that \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  is just going to continue to take the case directly to the people."\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  will appear in northern and central parts of Florida on Monday and Tuesday, while the \uc2 Clinton\uc2  campaign seeks to drive up turnout in the more liberal southern region.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  made a symbolic trip Saturday to the storied battlefield of Gettysburg in Pennsylvania. The campaign billed the speech as his closing argument and agenda for his first 100 days in office, but that message was overshadowed by Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's threats to sue the women who have accused him of sexual misconduct. "All of these liars will be sued after the \uc2 election\uc2  is over," he said.\par \par \uc2 He also stepped up his attacks on the media by assailing the proposed merger of \uc2 AT&T Inc\uc2 . and \uc2 Time Warner Inc\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 On his first day in office, the New York businessman said he would propose term limits on members of Congress, a hiring freeze at some federal agencies, new restrictions on lobbying by former government officials and new limits on regulations.\par \par \uc2 He said he would implement his trade agenda by announcing plans to renegotiate the \uc2 North American Free Trade Agreement\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 ---\par \par \uc2 Kate Davidson contributed to this article.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=wjco20161024000092"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document J000000020161024ecao0002a\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw272\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4080\pichgoal600

\par\par \b \uc2 Election\uc2  2016: Democrat Looks to Nov. 8, and Beyond\b0\par\par\uc2 By Peter Nicholas   \par \uc2 604 \uc2 words\par \uc2 24 October 2016\par \uc2 The Wall Street Journal\par \uc2 J\par A4\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 RALEIGH, N.C. -- \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  is devoting more attention to the postelection landscape, working to bolster Democratic numbers in Congress and trying to set voter expectations about what she could realistically achieve should she win.\par \par \uc2 Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  still talks about Republican rival \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  on the trail, but she seems more resistant to directly engaging an opponent who has been losing ground in the polls.\par \par \uc2 The Democratic nominee told reporters she no longer wants to spend time parrying Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , having stood on stage with him for three presidential debates. Aboard her campaign plane this weekend, she said: "I debated him for 4 1/2 hours. I don't even think about responding to him anymore."\par \par \uc2 Inside her campaign, advisers have begun thinking through ways to curb the bitterness unleashed by the \uc2 election\uc2  in the event she wins.\par \par \uc2 At a late-night rally in Philadelphia on Saturday, Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  made overtures to \uc2 Trump\uc2  voters, saying, "I want to be your president, too, and will work for you, and I will fight for you, as well."\par \par \uc2 But a \uc2 Clinton\uc2  agenda could easily stall unless Democrats win extraordinary victories on Nov. 8and take control of both the House and Senate from Republicans. President \uc2 Barack Obama\uc2  saw much of his policy agenda stymied by Congress after he lost his governing majority in the 2010 midterm elections.\par \par \uc2 Should she win in November, Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  seems to want to avoid a scenario in which voters feel let down if progress is sluggish.\par \par \uc2 "I'm not going to pretend that we can just snap our fingers and solve our problems," she said at a rally in a high-school gym in Pittsburgh. "That doesn't happen in the real world."\par \par \uc2 A good chunk of Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's speeches now centers on House and Senate races that could tip the balance of power. If Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  is elected, Democrats would need to pick up four seats to control the Senate, given that Mr. Kaine would be enlisted to break a tie vote. The Democrats' chore to flip control of the House is much steeper: They would need a net gain of 30 seats.\par \par \uc2 Speaking to a crowd of about 3,500 in Raleighon Sunday, Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  mentioned North Carolina Democrat Deborah Ross, who is running against Republican Sen.

\par\par \b \uc2 Election\uc2  2016: Florida House District Is A Tough Hold for the GOP\b0\par\par\uc2 By Michelle Hackman   \par \uc2 538 \uc2 words\par \uc2 24 October 2016\par \uc2 The Wall Street Journal\par \uc2 J\par A6\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 ORLANDO, Fla. -- The Republican Party's battle to retain its majority in the House of Representatives runs through districts like this one in suburban, central Florida, where a young woman with an immigrant story and a national-security background is trying to end the 23-year tenure of an incumbent Republican.\par \par \uc2 Rep. John Mica, 73 years old, was first elected in 1992. He is widely recognized in the district as a former House Transportation Committee chairman, who drew funds to the area to rebuild a major highway and construct a commuter rail line.\par \par \uc2 But court-ordered redistricting in 2015 rejiggered the shape of the district, which includes downtown Orlando and its northern suburbs. The redrawn lines made the district's population younger and more racially diverse. The race is rated a tossup by two independent analysts, the Cook Political Report and the Rothenberg & Gonzales Political Report.\par \par \uc2 If Democrats regain a House majority in this or future elections, it likely will be the result of winning suburban districts such as this one, more so than by retaking the working-class districts that have tilted to the GOP in recent years, said Dave Wasserman, who analyzes House races for the Cook Political Report.\par \par \uc2 Democrats struggled to recruit a strong challenger until June, when Stephanie Murphy, a 38-year-old college professor and former national security specialist at the Defense Department, filed papers to run just one day ahead of the deadline. As an infant, Ms. Murphy escaped Vietnam on a boat with her family. She offers a refugee story that contrasts with messages skeptical of immigration that have come from some Republicans recently.\par \par \uc2 Ms. Murphy has cited June's mass shooting at a gay nightclub in Orlando, which killed 49 and injured many others, as a reason she decided to join the race. She has highlighted Mr. Mica's stance on gun rights, such as a vote he cast against broadened background checks, and his vote against a bill that would have expanded protections against discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Mica frames the nightclub shooting as an example of national security vulnerability.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Mica supports \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  as the GOP presidential nominee, a position that Democrats have worked to highlight.\par \par \uc2 In an interview, Mr. Mica said: "I'm running my own campaign and telling people I'm supporting the Republican nominee, which I have always done. But I try to stay away from the national politics scene as much as possible."\par \par \uc2 Like most incumbents, Mr. Mica has raised more money than his challenger. He brought in $1.1 million since the beginning of 2015 through Sept. 30, compared with the $600,000 that Ms. Murphy raised since the end of June.\par \par \uc2 But Democrats and their allies have sensed opportunity, and they have poured in $4.5 million through the party's congressional campaign arm and affiliated super PAC. The GOP's congressional campaign arm hasn't entered the race.\par \par \uc2 "If money could buy a race, that's what they're aiming for," Mr. Mica said of the efforts by the national Democratic groups.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=wjco20161024000083"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document J000000020161024ecao00022\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw272\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4080\pichgoal600

\par\par \b \uc2 World News -- Analysis: Fight for Mosul Resonates in U.S.\b0\par\par\uc2 By Carol E. Lee   \par \uc2 693 \uc2 words\par \uc2 24 October 2016\par \uc2 The Wall Street Journal\par \uc2 J\par A8\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 WASHINGTON -- The U.S.-backed fight to wrest Iraq's second-largest city from Islamic State control holds implications extending beyond the battlefield and into both the departing and incoming U.S. presidential administrations, raising the stakes for how it unfolds in the closing weeks of the \uc2 election\uc2  campaign.\par \par \uc2 For President \uc2 Barack Obama\uc2 , Mosul is reverberating beyond his broader fight against Islamic State and into his legacy as a reluctant wartime president. It is an opportunity for Mr. Obama to secure a victory in a region that has given him few, but also a risky operation that has put his foreign policy under renewed scrutiny.\par \par \uc2 For Democrat \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  and Republican \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2 , one of whom will inherit the Islamic State fight in January, the battle for Mosul has spotlighted their contrasting positions. Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  has said she would attempt to defeat Islamic State without resorting to the use of U.S. combat forces, while Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  points to Mosul as evidence of the failures of the administration in which Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  served.\par \par \uc2 The challenges and stakes of the battle were underscored last week by the death of a U.S. sailor, the first U.S. service member killed during the fight over Mosul. In a signal of the importance of the offensive both to the Obama administration and to the wider fight, Defense Secretary Ash Carter spent the weekend in Iraq, meeting with top officials and traveling outside Baghdad for meetings.\par \par \uc2 In Erbil on Sunday, Mr. Carter said taking back control of Mosul and Raqqa, Syria, was crucial but wouldn't spell the end of Islamic State.\par \par \uc2 "It is absolutely essential that we destroy ISIL in these cities of Mosul and Raqqa, however, even in Iraq and Syria, that doesn't end the campaign," Mr. Carter said, using another name for Islamic State. "We know that ISIL will take to other, lesser locations in the countryside in Iraq, to take the Iraq example, and we are all planning to help the Iraqi Security Forces to consolidate their control over all of Iraqi territory. "\par \par \uc2 Richard Haass\uc2 , president of the \uc2 Council on Foreign Relations\uc2 , said Mr. Obama's reluctance to intervene in the conflict in Syria is more likely to define his legacy than the fight in Mosul.\par \par \uc2 But the battle in Mosul, paired with a future coordinated campaign in Raqqa, could hold strategic implications, said Ilan Goldenberg, director of the Middle East Security Program at the Center for a New American Security, a think tank with ties to the Obama administration.\par \par \uc2 "It's probably the most significant test of what I would argue is a new strategy and approach to how we deal with terrorist organizations," Mr. Goldenberg said. That strategy, he said, entails using U.S. Special Forces to assist local forces in fights where terrorist groups control territory. It contrasts with two other U.S. strategies: taking a hands-off approach; and sending large numbers of U.S. ground troops.\par \par \uc2 "I think the next president can really pick this up, talk about it as a strategic doctrine over time," Mr. Goldenberg said.\par \par \uc2 The Mosul battle could have a slight bearing on the U.S. presidential campaign. If the city is liberated quickly, it could benefit Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  by suggesting momentum has turned away from Islamic State, Mr. Haass said. But if it is drawn out, as many experts forecast, it could boost Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's argument that the problem was created by the Obama administration's decision to completely withdraw from Iraq in 2011.\par \par \uc2 The issue played into a bitter exchange during the final debate between Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  and Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  last week. The Republican candidate criticized the administration for announcing the start of the operation in advance and said the liberation effort wouldn't have been necessary if Mr. Obama, along with Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  as secretary of state, had persuaded the Iraqi government to keep some U.S. troops in Iraq at the end of the war in 2011.\par \par \uc2 ---\par \par \uc2 Gordon Lubold in Erbil, Iraq, contributed to this article.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=wjco20161024000044"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document J000000020161024ecao0000z\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw272\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4080\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 Heard on the Street\par \b \uc2 Vote Keeps Trade Quiet, For Now\b0\par\par\uc2 By Justin Lahart   \par \uc2 279 \uc2 words\par \uc2 24 October 2016\par \uc2 The Wall Street Journal\par \uc2 J\par C6\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 [Financial Analysis and Commentary]\par \par \uc2 For the stock market, the next few weeks through \uc2 Election\uc2  Day could look a bit like a fox trot: slow, slow, quick, quick.\par \par \uc2 Rarely have investors been so confident of what a presidential \uc2 election\uc2 's results will be as they are now. But rarely have the consequences of being wrong been so high. \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , the status-quo candidate, is meaningfully ahead in the polls. But if \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2 , who is running a highly unconventional campaign, wins, it could create a highly uncertain situation.\par \par \uc2 Put differently, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  is a tail risk -- something investors don't think will happen but would matter a lot if it does. There is a tail risk on the other side, too: If Democrats are able to capture not just the Senate, but the House, Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  would face few roadblocks to enacting her agenda.\par \par \uc2 Investors' solution: Stop trading and take out a little protection. Stock-market trading volumes are unusually low. Prices of index options, which act as insurance against market swings, expiring right after the \uc2 election\uc2  are notably higher than options expiring right before it.\par \par \uc2 It isn't all that different from what investors do in front of other binary events such as \uc2 Federal Reserve\uc2  meetings where the chances of a rate increase are low, says Pravit Chintawongvanich, head derivatives strategist at Macro Risk Advisors. The difference is that being wrong on an unexpected \uc2 election\uc2  outcome could be a lot worse than being wrong on an unexpected rate increase.\par \par \uc2 The day after \uc2 Election\uc2  Day should be interesting.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=wjco20161024000037"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document J000000020161024ecao0000s\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw272\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4080\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 Playa del Carmen, Mexico -- A \uc2 Pew Research Center\uc2  poll released in July reported that 84% of U.S. voters said that the economy is "very important" to their vote in the Nov. 8 \uc2 election\uc2 . It was the top issue for respondents.\par \par \uc2 Yet it is becoming clearer that \uc2 Federal Reserve\uc2  policies are causing great damage to the U.S. economy, and neither candidate has made it a campaign issue. Instead, \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  and \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  blame too much economic freedom for the malaise. This is troubling no matter who wins the \uc2 election\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 In three days visiting this resort town last week, I did not meet one person in the local hospitality industry who was born here. Whether it was hotel staff, restaurant employees or transportation detail, all had come from other states -- Tabasco, Guerrero, Oaxaca, Morelos, to name a few -- in search of work.\par \par \uc2 This job creation is driven by productivity gains that would have been unimaginable without corresponding increases in free trade and mobility and investments in technology and human capital. It's how economies grow.\par \par \uc2 Yet our political class and intellectuals increasingly point to these developments -- technology, trade and migration -- as reasons for pessimism. It is worrisome logic because it suggests that a better future depends on going backward, against the grain of economic liberalism. It also ignores the Fed's culpability for slow growth.\par \par \uc2 Innovation and competition generate what Austrian economist Joseph Schumpeter called "creative destruction." In a free market with sound money, the wealth created by disruption is redeployed, providing opportunities for those who were displaced. This boosts productivity further.\par \par \uc2 Fed policies of zero interest rates and bond buying -- quantitative easing -- have not only failed to stimulate business investment. They have discouraged it through the misallocation of capital. This is contractionary because it starves entrepreneurship and thus productivity growth.\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 North American Free Trade Agreement\uc2  (\uc2 Nafta\uc2 ) opened the Mexican economy to Canadian and U.S. imports in 1994. Many Mexicans lost jobs. Yet the country gained access to what it needed to modernize. Running water, salmon entrees, California wines and air conditioning were not standard fare here on the Mayan Riviera in 1985. They are now, and tourism has boomed.\par \par \uc2 Both Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  and Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  talk about the need for faster U.S. growth. Yet both propose to get there by cracking down on free markets. Both prescribe new restrictions on international trade and a new entitlement program for preschool children.\par \par \uc2 Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  wants government to take a bigger tax bite from the most productive members of society, a policy that would discourage risk-taking by those same individuals. Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  demagogues immigration and wants to punish U.S. companies that allocate capital to its highest use if that happens to be abroad.\par \par \uc2 Left out of their analyses is the gargantuan role of the \uc2 Federal Reserve\uc2 's antigrowth monetary and regulatory policies. Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  argued in September that the Fed's eight-year policy of cheap credit is generating asset bubbles. But if he understood the problem he wouldn't rail against Nafta.\par \par \uc2 Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  feigns alarm at Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's criticism of the Fed on grounds that the central bank is supposed to be independent. Yet it is well known that Democrats are working behind the scenes to weaken the independence of the regional Fed banks to centralize power in Washington.\par \par \uc2 Conventional wisdom holds that the Fed has flooded the market with credit by aggressively buying bonds and creating bank reserves on the Fed balance sheet. Yet when the Fed buys assets -- such as government debt or mortgage-backed securities -- it only records a short-term liability on the balance sheet. The reserves are on the books but don't create any more credit in the real economy than if the Fed never made the purchase. Meanwhile it creates shortages of medium- and long-term assets in the market.\par \par \uc2 If there were a glut of credit in the real economy it would likely show up in bank lending as expanding businesses clamored for low-cost loans. Yet credit growth "has been dismally slow," wrote David Malpass, president of the consulting firm Encima Global in a recent note to clients. The term structure of bank assets is partly to blame, but so is regulation -- by the Fed and Congress, via 2010 Dodd-Frank legislation -- which has made it difficult to lend to businesses, especially small ones.\par \par \uc2 The most creditworthy companies are using cheap money not in productivity-increasing ventures but to pay dividends, buy back stock or engage in other financial transactions. Fed policies, as Mr. Malpass wrote, are "reducing the credit available to smaller businesses and hurting GDP growth rather than stimulating it."\par \par \uc2 The Fed is technically an "independent agency" but it is not unanswerable to the public it serves. Blaming the free market for its mistakes will only make things worse.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=wjco20161024000023"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document J000000020161024ecao0000e\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 National Desk; SECTA\par \b \uc2 Trump\uc2  Recording Narrows National Divide on Sexual Assault\b0\par\par\uc2 By AMANDA TAUB \par \uc2 1,600 \uc2 words\par \uc2 23 October 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 4\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 CORRECTION APPENDEDOf all the silver linings one might have expected from this whiplash-crazy \uc2 election\uc2 , a new national understanding of sexual assault would have been quite hard to imagine.\par \par \uc2 Until two weeks ago.\par \par \uc2 One three-minute recording of Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2  boasting about how his stardom gave him license to grope women's private parts appears to have prompted the kind of change in public consciousness that usually takes decades.\par \par \uc2 The lewd and aggressive comments by Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , the Manhattan tycoon turned Republican presidential nominee, revealed a generational divide in the way many Americans understand sexual assault and consent. But, remarkably, the widespread outrage and outpouring it unleashed, with millions of women speaking out about their own experiences -- appear to have narrowed that gap.\par \par \uc2 ''This is a moment of transition,'' said Estelle B. Freedman, a Stanford University historian who studies the evolution of laws and norms surrounding sexual assault.\par \par \uc2 ''We are having a national conversation about new rules,'' she added. ''We are nationally trying to rethink issues of sexuality, consent, autonomy, relationships.''\par \par \uc2 Redefining Consent\par \par \uc2 While the \uc2 Trump\uc2  tape and its aftermath feel like a turning point in the public understanding of sexual assault, \uc2 Alexandra Brodsky\uc2 , a co-founder of Know Your IX, an organization dedicated to ending sexual violence on college campuses, believes that ''it's actually a reflection that we are already past the turning point.''\par \par \uc2 ''It is not obvious to me that five years ago, grabbing or kissing someone without her permission would have been recognized as sexual assault,'' she said.\par \par \uc2 Dr. Freedman sees this moment as the culmination of decades of change.\par \par \uc2 Until the mid-19th century, her research shows, sexual assault and rape were viewed primarily as crimes against the honor of women's husbands and fathers, not themselves. As women gained new rights to control their own property and legal decisions, sexual assault began to be considered a matter of consent, not honor.\par \par \uc2 But there was little agreement about what consent meant, Dr. Freedman said. Many people believed consent could be implied or presumed by the way a woman dressed, for instance, or even her decision to accept a job with a male boss.\par \par \uc2 By the 1990s, feminist advocacy had begun to push the idea of ''no means no.'' \uc2 Antioch College\uc2  in 1991 adopted a code of conduct requiring students to affirmatively opt in to sexual activity starting with a kiss.\par \par \uc2 While such affirmative-consent rules were lampooned on ''Saturday Night Live'' as political correctness run amok, they have become increasingly mainstream. States including New York and California require colleges and universities to adopt them.\par \par \uc2 The widespread backlash to Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's comments, experts say, was fueled in part by the growing view, among people in their 20s and 30s, of affirmative consent as a guiding principle, not a lofty ideal or extreme demand.\par \par \uc2 ''I think that affirmative consent is an imperfect legal concept,'' Ms. Brodsky, a recent graduate of Yale Law School, allowed. ''But it's a powerful normative concept.''\par \par \uc2 But old beliefs about honor and consent persist.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's bragging in the video that women ''let'' him kiss and grope them because he was a star, for instance, seems straight out of the implied-consent era, in which anything other than a clear ''no'' could be seen as passive acquiescence.\par \par \uc2 Dr. Freedman also detects shades of the old honor-based system in some men's responses that, as husbands and fathers, they found the video unacceptable.\par \par \uc2 To Speak or Stay Silent?\par \par \uc2 Until recently, pervasive shame and stigma meant that silence was often the rational choice for survivors of sexual violence. That was particularly true for women who grew up in an era when any sexual activity outside of marriage was considered unacceptable: revealing an assault risked being labeled promiscuous or worse.\par \par \uc2 But as those norms have changed, the costs of speaking out have dropped.\par \par \uc2 Younger women in particular are becoming more willing to protest sexual assaults that once might have been deemed too minor to merit reporting. And that, in turn, may be affecting the way older generations of women perceive episodes from their own pasts.\par \par \uc2 It certainly worked that way for Emily Hoffman, 25, who works in the television industry in New York, and her mother, Amy Plummer.\par \par \uc2 ''I really don't want to post this,'' Ms. Hoffman wrote on \uc2 Facebook\uc2  on Oct. 10, a few days after the \uc2 Trump\uc2  tape was aired. But she went on to reveal to her 1,326 \uc2 Facebook\uc2  friends what for seven years had been one of her most private secrets: that she had been assaulted by a senior male colleague while an 18-year-old intern at a film-promotion company.\par \par \uc2 He attacked her in a deserted stairwell, Ms. Hoffman announced, kissing her, groping her breasts and genitals, and then forcibly masturbating against her.\par \par \uc2 ''My experience mimicked what Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  described in those tapes,'' she said in an interview. ''It was very upsetting.''\par \par \uc2 For Ms. Plummer, who is in her 60s, seeing her daughter's post was transformative.\par \par \uc2 ''When Emily felt brave enough to put her experiences down was when I specifically started to think about my own experiences,'' she said. ''And I realized I would not have had the courage she had to say it publicly.''\par \par \uc2 But she also realized she had things of her own to share. She still felt that some of her experiences were too ''explicit'' to discuss. But she shared others with her daughter.\par \par \uc2 How in junior high, for instance, her male guidance counselor told her that she should ''consider a career as a Playboy bunny.'' And how she left graduate school without her master's degree after a professor told her that she would not be able to pass her oral exams ''unless I was 'nice' to him.''\par \par \uc2 Naming Names\par \par \uc2 One thing is notably missing from most of the stories survivors are now sharing: perpetrators' names. The stigma of having been assaulted may have waned, but making an accusation against a specific individual is a different matter.\par \par \uc2 It can raise the risk of legal consequences such as libel or slander suits. Many survivors, however, say social consequences are a more significant deterrent.\par \par \uc2 ''There is a sense that a 'good victim' merely shares her story to raise awareness or make people feel less alone,'' Ms. Brodsky said. ''But the minute there is a desire for accountability or change or retribution, suddenly she's untrustworthy.''\par \par \uc2 When women accuse celebrities or other high-profile people like Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  or Roger Ailes, the former Fox News executive, she said, ''that triggers the unfounded but insidious myth that women say that they've been assaulted for attention or money.''\par \par \uc2 The pressure not to name names can be strong whenever the perpetrator is someone the woman knows. An accusation forces everyone who knows the two people to choose a side: accuser or accused? Choosing the accuser often means going against the broader group or community.\par \par \uc2 In her work on college campuses around the country, Ms. Brodsky said, she has observed that ''peers and friends are much more inclined to be sympathetic to victims if they don't make anyone's life more complicated.''\par \par \uc2 ''Naming names creates an inconvenience,'' she added.\par \par \uc2 Psychological research shows that people find it extremely difficult -- even painful -- to challenge their peer groups. In the famous ''conformity study'' conducted by Solomon Asch, a professor of social psychology at the University of Pennsylvania who died in 1996, participants were asked to answer a series of simple, questions with obvious answers. There was a catch, though: Before the subject had a chance to respond, other research assistants disguised as participants all confidently selected the same wrong answer.\par \par \uc2 That set up a dilemma: Choose the right answer, or conform to the group by selecting the wrong one? Even though the stakes were very low, about three-quarters of participants capitulated to group pressure at least once.\par \par \uc2 Ms. Hoffman believes that her decision not to name her accuser is the reason her post has received such a uniformly positive response. ''I'm not naming anybody in particular,'' she said. ''So they don't feel like there's somebody who they need to defend.''\par \par \uc2 But according to the \uc2 federal Bureau of Justice Statistics\uc2 , 60 percent of sexual assaults are committed by an intimate partner, relative, friend or acquaintance. So the pressure on individuals not to name names can add up to widespread impunity for perpetrators.\par \par \uc2 Nancy Erika Smith, a New Jersey lawyer who has represented victims of sexual assault and discrimination for more than two decades, said she recognized that asking people to identify who had harmed them was in many ways an unfair burden.\par \par \uc2 ''Don't do it for yourself,'' she said. ''Do it for all of us. Speak up.''\par \par \uc2 Correction: November 23, 2016, Wednesday\par \par \uc2 This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article on Oct. 23 about a new national understanding of sexual assault, apparently provoked by a recording in which Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2  brags about how his fame allows him to grope women, misidentified, using information from a Stanford historian, the century whose midpoint is regarded as the time when patriarchal attitudes toward sexual crimes began to change. Sexual assault and rape were viewed primarily as crimes against the honor of women's husbands and fathers until the mid-19th century -- not the mid-20th, according to the historian, Estelle B. Freedman.\par \par \uc2 Women protesting against Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2  and the Republican Party in front of \uc2 Trump\uc2  Tower in Manhattan on Wednesday.

\par\par \uc2 OPINION\par \uc2 Sunday Review Desk; SECTSR\par \b \uc2 The Republican Lion in Winter\b0\par\par\uc2 By EVAN THOMAS \par \uc2 1,278 \uc2 words\par \uc2 23 October 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 4\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 CORRECTION APPENDEDOn Oct. 26, 1967, \uc2 John McCain\uc2 's A-4 Skyhawk was shot down over North Vietnam. Over the next five and a half years, Lieutenant Commander McCain was tortured by North Vietnamese guards seeking to force him to confess his ''air piracy''; twice, he tried to commit suicide rather than give in. As a stunt intended to embarrass his father -- Adm. John McCain, commander of American forces in the Pacific -- his captors at the Hanoi Hilton offered to free the younger McCain. Rather than desert his mates, he refused.\par \par \uc2 Nearly 50 years later, Mr. McCain, during what will most likely be his last run for the Senate, faces another reproach to his core values, this time in the unlikely form of his party's presidential nominee, \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Like his party, Mr. McCain has been caught between his self-interest and his principles, between his instinct to survive and his instinct to sacrifice for the greater good. How the senator deals with an increasingly toxic \uc2 Trump\uc2  campaign will do much to determine how he's remembered -- and may well signal how the Republican Party goes about trying to pick up the pieces.\par \par \uc2 Mr. McCain was among Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's earliest targets. In July 2015, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  declared that Mr. McCain, who had chided him for vowing to deport all illegal immigrants, ''was not a war hero,'' then amended his remarks to absurdly state: ''He's a war hero because he was captured. I like people that weren't captured, O.K.?'' Mr. McCain, whose temper is well known, might have lashed back, but he mostly simmered.\par \par \uc2 Later, he chastised Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  for cozying up to President \uc2 Vladimir V. Putin\uc2  of Russia and for besmirching the Gold Star family of an Army captain, Humayun Khan. After \uc2 Mitt Romney\uc2  excoriated Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  as unqualified for office, Mr. McCain seconded his remarks from the Senate floor. Mr. McCain even declined to attend the Republican National Convention, in an obvious snub to his party's nominee.\par \par \uc2 At the same time, in May he endorsed Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  for president. ''I support the Republican Party, and the Republicans have chosen the nominee for the party,'' he said. At the time, Mr. McCain was locked in a primary fight against a right-wing opponent who was popular among \uc2 Trump\uc2  supporters, and Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's subsequent endorsement of Mr. McCain helped him survive the challenge.\par \par \uc2 More recently, Mr. McCain has soured on Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 ; the day after the ''Access Hollywood'' tape was released, he withdrew his endorsement. ''I have daughters, I have friends,'' he explained. After the debate Wednesday night, he gave Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  -- and all of us -- a needed civics lesson by reminding him that graciously accepting the voters' choice in a presidential race is ''the American way.'' Still, Mr. McCain seems to feel a need to tread lightly around Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 ''He is in the middle of a re-\uc2 election\uc2  race,'' explains an aide, ''and it's a fairly competitive one.'' (''Competitive'' is relative; he leads his Democratic opponent, Representative Ann Kirkpatrick, by double digits in voter surveys.) Still, by renouncing Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , he runs the risk of alienating \uc2 Trump\uc2  voters without necessarily winning over enough Democrats to cover the loss -- especially if \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , as seems likely, carries Arizona.\par \par \uc2 Mr. McCain's modulation is not just political; it's also personal. His rock-ribbed public image contrasts with a history of struggling with personal demons. ''I'm a man of many failings,'' he once told me. ''I make no bones about it. That's why I'm such a believer in redemption. I've done many, many wrong things in my life. The key is to try to improve.''\par \par \uc2 Mr. McCain once told a Navy psychiatrist that, as a teenager, he was a ''rebel without a cause.'' One of his high school nicknames was ''McNasty.'' Even today, some congressional colleagues call him ''Senator Hothead''; more than a few have received letters of apology from Mr. McCain after being told off by him, sometimes loudly and profanely.\par \par \uc2 That struggle between niceness and harshness was evident during Mr. McCain's 2008 run for president. That year, groups that were nominally independent from the Republican Party bought advertisements meant to (however subtly) stir a racist backlash against \uc2 Barack Obama\uc2 . Mr. McCain might have stood back and let them do his dirty work; instead he quietly, firmly let it be known he and his campaign wanted no such underhanded tactics. When a woman at a rally attacked Mr. Obama as an ''Arab,'' Mr. McCain responded, ''No, ma'am, no, ma'am, he's a decent, family-man citizen.''\par \par \uc2 This was the same McCain who, as he anxiously watched a nascent Tea Party movement take root in his party, chose \uc2 Sarah Palin\uc2  to be his running mate. In the process, he ended up sabotaging his own campaign; worse, Ms. Palin's know-nothing rants helped set the stage for Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 . (Does Mr. McCain regret his choice? ''McCain looks forward, not back,'' a friend of his told me.)\par \par \uc2 Mr. McCain has had a similarly complicated record in the Senate. He has shown an ability to reach across the aisle, working with Senator Edward Kennedy on the last serious congressional attempt at immigration reform. He even cooperated from time to time with Senator \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  (and in 2004, on a trip to Estonia, engaged her in a vodka-drinking contest). But he can be extremely, immoderately partisan. Just last week, he blurted on talk radio that if Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  is elected, he will try to block any Supreme Court nominee she sends to Congress. (A spokesman later tried to walk back this reckless vow.)\par \par \uc2 And yet, as a defeated presidential candidate in 2008, he showed grace and respect for democracy. ''This campaign was and will remain the great honor of my life,'' he said on \uc2 election\uc2  night, ''and my heart is filled with nothing but gratitude for the experience and to the American people for giving me a fair hearing before deciding that Senator Obama and my old friend \uc2 Joe Biden\uc2  should have the honor of leading us for the next four years.''\par \par \uc2 On his 23rd mission over North Vietnam, Captain McCain heard the beep signaling that an antiaircraft missile had locked on to his plane. He could have ''jinked'' -- aborted the mission -- to avoid the missile, but out of stubborn bravery, he flew straight on. He had just toggled the bomb-release switch when the enemy missile blew off the right wing of his plane.\par \par \uc2 With just weeks left in the campaign, Mr. McCain has the opportunity to to directly challenge Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  and use his still-lofty position in the Republican firmament to begin to rebuild his party. Or he might decide to play it safe, racking up a higher vote count and saving his fire for another day.\par \par \uc2 Mr. McCain is a survivor as well as a hero. Only he knows the true measure of his heart.\par \par \uc2 Follow The \uc2 New York Times\uc2  Opinion section on \uc2 Facebook\uc2  and \uc2 Twitter\uc2  (@NYTopinion), and sign up for the Opinion Today newsletter.\par \par \uc2 Correction: October 30, 2016, Sunday\par \par \uc2 This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An Opinion essay last Sunday about \uc2 John McCain\uc2  misstated his rank when he was a prisoner of war in Vietnam. He was a Navy lieutenant commander, not a captain, a rank he achieved later.\par \par \uc2 Evan Thomas is the author, most recently, of ''Being Nixon: A Man Divided.''\par \par \uc2 How John McCain deals with the \uc2 Trump\uc2  candidacy will shape how he's remembered.

Is \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  the Answer?\b0\par\par\uc2 By SUSAN CHIRA \par \uc2 1,969 \uc2 words\par \uc2 23 October 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 6\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 If \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  wins this \uc2 election\uc2  and becomes the first female president of the United States, American men may well be one of her most urgent problems.\par \par \uc2 Consider some startling statistics.\par \par \uc2 More than a fifth of American men -- about 20 million people -- between 20 and 65 had no paid work last year.\par \par \uc2 Seven million men between 25 and 55 are no longer even looking for work, twice as many black men as white.\par \par \uc2 There are 20 million men with felony records who are not in jail, with dim prospects of employment, and more of these are black men.\par \par \uc2 Half the men not in the labor force report they are in bad physical or mental health.\par \par \uc2 Men account for only 42 percent of college graduates, handicapping them in a job market that rewards higher levels of education.\par \par \uc2 Lawrence H. Summers\uc2 , the former Treasury secretary and now a professor of economics at Harvard, estimates that a third of men between 25 and 54 without college educations could be out of work by midcentury.\par \par \uc2 Well-paying jobs that don't demand a college degree have been shrinking for generations -- and technology is accelerating that trend. Driverless cars, for instance, could eliminate trucking as we know it, a refuge for many blue-collar men.\par \par \uc2 The crisis is not confined to the white men backing Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , who has commanding majorities among men without college educations. The challenge of masculinity in America extends beyond race and political party.\par \par \uc2 Economists and scholars have assembled a trove of disturbing data about the plight of men, even as they acknowledge that women's employment has stalled for the past 15 years as well.\par \par \uc2 Nicholas N. Eberstadt\uc2  of the \uc2 American Enterprise Institute\uc2  has released the latest compendium, ''Men Without Work.'' Drawing on multiple data sets, he sketches an unsettling portrait not just of male unemployment, but also of lives deeply alienated from civil society. The seven million men who are not even looking for work -- about 60 percent of whom do not have four-year college degrees -- spent an average of five and a half hours a day watching television or movies. Very few cared for children or other household members, or did housework. A third admitted to illegal drug use.\par \par \uc2 Many of Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's backers talk about losing out in the new economy, echoing the points the candidate makes on the campaign trail.\par \par \uc2 Joe Peterson and Al Paslow, 61 years old and friends since high school, waited for hours the other day to attend a \uc2 Trump\uc2  rally in Ambridge, Pa. -- a town named for the \uc2 American Bridge Company\uc2 . It was a resonant spot, in the heart of what was once a thriving steel and energy powerhouse. Mr. Paslow's mother grew up in Ambridge on the very street where the rally took place. Their family, friends and relatives all worked in the abundant steel mills in the Pittsburgh area -- Mr. Peterson's father as an electrician, Mr. Paslow's father as a blacksmith.\par \par \uc2 ''Now these mills are gone, replaced by stores, shops and offices that could have been placed almost anywhere,'' Mr. Paslow said. ''No industry here now; it's all been lost.''\par \par \uc2 The two friends most recently worked as independent contractors in the oil and gas industry, earning six-figure salaries. Mr. Peterson had a high school education; Mr. Paslow a college degree. Last year, they were both laid off -- no severance or unemployment, because they were not technically employees.\par \par \uc2 ''I worked for the oil industry, which is dead because of Hillary,'' Mr. Peterson said. Now, he said, he was ''considered nothing.'' He is worried about whether his son will find work; both friends fear that they may never get a job again.\par \par \uc2 The friends were thrilled that Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  promised at the rally to bring the oil and gas industry back on his very first day in office. ''Unbelievably, that was exactly what we wanted to hear,'' Mr. Paslow said. ''Our hearts were uplifted.''\par \par \uc2 More than economic loss, though, support for Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  appears to come from men who live in places where intergenerational mobility is low and who report worries about their finances, whatever their level of income, according to Jonathan Rothwell, a senior economist at Gallup who analyzed 106,000 interviews conducted over the past year.\par \par \uc2 Add to economic anxiety a spate of illness and disability. American men -- particularly men without a college degree -- are simply less healthy than women.\par \par \uc2 Alan B. Krueger, a professor of economics at Princeton, recently conducted a study of working-age men. ''I came away thinking our biggest social problem is men,'' he said.\par \par \uc2 A huge number are on painkillers, including 43.5 percent of men who have stopped looking for work. Both physical and emotional pain -- sadness, stress and dissatisfaction with their lives -- were particularly acute among men without college degrees, the unemployed and those not looking for work.\par \par \uc2 On several measures of health, men fare worse than women, and black men fare worse than white men. Black men die at higher rates than white men from AIDS, heart disease, cancer and homicide.\par \par \uc2 Yet the gaps are growing smaller by gender and race, and bigger by income and education. A man born in 1950, who is now in the lowest 10 percent of household earnings, can expect to live 14 fewer years than a man in the top 10 percent, according to a \uc2 Brookings Institution\uc2  study. Smoking, the largest preventable cause of death, is more prevalent among lower-income and less-well-educated people, and accounted for a third to a fifth of the gap in life expectancy between men with college degrees and men with high school diplomas, according to Andrew Fenelon of the \uc2 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\uc2  and Jessica Ho of \uc2 Duke University\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Poor health makes it harder to work. Mr. Krueger found that 11.5 percent of men who were not employed cited illness and disability as a factor. Mr. Eberstadt's analysis found that nearly two-thirds of American households where men were not in the labor force reported receiving money from at least one disability program in 2013.\par \par \uc2 American men are also far more likely than women to be in jail or to be convicted of a felony, compounding the difficulty of finding work. The government keeps almost no data on the 20 million men who are not in prison but have felony convictions. Mr. Eberstadt estimates that for men with a criminal record between 45 and 54, the odds of being out of the work force are 35 percent for white males and 40 percent for black males.\par \par \uc2 A segment of American men feel under cultural as well as economic assault.\par \par \uc2 Andrew J. Cherlin, a sociologist at \uc2 Johns Hopkins University\uc2  and the author of ''Labor's Love Lost: Rise and Fall of the Working Class Family in America,'' directly links economic upheaval to the loss of masculinity. ''It's much more difficult now to say, I'm a real man,'' he said. ''A real man earns enough so his wife doesn't have to work.''\par \par \uc2 Most economists, though, don't believe it's possible to go back to the days when manufacturing was king -- and few women would want to give up economic or societal power, either. So what could help American men?\par \par \uc2 Many of the policies aimed at spurring economic growth and supporting low-wage workers would assist American men without college educations in particular.\par \par \uc2 In the short term, liberal economists and even some conservative ones back an idea that Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  has said she would push in her first 100 days -- a $275 billion infrastructure jobs plan, which could provide at least temporary employment to a key segment of those hurting the most: blue-collar men.\par \par \uc2 Liberal economists tend to coalesce around other solutions, such as raising the minimum wage and expanding eligibility for the earned-income tax credit, a proven way to reduce poverty. Mr. Summers is one of many who would push the \uc2 Federal Reserve\uc2  to continue stimulating the economy to boost employment, rather than focusing on curbing inflation. He also argues for government subsidies to bolster the wages of less-skilled employees.\par \par \uc2 Wage insurance could address the plight of men like Mr. Paslow; as Mr. Krueger explains it, payroll taxes could be used to make up some of the gap between the higher hourly wages earned in manufacturing and the lower wages more common in the service industry.\par \par \uc2 Liberal and conservative economists agree on the failings of the education system and urge more focus on the school-to-work transition, since so many men without a college education are flailing.\par \par \uc2 Apprenticeship systems and expanded access to community colleges -- both ideas backed by President Obama -- could help train workers for high-demand jobs without requiring four-year colleges, Mr. Cherlin said. But conservatives worry about the cost of subsidizing community colleges.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Summers would like to see more government investment in areas with bad school systems, but conservatives prize local control.\par \par \uc2 Re-examining the effects of mass incarceration -- on black men in particular -- and reconsidering mandatory sentences have attracted bipartisan support, though such efforts stalled in Congress. Mr. Summers calls for improving incarceration-to-work programs.\par \par \uc2 While debate continues to rage about Obamacare, Mr. Krueger is convinced that expanding health insurance could provide American men with more preventive treatments and promote healthier lifestyles.\par \par \uc2 But in the long term, Isabel V. Sawhill and Richard V. Reeves, senior fellows at the \uc2 Brookings Institution\uc2 , argue that men must resign themselves to working in ''pink collar jobs'' -- those known by the acronym HEAL, for health, education, administration and literacy.\par \par \uc2 Economically, ''women have adjusted better than men,'' Ms. Sawhill said. ''They're the ones who are winning.'' Women dominate the (often lower-paying) service jobs that are the backbone of the new economy. Men make up just 20 percent of elementary and middle-school teachers, 9 percent of nurses, 16 percent of personal aides and 6 percent of personal assistants, Ms. Sawhill and Mr. Reeves noted.\par \par \uc2 Succeeding in the new economy and culture may well require rethinking conventional ideas about masculinity. Mr. Cherlin bemoans men's ''continued reluctance to take jobs they think are beneath the dignity of real men.''\par \par \uc2 From the conservative end of the spectrum, Mr. Eberstadt flags the disability system. He'd like to see it redefined as a ''work first'' program, much like welfare reform under \uc2 Bill \uc2 Clinton\uc2 . He cites a Swedish program that ties disability benefits to showing up for job training and job placement.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Eberstadt would also like to intensify social pressure on the cadre of men who have stopped looking for work. ''Why haven't we had the same sort of conversation about stigmatizing or shaming unworking men that we had 20 years ago about mothers on welfare?'' he said. ''They were not idle; they had little kids.''\par \par \uc2 If she wins, focusing on American men could pay off for Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 . She could shore up support with traditional Democratic voters such as African-American men. Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  and the Democratic Party have lost considerable ground with a constituency they used to own, blue-collar men. Angry white men are not likely to trust Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , Beltway politicians or the political system. But they will need their help.\par \par \uc2 Follow The \uc2 New York Times\uc2  Opinion section on \uc2 Facebook\uc2  and \uc2 Twitter\uc2  (@NYTOpinion), and sign up for the Opinion Today newsletter.\par \par \uc2 Susan Chira (@susanchira) is a senior correspondent and editor on gender issues for The New York Times.

\par\par \uc2 Style Desk; SECTST\par \b \uc2 An \uc2 Election\uc2  Sends America to the Couch\b0\par\par\uc2 By LESLEY ALDERMAN \par \uc2 1,075 \uc2 words\par \uc2 23 October 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 1\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 It has been described as one of the most contentious, tawdry and angry presidential elections in history. And it's taking a toll on our mental health.\par \par \uc2 ''I've been in private practice for 30 years, and I have never seen patients have such strong reactions to an \uc2 election\uc2 ,'' said Sue Elias, a licensed clinical social worker in Manhattan.\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 American Psychological Association\uc2  says that 52 percent of American adults are coping with high levels of stress brought on by the \uc2 election\uc2 , according to national \uc2 Harris Poll\uc2  survey data released last week. Therapists around the country said in interviews that patients are coming to appointments citing their fears, anger and anxiety about the \uc2 election\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Both poll data and anecdotal reports show that the high levels of \uc2 election\uc2  anxiety are affecting both Republicans and Democrats equally.\par \par \uc2 ''We're seeing that it doesn't matter whether you're registered as a Democrat or Republican -- U.S. adults say they are experiencing significant stress from the current \uc2 election\uc2 ,'' Lynn Bufka, the association's associate executive director for practice research and policy, said in a statement.\par \par \uc2 According to the \uc2 American Psychological Association\uc2 , 55 percent of Democrats and 59 percent of Republicans -- a statistical tie -- say the \uc2 election\uc2  is a major source of stress. ''People seem to be getting more worried every day,'' said Elaine Ducharme, a licensed clinical psychologist in Glastonbury, Conn.\par \par \uc2 While every \uc2 election\uc2  provokes some level of anxiety as we watch our preferred candidate move up or down in the polls, the battle between \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  and \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2  appears to be taking a greater toll. After speaking with mental health experts across the country about what they are hearing from their patients, a common theme has emerged: This \uc2 election\uc2  has made people feel less safe.\par \par \uc2 Therapists say that some of the issues that have emerged in this \uc2 election\uc2  -- national security, terrorism, hacking threats, gun rights and sexual assault -- play into some of our deepest fears and anxieties. Issues of secrecy -- Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's emails and Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's tax returns -- and allegations of conspiracies and a rigged \uc2 election\uc2 , have compounded some patients' feelings of distrust.\par \par \uc2 ''People are wondering, how can I feel safe? Who will take care of us?'' said Dr. Robert Bright, a psychiatrist at the \uc2 Mayo Clinic\uc2  in Phoenix. ''Everyone I talk to is very concerned about this \uc2 election\uc2 .''\par \par \uc2 What's striking, say therapists, is how deep the fears go on both sides.\par \par \uc2 ''About one-third of my patients talk about the \uc2 election\uc2  -- and both the conservatives and the progressives are affected,'' said David Rogers, a clinical psychologist in Hershey, Pa. ''The campaign is arousing fears about the unknown. Both sides are aroused, because the results feel so consequential. It's like when Lincoln was running against Douglas and Jefferson was up against Adams.''\par \par \uc2 Conservative voters are concerned about gun rights, and fear that Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  will appoint Supreme Court justices who will chip away at the Second Amendment. And in a world that feels increasingly unsafe, guns give some Americans a sense of security and control. On the other side, with Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  questioning the fairness of the \uc2 election\uc2 , and one Milwaukee sheriff calling for ''pitchforks and torches,'' some fear that the aftermath of the \uc2 election\uc2  could bring violence.\par \par \uc2 And the unusual nature of the \uc2 election\uc2 , with Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  pushing the limits of acceptable behavior in politics, is creating problems for people who struggle with mental health issues.\par \par \uc2 ''Boundaries are an important part of mental health,'' said Dr. Ducharme. ''In order to feel safe, people need to have a sense that there are rules and norms. In this \uc2 election\uc2  our leaders appear to be out of control.''\par \par \uc2 Strong feelings about the candidates are causing not only rifts between Democrats and Republicans, but also among families and friends. Ms. Elias has patients who are avoiding friends and family members with whom they disagree.\par \par \uc2 ''It's like the Civil War,'' said Ms. Elias. ''I have never seen an \uc2 election\uc2  cause this level of conflict.''\par \par \uc2 ''People are having a hard time seeing the perspectives of the opposite side,'' said David Palmiter, a clinical psychologist in Clarks Summit, Pa.\par \par \uc2 For women, particularly those who have been victims of sexual assault, the \uc2 election\uc2  has triggered painful memories. Ms. Elias said that after the second debate, ''many of my female patients came in and wanted to talk about \uc2 Trump\uc2 .'' She said patients felt that Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  seemed to stalk Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  and invade her space. Some patients needed to process incidents in which they had felt belittled or harassed by men in their lives.\par \par \uc2 ''Women said their hearts were racing during the debate, they were that triggered,'' Ms. Elias said. ''Some came in complaining of having had nightmares.''\par \par \uc2 It doesn't help any of us that the news is relentless. According to the A.P.A. poll, stress was highest among those Americans who use social media.\par \par \uc2 ''I see a lot of hypervigilance,'' Dr. Bright said. ''I hear of people checking fivethirtyeight.com three and four times a day to see if the numbers have shifted,'' he said. ''It's exhausting to live with that level of constant anxiety. You carry that tension in your body and it wears you out.''\par \par \uc2 Therapists say they offer their patients coping techniques. Rather than tell yourself to stop worrying, which rarely works, Dr. Bright suggests setting aside time to worry, like when you get home from work or during your lunch break. ''This is a behavioral technique called thought stopping, and it can be very effective,'' he said.\par \par \uc2 The A.P.A. tells patients to ''read just enough to stay informed.'' Take breaks from social media to go for a walk, spend time with friends or do other things you enjoy. Be aware of how much \uc2 election\uc2  talk is dominating conversations with friends and family, and change the subject. Avoid politics altogether if a conversation is likely to escalate to conflict.\par \par \uc2 Dr. Ducharme said she tells her patients to limit exposure to the news and to find distractions.\par \par \uc2 ''I tell my patients to catch up on the news for 20 minutes, then turn to something more satisfying,'' she said. ''My husband and I have watched more comedies on \uc2 Netflix\uc2  than ever.''\par \par \uc2 It's been a trying race for Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2  and Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 .

\par\par \uc2 Money and Business/Financial Desk; SECTBU\par \b \uc2 Teneo's Constellation of Influencers\b0\par\par\uc2 By JULIE CRESWELL and J. DAVID GOODMAN \par \uc2 2,810 \uc2 words\par \uc2 23 October 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 1\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Whether participating in glittery dinners with heads of state, or t\u234\'00\'EAte-\u224\'00\'E0-t\u234\'00\'EAtes in the Oval Office, \uc2 Andrew Liveris\uc2 , the chief executive of Dow Chemical, has regularly visited the White House.\par \par \uc2 He served as co-chairman of President \uc2 Obama\uc2 's Advanced Manufacturing Partnership. He stood beside the president onstage at events.\par \par \uc2 Many of these Washington appearances by Mr. Liveris -- which have totaled more than two dozen since 2009 -- were arranged with the help of Teneo, an advisory firm with close ties to the Democratic establishment. Dow is Teneo's biggest and most lucrative account, paying millions of dollars a year in fees, according to a 2014 lawsuit filed against Dow and interviews with two Teneo employees.\par \par \uc2 Teneo bills itself as the chief executive's best friend. Its pitch is that, with Teneo's help, C.E.O.s can become not just business leaders but ''thought leaders and global ambassadors,'' according to its website.\par \par \uc2 To achieve that, Teneo hires influential political and corporate figures to advise clients. Last month it added its latest superstar, William J. Bratton, the former top police official in New York, Los Angeles and Boston, who will head a new security unit.\par \par \uc2 Other prominent employees have included former President \uc2 Bill \uc2 Clinton\uc2  and Huma Abedin, who, starting in 2012, briefly worked at Teneo while employed at the State Department under Secretary \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 . At the same time, Ms. Abedin held a paid position at the \uc2 Clinton\uc2  Foundation\uc2 , the family-founded charitable organization. Last year, Teneo declined to answer questions from the Senate Judiciary Committee regarding Ms. Abedin's employment.\par \par \uc2 Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  is now, of course, the Democratic candidate for president. And in an \uc2 election\uc2  year defined by voters' anti-insider sentiment, Teneo -- a firm whose business plan is premised on putting its clients, not the firm itself, in the limelight -- has found itself in the public eye for its relationship with the Clintons.\par \par \uc2 Interviews with more than a dozen current and former Teneo employees -- most of whom asked not to be identified because of confidentiality agreements or concerns about endangering their relationships with Teneo -- shed light on the inner workings of power and politics in the nation's capital and beyond.\par \par \uc2 One of Teneo's three founders, \uc2 Declan Kelly\uc2 , was a fund-raiser for Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  and also served as an envoy to Northern Ireland during her tenure as secretary of state. A second founder, Douglas J. Band, was a close adviser to Mr. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  during and after his presidency.\par \par \uc2 More recently, in mid-October, emails released by \uc2 WikiLeaks\uc2  involving Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's campaign chairman, \uc2 John D. Podesta\uc2 , included several written in late 2011 by \uc2 Chelsea \uc2 Clinton\uc2  to Mr. Podesta, in which she accuses Teneo employees of ''hustling'' for business at the annual \uc2 Clinton\uc2  Global Initiative, the annual symposium that brings together politicians, business chiefs and heads of nonprofit organizations to discuss and debate global issues. \uc2 Chelsea \uc2 Clinton\uc2  also accused Teneo employees of using her father's name to set up meetings with London lawmakers for Teneo clients.\par \par \uc2 At that time, \uc2 Chelsea \uc2 Clinton\uc2  and Mr. Podesta were involved in an effort to formalize the relationships between Mr. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's personal office, the \uc2 Clinton\uc2  Foundation\uc2  and other initiatives to, among other things, avoid any perceptions of conflict of interest.\par \par \uc2 In the email chain, Mr. Band responds to Mr. Podesta denying any connection between Teneo and the Clintons. In one note, he writes that \uc2 Chelsea \uc2 Clinton\uc2  is ''acting like a spoiled brat kid who has nothing else to do but create issues.''\par \par \uc2 Teneo, through a spokesman, called \uc2 Chelsea \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's accusations in the emails ''completely false.'' A spokeswoman for \uc2 Chelsea \uc2 Clinton\uc2  did not respond to an email seeking comment. A spokesman for \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's campaign, which Mr. Podesta is running, said it would not authenticate any of the hacked Podesta emails.\par \par \uc2 Hacked emails reflect only one challenge facing the fast-growing firm. Within Teneo, some have expressed concern that if Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  is elected in November, the firm may find it harder to arrange White House meetings for its clients, perhaps because of sensitivities about perceived conflicts of interest.\par \par \uc2 In an effort to become more of a one-stop shop well beyond Washington power circles, Teneo has been rapidly expanding to include investment banking services, executive recruiting and now risk assessment and response (tapping Mr. Bratton's expertise). ''I'm part of that growth plan,'' Mr. Bratton said in an interview.\par \par \uc2 In fact, the growth has been so fast that last year employees made a tongue-in-cheek video in which they tried, and sometimes failed, to name all 12 of Teneo's divisions.\par \par \uc2 But the firm's rapid growth and \uc2 election\uc2 -year tumult have fed speculation over how soon its private equity investors may want to cash out. In mid-September, an article in The Wall Street Journal suggested that a public offering of stock was on the horizon, an idea the private equity owners vigorously disputed.\par \par \uc2 ''We and the company are under no pressure to do anything with regard to the company's future, and any suggestion to the contrary is completely false and baseless,'' \uc2 BC Partners\uc2 , the private equity owners, said in a statement.\par \par \uc2 In an emailed response to questions, Teneo said it did not sell access to its corporate clients and that ''any suggestion otherwise is false and misleading.'' The statement said, ''The firm is fortunate to represent many of the largest and best known companies in the world,'' and emphasized that ''Teneo operates at all times to the highest ethical and professional standards.''\par \par \uc2 Rebecca Bentley, a spokeswoman for Teneo's major client, Dow, said that the firm's fees had never totaled more than $1 million a month and that Teneo provided a range of advisory services around the world, including investor relations and digital and crisis communications. As for Mr. Liveris's visits to the White House, she said that not all of them had been arranged by Teneo.\par \par \uc2 A White House official said in a statement ''the Office of Public Engagement routinely meets with hundreds of private sector stakeholders'' on a monthly basis.\par \par \uc2 But former employees said what made Teneo special was that it offered a constellation of influencers, such as Mr. Bratton and others, to counsel its clients, make connections with their contact lists or simply help amplify a C.E.O.'s stature by attending a dinner or event.\par \par \uc2 Ed Rollins\uc2 , a veteran Republican strategist who ran Ronald Reagan's 1984 re-\uc2 election\uc2  campaign and who was a consultant with Teneo until this year, said, ''The ability to bring business and political leaders together to meet the C.E.O.s was all part of the selling point.''\par \par \uc2 Insiders and Email\par \par \uc2 The office of Mr. Band, a Teneo co-founder and longtime aide to Mr. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , offers a reminder of the firm's roots. One photograph pictures Mr. Band, Mr. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  and President \uc2 Obama\uc2  playing golf. Another shows Mr. Band and Mr. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  in 2009 after they negotiated the release of journalists from North Korea.\par \par \uc2 Teneo was formed in June 2011, when Mr. Kelly, the former fund-raiser for Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , joined with Mr. Band and Paul Keary, who worked with Mr. Kelly at another communications firm. Mr. Keary and Mr. Kelly are members of a rock band at Teneo, Insane Asylum, which performs Rolling Stones covers, former employees say.\par \par \uc2 Early on, Mr. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  was named to Teneo's advisory board. A search of \uc2 LinkedIn\uc2  profiles shows that a number of former aides to the Clintons or employees of the \uc2 Clinton\uc2  Foundation\uc2  have worked there or acted as consultants, including Justin Cooper, an assistant to President \uc2 Clinton\uc2  who helped set up the family's private email server.\par \par \uc2 One employee who has faced particular scrutiny is Ms. Abedin, who worked as a consultant at Teneo in late 2012 while simultaneously working as Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's aide in the State Department. Late last year, a letter sent to Teneo by Senator \uc2 Charles E. Grassley\uc2 , Republican of Iowa, chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, asked for details of Ms. Abedin's agreement and whether the arrangement had resulted in undue influence on Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's diplomatic work.\par \par \uc2 Teneo declined to provide the information and said it had provided the necessary details, including Ms. Abedin's contract, to the State Department Office of the Inspector General, which was conducting its own inquiry into Ms. Abedin's work status. ''Out of respect for the independence and integrity of that review, I respectfully refer your office to them for any other questions you might have,'' Mr. Kelly wrote last October.\par \par \uc2 The State Department Office of the Inspector General declined to comment on the inquiry.\par \par \uc2 About the same time, Teneo changed its retention policy. In a June 2015 email to staff members that was reviewed by The \uc2 New York Times\uc2 , Teneo said that nearly all emails older than one year would be ''automatically removed'' from its system. The firm cited cybersecurity concerns.\par \par \uc2 When asked about the new email retention policy, Teneo said in a statement that it was ''well aware of its obligations under the law in terms of retention and preservation of electronic communications and any insinuation that it has not met these obligations is totally false.''\par \par \uc2 Beyond the Clintons\par \par \uc2 While several former employees said Teneo's connections to the \uc2 Clinton\uc2  family had given the firm its jump start, others noted that there were prominent employees who had nothing to do with the Clintons. Besides Mr. Rollins, Teneo also has within its ranks a former Democratic senator from Maine, George J. Mitchell, and \uc2 Harvey Pitt\uc2 , a former chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission appointed by President George W. Bush.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Mitchell, a partner at the law firm \uc2 DLA Piper\uc2 , spoke about his work in an interview. ''It's not a major part of my time,'' he said, adding that he had spoken at Teneo's annual event and at functions in London and Toronto. He said he had also reviewed the practices of two multinational corporations, advising their chief executives and boards on how ''to improve their risk assessment procedures and legal compliance.''\par \par \uc2 Beyond the ties to the Clintons, longstanding relationships with crucial clients -- \uc2 Dow Chemical\uc2  and \uc2 Coca-Cola\uc2  (a vintage Coke machine stands in Teneo's lobby) -- also provided a big push. Teneo's growth over the last five years has been remarkable, and it now has 550 employees in 14 offices around the world.\par \par \uc2 Teneo has acted as counsel to many of the world's superstar chief executives, including Virginia M. Rometty of \uc2 IBM\uc2 , \uc2 Ursula Burns\uc2  of \uc2 Xerox\uc2 , \uc2 Sergio Ermotti\uc2  and \uc2 Robert McCann\uc2  of \uc2 UBS\uc2 , and \uc2 Klaus Kleinfeld\uc2  of \uc2 Alcoa\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Its fees can be high compared with those of its peers, ranging from $150,000 to more than $1 million a month. Teneo helped \uc2 Dow Chemical\uc2  defend itself against various barrages from the activist investor \uc2 Daniel S. Loeb\uc2  and respond to negative reports over a lawsuit filed by an internal fraud investigator who claimed she was fired after alleging fraudulent expenses by Mr. Liveris. The suit was settled, and a Dow spokeswoman denied any wrongdoing.\par \par \uc2 Teneo also helped shape \uc2 McDonald's\uc2  campaign against raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour, and it assisted Boston in the city's unsuccessful bid to host the 2024 Summer Olympics.\par \par \uc2 Teneo frames its offerings to C.E.O.s like this, according to several former employees: You can't trust your board of directors, who could fire you. You can't trust your lieutenants, who want your job. Which is why you need Teneo.\par \par \uc2 Some pitches also included what three former Teneo employees called the fear factor approach. A team of Teneo internal data analysts would provide a prospective client with a list of companies at risk of attack from activist investors, highlighting the risks to that person's company.\par \par \uc2 Once an executive is signed as a client -- and depending on his or her needs -- Teneo will occasionally organize what it describes as a salon event for the client's benefit. Typically casual get-togethers, these dinners have been held in a private room at the ''21'' Club or the restaurant Marea in New York, or at private residences.\par \par \uc2 For instance, \uc2 Heather Bresch\uc2 , the chief executive of the pharmaceutical company Mylan, was given two salons by Teneo in 2011 -- one in a New York City apartment and a second at a private home in Washington that attracted a mix of media, finance and political elite. Then, in 2012, a Teneo employee and Ms. Bresch met with President \uc2 Obama\uc2 's senior adviser Valerie Jarrett at the White House, according to White House records.\par \par \uc2 This year Ms. Bresch was thrust into the spotlight after Mylan increased the price of its EpiPen, a lifesaving allergy treatment, sixfold. A Mylan spokeswoman, \uc2 Nina Devlin\uc2 , confirmed that the company had been a client of Teneo, saying the relationship ended in 2012. She declined to address specific questions about the dinners.\par \par \uc2 In Washington, Teneo salons -- often home-cooked dinners that occasionally include homemade ice cream -- are sometimes held in the home of \uc2 Margaret Carlson\uc2 , a columnist for Bloomberg View. Guests have included United States Senators Kirsten Gillibrand, Democrat of New York, and Joe Manchin, Democrat of West Virginia, according to several former Teneo employees.\par \par \uc2 Social interactions have long been a lubricant of both politics and business. However, some former Teneo employees said they felt it was not made clear to participants that the salons were being held on behalf of Teneo or its corporate clients.\par \par \uc2 ''I don't think they made it to be a sponsorship of Teneo,'' said Mr. Rollins, the former Teneo senior adviser. ''Margaret would do the invite.''\par \par \uc2 In a statement, Teneo said Mr. Rollins had been terminated for ''egregiously breaching'' his employment contract, adding that his comments on salon dinners or anything else relating to Teneo were ''categorically false, uninformed and made with malicious personal intent.''\par \par \uc2 Mr. Rollins denied that he had been fired. He said Mr. Kelly was upset when he learned that Mr. Rollins had taken a job at a different communications firm this year. (Mr. Rollins is also the chairman of a super PAC for the Republican presidential nominee, \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2 .)\par \par \uc2 ''He came in, got furious,'' Mr. Rollins said. ''From his perspective, I was his token Republican. He saw it as a defection,'' Mr. Rollins said, adding, ''It was not a comfortable place to be for a Republican.''\par \par \uc2 Still, spokesmen for Senator Gillibrand and Senator Manchin said the lawmakers had been unaware that any dinners they attended at the home of Ms. Carlson were connected to Teneo. Jonathan Kott, the spokesman for Mr. Manchin, said, ''He doesn't know what Teneo is.''\par \par \uc2 In a statement, Teneo said the salon dinners were an ''extremely small part'' of its operations and that they were ''information thought leadership events'' that were typically attended by heads of leading think tanks and nonprofit organizations, public officials and members of the media, including journalists from The \uc2 New York Times\uc2 . An individual inside the firm also said that all appropriate disclosures to participants were made.\par \par \uc2 Strict laws govern the activities of registered lobbyists in the American political system. Teneo has no registered lobbyists in its ranks and, in its statement, denied that any lobbying occurred at the salons.\par \par \uc2 Ms. Carlson declined to comment for this article or to respond to questions about whether she was paid by Teneo or reimbursed for the costs associated with the salons. Teneo declined to comment on whether there was payment or remuneration for the parties.\par \par \uc2 Still, individuals inside Teneo said the salons were valuable to the participants. Often they involve eight to 12 people, said \uc2 Gen. Raymond T. Odierno\uc2 , who became a senior adviser to Teneo in December after retiring as the Army's chief of staff last year. ''They're always very casual, close, interesting conversations that you're able to have,'' he said.\par \par \uc2 Teneo, an advisory firm with roots in the Democratic Party establishment, was founded in 2011 by, from left, Paul Keary, Declan Kelly and Douglas J. Band. (BU1); Prominent people who have worked for or consulted with Teneo include, (clockwise, from top left) Tony Blair, former prime minister of Britain; Justin Cooper, former aide to President Bill \uc2 Clinton\uc2 ; Ed Rollins, Republican strategist; Mr. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 ; Huma Abedin, aide to Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 ; and Thomas Shea, former chief of staff to former Gov. Jon Corzine of New Jersey.; Teneo also counts among its ranks, below from top: William J. Bratton, former police commissioner of New York; Harvey Pitt, former chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission; William Hague, former foreign secretary of Britain: George J. Mitchell, former United States Senator from Maine and a former special envoy to the Middle East; Brian O'Driscoll, former rugby player; and James Hoge, former editor of Foreign Affairs.

GABRIEL and SETH STEPHENS- DAVIDOWITZ \par \uc2 1,368 \uc2 words\par \uc2 23 October 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 2\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Are voters misleading pollsters? Are there hidden \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  supporters who could throw the \uc2 election\uc2  his way?\par \par \uc2 Over the past few years, we have both become interested in how data from the internet, particularly \uc2 Google\uc2  searches, might be used to predict events. People also tell \uc2 Google\uc2  things -- a lot of things -- that they may not admit to others. So can we use \uc2 Google\uc2  searches to predict whom voters will support in this \uc2 election\uc2 ? It is not as simple as we'd hoped.\par \par \uc2 One indicator of support might be how frequently people search for a candidate. There is some evidence that if they search for you, they will vote for you. In primary elections, \uc2 Google\uc2  search volume for a candidate in a state has predicted electoral outcomes. It is also true that in each of the past three general elections, the candidate with the most \uc2 Google\uc2  searches -- George W. Bush in 2004 and Barack Obama in 2008 and 2012 -- received the most votes.\par \par \uc2 This time around, nationwide, for every \uc2 Google\uc2  search about \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , there are two for Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 . Does this mean that there is widespread support for Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  that is being missed by pollsters and will carry him to a commanding victory? Highly doubtful.\par \par \uc2 Breaking down these searches by state yields a seemingly implausible electoral map. If Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  wins every state and has his biggest margins of victory in Vermont and California, we can all ignore polls and simply look at \uc2 Google\uc2  search volumes to predict future elections.\par \par \uc2 The high search volume for Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  is more likely evidence that he elicits strong reactions, which is hardly news. Many who plan to vote for Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  are anxiously searching the web for information about Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's chances.\par \par \uc2 While voters occasionally tell \uc2 Google\uc2  exactly how they feel -- searches like ''I love \uc2 Trump\uc2 '' or ''I hate \uc2 Clinton\uc2 '' -- these searches are too rare to be used to predict electoral outcomes.\par \par \uc2 One state that has a huge number of negative \uc2 Trump\uc2  searches is Alabama, a deeply red state that will almost certainly support Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 . We suspect that the high negative search rate may be driven by African-American voters, who may feel particular animosity toward Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 . But this group is not large enough to tip Alabama into the Democratic column.\par \par \uc2 There are two indicators that may contain information about the \uc2 election\uc2  that polls could be missing.\par \par \uc2 The first: \uc2 Google\uc2  searches related to information about voting. Every October of a presidential \uc2 election\uc2  year, hundreds of thousands of Americans enter terms like ''how to vote'' or ''where to vote.'' And the volume of these searches predicts where turnout will be high. This is valuable information since research suggests that more than half of nonvoters falsely tell pollsters they are going to vote.\par \par \uc2 To obtain clues about the number and composition of likely voters, we can compare city-level demographics to city-level search volumes. The main insight from \uc2 Google\uc2  searches this year is that African-American turnout may be down in 2016. There are significantly fewer searches for voting information in cities with large black populations than there were in 2012 and 2008.\par \par \uc2 This suggests that even though African-Americans overwhelmingly disapprove of Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , they will turn out at lower rates to oppose him than they did to support President Obama. This could mean that Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  will do a bit better than expected in contested states with substantial black populations, like Ohio and Florida.\par \par \uc2 Google\uc2  searches for voting information can also be used to test one hypothesis for how Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  might win. David N. Wasserman, an elections analyst at The Cook Political Report, has found that there were 47 million eligible white voters without a college degree who did not vote in 2012.\par \par \uc2 Might a significant number of these Americans be excited enough by Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's candidacy to vote in this \uc2 election\uc2 ? Doubtful. According to \uc2 Google\uc2  searches, there is no increased interest in information about voting in cities with low levels of education.\par \par \uc2 There is another indicator in \uc2 Google\uc2  searches that may contain meaningful information. A large percentage of \uc2 election\uc2 -related searches contain queries with both candidates' names. Some people search for ''\uc2 Trump Clinton\uc2  polls.'' Others look for highlights from the ''\uc2 Clinton Trump\uc2  debate.'' In fact, 12 percent of search queries with ''\uc2 Trump\uc2 '' also include the word ''\uc2 Clinton\uc2 .'' More than one-quarter of search queries with ''\uc2 Clinton\uc2 '' also include the word ''\uc2 Trump\uc2 .''\par \par \uc2 We have found that these seemingly neutral searches may actually give us some clues to which candidate a person supports.\par \par \uc2 How? The order in which the candidates appear. Our research suggests that a person is significantly more likely to put the candidate they support first in a search that includes both candidates' names.\par \par \uc2 In the previous three elections, the candidate who appeared first in more searches received the most votes. More interesting, the order the candidates were searched was predictive of which way a particular state would go.\par \par \uc2 In short, we observed a strong, statistically significant relationship between the order in which the candidates appeared in \uc2 Google\uc2  searches in that state and the number of votes the candidate received in that state. This relationship has become stronger as \uc2 Google\uc2  search data has gotten richer.\par \par \uc2 The order in which candidates are searched also seems to contain information that the polls can miss. In 2012, Nate Silver, the founder of the website FiveThirtyEight, accurately predicted the result in all 50 states. However, we found that in states that listed \uc2 Mitt Romney\uc2  before Mr. Obama in searches most frequently, Mr. Romney actually did better than Mr. Silver predicted. In states that most frequently listed Mr. Obama before Mr. Romney, Mr. Obama did better than Mr. Silver predicted.\par \par \uc2 While further analysis is required, data about search order could prove a meaningful supplement to polling data. This indicator could contain information that polls miss because voters are either lying to themselves or uncomfortable revealing their true preferences to pollsters. Perhaps if they claimed that they were undecided in 2012, but were consistently searching for ''Romney Obama polls,'' ''Romney Obama debate'' and ''Romney Obama \uc2 election\uc2 ,'' they were really planning to vote for Mr. Romney all along.\par \par \uc2 So what does search order tell us about 2016? Well, again, we confront the problem of the unusual nature of Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's campaign. Nationwide, there are more searches that include ''\uc2 Trump\uc2 '' before ''\uc2 Clinton\uc2 .'' This could be evidence that Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  is doing better than the polls project, although it seems likely that Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  is such a dominant and divisive figure in the American psyche that even some \uc2 Clinton\uc2  supporters think of this as the ''\uc2 Trump\uc2 -\uc2 Clinton election\uc2 .''\par \par \uc2 The data is clearly not perfect. It is what economists call noisy data. But generally speaking, the states in which the highest percentage of searches put ''\uc2 Trump\uc2 '' first are those where Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  seems to be performing better. Those states in which ''\uc2 Trump\uc2 '' comes first in search queries least often are those that are most supportive of Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 And, as in 2012, this indicator may have state-level information that polls are missing. If so, we would suspect that Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  might outperform his polls in Iowa and Nevada, for example.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  is such an unusual candidate that he makes it difficult to interpret any data, but there are a couple of indicators that Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  may be doing better than polls suggest in some states. If you're a \uc2 Clinton\uc2  supporter in a swing state worried about the prospect of a \uc2 Trump\uc2  presidency, now is not the time to sit back and relax.\par \par \uc2 Follow The \uc2 New York Times\uc2  Opinion section on \uc2 Facebook\uc2  and \uc2 Twitter\uc2  (@NYTopinion), and sign up for the Opinion Today newsletter.\par \par \uc2 Stuart A.

\par\par \uc2 Metropolitan Desk; SECTMB\par \b \uc2 Indie Rock Veterans at Age 14\b0\par\par\uc2 By LAURA BARCELLA \par \uc2 1,522 \uc2 words\par \uc2 23 October 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 1\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 ''Democracy's as good as dead, don't let them get inside your head!'' wailed Willow Bennison, singer and guitarist for the band Harsh Crowd.\par \par \uc2 Behind her, the three other members of the group thrashed away animatedly onstage at South Street Seaport. It was a beautiful autumn Saturday afternoon, and several dozen onlookers had stopped to watch, including a 20-something hipster in black leather and dark sunglasses, four exuberantly leaping little girls and an older man who had climbed out of his seated walker to dance.\par \par \uc2 The girls in the band carried themselves with an unusual confidence. All four are 14-year-old native New Yorkers, but their burgeoning feminist pop-punk has already drawn attention far beyond the free show at the Taste of the Seaport Festival where they were performing on this occasion. They have been refining their sound for more than three years, appearing at the kind of New York venues likely to intimidate much more established artists: SummerStage, Joe's Pub, Madison Square Garden. They released their first EP, ''Don't Ask Me,'' in September 2015; their new EP, ''Better,'' is due out later this year.\par \par \uc2 [Video: Harsh Crowd "Four Walls" Watch on \uc2 YouTube\uc2 .]\par \par \uc2 After the band finished its set, Willow's giddy mother, Emmy Gay, wearing a black Harsh Crowd T-shirt, hugged her daughter, raving about the band's soaring cover of Radiohead's ''Creep,'' a tough song to pull off. Willow rolled her eyes slightly, and her bandmates -- Dea Brogaard-Thompson (guitar and vocals), Rihana Abdulrashid-Davis (bass and keyboards) and Lena Faske (drums) -- looked equally blas\u233\'00\'E9 as they broke down their equipment.\par \par \uc2 Though their stage presence might suggest otherwise, the girls are still unmistakably ninth and 10th graders. It was visible in Willow's fiery streaked hair and in Dea's macram\u233\'00\'E9 friendship bracelets. It was visible, too, in the way the girls interlaced fingers absent-mindedly when they talked away from the concert.\par \par \uc2 But they also exhibited a maturity out of character for most 14-year-olds. They rarely interrupted one another. There was a notable dearth of giggle fits. And, ever professional, they remembered to state their names for the digital recorder each time they spoke when being interviewed.\par \par \uc2 Of course, they are not above being star-struck when meeting their heroes, like Kathleen Hanna of the bands Bikini Kill and Le Tigre, the original ''riot grrrl,'' at a benefit show. (''Oh, my God, I died,'' Willow pealed.) But they remain largely unconcerned about meeting anyone else's standards when it comes to their constantly evolving sound (they name MGMT, Sufjan Stevens, the Who and Joan Jett as inspirations).\par \par \uc2 ''We get our influences from so many places, but when we put them all together, it becomes our own genre,'' Dea said.\par \par \uc2 ''It can't be categorized,'' Rihana concurred.\par \par \uc2 This diverse group came together after being matched up at Willie Mae Rock Camp for Girls in Brooklyn when they were 11; they had all been attending the camp separately for years beforehand. The camp, a nonprofit music-mentoring program, was started in 2004 by a small cadre of female musicians who sought to teach girls as young as 5 how to play instruments by encouraging them to collaborate in a rock band for a week.\par \par \uc2 ''We knew we clicked well because we had that whole week to write a song, but we wrote ours in a day,'' Lena said.\par \par \uc2 Harsh Crowd is Willie Mae Rock Camp's longest-running musical byproduct to date, and a rarity in that its members stayed together after camp. The girls meet for three hours every Saturday to practice, with a summer hiatus for family vacations.\par \par \uc2 Caryn Havlik, 43, their band coach and de facto cheerleader, has been working with the group since she met the girls at Willie Mae that first week. Ms. Havlik, who helped found the camp and has been mentoring campers since its inception, recalled Harsh Crowd's first live performance as ''transcendent.''\par \par \uc2 ''They had a vision,'' she said. ''They executed it.''\par \par \uc2 The girls settled on the name Harsh Crowd after a fruitless brainstorming session yielded nothing but duds like Unicorn Death and the Black Roses. The name now bears some personal significance, at least for Dea. ''When we started, we were all vulnerable and scared,'' she said. ''But if we are called Harsh Crowd, there's no room for the audience to be that. So for me it's kind of a security blanket.''\par \par \uc2 So far, it has worked. Since the group's formation, Harsh Crowd's members have found themselves a bit shellshocked, in a good way, by their steady ascent in the fickle New York rock scene. They have opened for such indie-rock luminaries as the Brooklyn singer-songwriter Mirah, Amy Ray of the Indigo Girls and Sharon Van Etten. On \uc2 Twitter\uc2  in April, Gloria Steinem posted a link to the band's video for its song ''Four Walls,'' describing Harsh Crowd as ''fierce, young, talented.''\par \par \uc2 In an email, Mirah recalled meeting the girls one day after the November 2015 terrorist attacks in Paris. Harsh Crowd was rehearsing for a show last December at the Ace Hotel in the Flatiron district where it would serve as Mirah's backing band. ''They were so engaged and critical and smart,'' she wrote. ''They work hard, they love music and they have a beautiful camaraderie and instinct to support and care for each other.''\par \par \uc2 All four teenagers stand in a fierce opposition to being labeled a ''girl band,'' and their songs are full of budding political activism. The song ''Clowns'' on their new EP is a critique of the 2016 \uc2 election\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Lena's father, Tony Faske, described the girls' relationship as more professional than collegial, noting their distinct ''workmanlike attitude.''\par \par \uc2 ''They love each other, but they're serious about the music side of it,'' said Mr. Faske, who also serves as the band's unofficial manager and sometime chauffeur. ''They've got to keep it separate.''\par \par \uc2 Dea's mother, Rikke Brogaard, said she was surprised by the girls' dedication to prioritizing band obligations over goofing off: ''I figured that they would just do this for a minute, then do other stuff.'' But the girls themselves say they are close, and they make a point of getting together for occasional band sleepovers where they watch movies and, according to Lena, ''eat a lot.''\par \par \uc2 Though Harsh Crowd remains a New York City band, the girls have lately become a bit geographically scattered. Lena lives in Manhattan, Dea in the Fort Greene section of Brooklyn; Willow has just started at a prep school upstate, and Rihana's family lives in Mount Vernon, in Westchester County.\par \par \uc2 Yet every Saturday, the girls meet to practice at the Willie Mae headquarters in \uc2 Clinton\uc2  Hill, a feat requiring coordination and patience on the parts of band members and parents. Rihana's mother, Jamila Abdulrashid, drives her in from Mount Vernon, waits as the girls rehearse and then drives her home afterward. Ms. Abdulrashid is happy to do it, but she added: ''The main challenge is them staying focused academically and musically. They've had gigs on school nights -- not many, but a few.''\par \par \uc2 When it comes to their future ambitions, the girls are still figuring things out. Rihana said she has wanted to ''play music and be a doctor'' since she was 4, so she is considering possibilities related to music therapy. Lena envisions herself in California, and Dea hopes to go to \uc2 Brown University\uc2 , with the possible goal of becoming a music producer. Willow is the only one who intends to stick with performing full time. ''I don't think I'd be able to do anything else with my life,'' she said. ''I hope it works out.''\par \par \uc2 Despite all of their poise and precociousness, they are still just teenagers. They get crushes. They are obsessed with ''delicious'' Gummy Tummy penguins. They feel adrift without Snapchat. And there are at least a few people out there whose attention they would prefer to avoid: the kids in their school.\par \par \uc2 Ms. Brogaard remembered meeting a few of Dea's friends soon after she joined Harsh Crowd. ''Don't tell them I'm in a band,'' she instructed her mother. ''I don't like to mix business and pleasure.''\par \par \uc2 Rihana, who fills the role of the contemplative bass player, recalled being put on the spot when a school security guard ''came up and asked me to sign a $20 bill'' after seeing her in a segment about the band on NY1.\par \par \uc2 ''Nobody knows at my school,'' Willow claimed. ''And they will not know.'' That may be changing soon.\par \par \uc2 Harsh Crowd this month in Manhattan. From left, Dea Brogaard-Thompson, Willow Bennison, Lena Faske and Rihana Abdulrashid-Davis.

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 The witching hour is upon us.\par \par \uc2 I'm talking not about Halloween but about \uc2 Election\uc2  Day -- which, if you believe a vocal subset of conspiracy theorists, is when we'll all get hexed.\par \par \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's more extreme critics routinely refer to her as a witch -- earlier this month, Joseph Farah at World Net Daily asked, ''Can you even imagine enduring four years of this witch as president?'' He was presumably speaking figuratively, but a quick scroll through the \uc2 Twitter\uc2  hashtag #WitchHillary reveals that some people believe Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  actually practices the dark arts.\par \par \uc2 Several videos posted to \uc2 YouTube\uc2  in the last year attempt to make this case. One, titled ''\uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  -- The Antichrist or the Illuminati Witch?'' includes testimony by the \uc2 Clinton\uc2  conspiracy theorist Larry Nichols, who claims that Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  routinely left Arkansas to worship with a group of women at a ''witches' church'' in Los Angeles.\par \par \uc2 Portraying powerful women as witches is a time-honored tactic. The writers Barbara Ehrenreich and Deirdre English have argued that the first accusations of witchcraft in Europe grew out of male doctors' anxieties about competition from female healers. Even when such accusations aren't literal, they are attempts to delegitimize women's authority by painting women as devious, corrupt and scheming. The alt-right radio host Alex Jones, for instance, recently called Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  an ''evil wicked witch'' who wanted to steal the \uc2 election\uc2  and who was ''picked by the globalists to curse this country.''\par \par \uc2 In her excellent essay on \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  and Victoria Woodhull, the first woman to run for president and a practicing Spiritualist, Jessa Crispin argues that we could use more witchcraft in our politics, not less. Witches, she writes, have ''faith in the balance between humans and the natural world, in the power of sexuality, in human equality and dignity, and in community over hierarchical power or authority.''\par \par \uc2 These values have been powerfully absent from a campaign season dominated by a man who once boasted that his wealth and status allowed him to grab women's genitals. To find the spirit of witchcraft as Ms. Crispin explains it, we may have to look to pop culture.\par \par \uc2 ''Blair Witch,'' released last month, is something of a disappointment in this regard. The villain of the film, a sequel to the 1999 classic ''The Blair Witch Project,'' is not so much a traditional witch as a mysterious entity with a wide array of seemingly unrelated powers, including the ability to stop the rotation of the earth and to induce foot infections.\par \par \uc2 ''The Witch,'' released in February, is more interesting. An exploration of age-old anxieties about female sexuality and power, it tells the story of a young woman accused of witchcraft so often that she decides to embrace it. It will also make you afraid of goats.\par \par \uc2 For a fuller examination of what a politics of witchcraft might look like, though, I recommend ''The Craft.'' This 1996 film, which follows four high school students who form a coven, isn't necessarily a how-to guide for successful witching, since things don't end well for all the characters, but it is a story of women coming together to develop and use their awesome powers to punish their enemies. If you're looking for some relief from the misogyny exhibited by this year's Republican nominee, you could do a lot worse.\par \par \uc2 Follow The \uc2 New York Times\uc2  Opinion section on \uc2 Facebook\uc2  and \uc2 Twitter\uc2  (@NYTopinion), and sign up for the Opinion Today newsletter.\par \par \uc2 Document NYTF000020161023ecan000a0\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 NASHVILLE -- A few years ago an app surfaced on \uc2 Facebook\uc2  that could identify how many of your friends were liberal and how many were conservative. One of my real-life friends clicked the button to see how her \uc2 Facebook\uc2  list stacked up and was shocked by the result. ''I had no idea I liked so many Republicans,'' she said.\par \par \uc2 No wonder she was surprised. \uc2 Facebook\uc2  is very, very good at tracking our political leanings -- and at serving up more of what it has decided we want. So we interact online with like-minded people far more than we do with those whose views we find objectionable. And online it's easy for a heated exchange, or even a sorry joke, to end with the unfriend button. A recent study in The American Journal of Political Science concluded that in terms of political identity, ''the polarization of the American electorate has dramatically increased.'' The article is titled ''Fear and Loathing Across Party Lines.''\par \par \uc2 Maybe that's true on \uc2 Facebook\uc2 , but are the lines really so clear in ordinary life? People aren't simply their political opinions, not even the most deeply held and sacred ones. Surely we are all so much more than the shrill conversation online implies.\par \par \uc2 Twenty-one years ago, my husband and I bought our house here, in what was Nashville's answer to Levittown -- a circle of small, plain, matching houses built for young families buying their first homes thanks to the G.I. Bill. Once the original homeowners began to cash out and head to retirement communities, young families like ours moved in, and things started to look the way they surely did back in the '50s. Children race through the half-acre yards in half-feral packs, climbing back fences and low-branched trees as hide-and-seek gives way to flashlight tag in the failing light.\par \par \uc2 With one family's oldest child best-friending another family's youngest, relationships continue to spread and deepen even as new families move in and a younger crew replaces the kids now old enough to drive. My own children are mostly grown now, and I don't know my younger neighbors as well as I know the parents of the children who grew up with mine, but I know they are still calling one another to ask: ''Are the kids in your yard? Did they say where they were going?''\par \par \uc2 That's how friendships, not ''friend''-ships, are formed.\par \par \uc2 Most of my children's packmates have left for college, but you'll still find me standing in the street with their mothers, or sitting with them on the porch, or carpooling with them to the closest taco place. We talk about what all longtime friends discuss: our aging parents, books and sex and movies and bras and all the ways we've embarrassed our kids lately.\par \par \uc2 What we don't ever talk about is politics. But it's not as if we don't all know where we stand. During the last \uc2 election\uc2 , when canvassers from the beleaguered Tennessee Democratic Party were making the rounds, several neighbors pointed them toward our house. When one of them arrived, he said, ''You're the token liberals around here, I guess.''\par \par \uc2 We aren't actually the only liberals here, but political leanings are beside the point on this little block. Knowing our neighbors' party affiliations would tell you nothing about which one of them makes a killer margarita, or which one volunteers at a homeless shelter, or which one secretly hung a lime-green thong on the back side of a neighbor's Christmas tree after the caroling party.\par \par \uc2 For more than two decades we have fed one another's dogs and watered one another's tomatoes and seen one another through every struggle imaginable: infertility and childbirth and postpartum depression and infidelity and divorce and troubled teenagers and dying parents and medical crises and, by far the most devastating of all, the loss of a child. Is there any difference at the ballot box that could even touch what it means to clutch a friend in the street, wailing, or to text in the middle of the night, grieving in the dark?\par \par \uc2 Our votes may cancel out, but we belong to one another. Years ago one of my neighbors tried to tell his wife that it would make more sense to move out than to add a second story onto the 65-year-old foundation of their house. Her response: ''The only way I'm leaving this neighborhood is in a box.''\par \par \uc2 This summer Justice \uc2 Ruth Bader Ginsburg\uc2  caused a little uproar when she joked about moving to New Zealand if \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  were elected, but we all know she isn't going anywhere.

\par\par \uc2 National Desk; SECTA\par \b \uc2 Democrat, Deft With Rifle, Tightens Senate Race\b0\par\par\uc2 By JENNIFER STEINHAUER; Rachel Shorey contributed reporting from Washington. \par \uc2 1,389 \uc2 words\par \uc2 23 October 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 1\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 O'FALLON, Mo. -- For much of the year, Democrats viewed Jason Kander as a perfect Senate candidate running in the wrong state.\par \par \uc2 A charismatic former military intelligence officer and Missouri's current secretary of state, Mr. Kander, 35, faced an entrenched Republican incumbent in a place where \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2  seemed destined to win.\par \par \uc2 Then Mr. Kander released a television ad last month in which he put an AR-15 assault rifle together blindfolded while reciting a script about gun rights, and started assailing his rival, Senator Roy D. Blunt, on his lobbyist ties.\par \par \uc2 Suddenly, it was game on. Mr. Kander's poll numbers soared. So did the panic among Republicans trying to save Mr. Blunt, and possibly their Senate majority.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Kander's ascent is the starkest demonstration of the volatile and at times confounding dynamics of the battle for control of the Senate, with at least six races in a statistical dead heat just over two weeks before \uc2 Election\uc2  Day.\par \par \uc2 Surprisingly, Democrats have improved their chances in places like Missouri and North Carolina, where they seemed to have no shot just six months ago, while they have all but given up in Ohio and pulled their money out of Florida, where prospects had seemed bright. Republicans continue to cling to hope in New Hampshire, Nevada and Pennsylvania, despite what looks like faltering support for Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  in those states.\par \par \uc2 In several cases, individual state dynamics, candidate quality and a last-minute spending spree have had as much to do with the shifting prospects as the top of the ticket.\par \par \uc2 ''With two weeks to go, control of the Senate is up for grabs,'' said \uc2 Nathan Gonzales\uc2 , editor of The Rothenberg & Gonzales Political Report. ''If Republicans can break even in the tossup states, they have a chance to maintain control. But if the landscape shifts just a couple of points against Republican candidates, Democrats will capture the majority.''\par \par \uc2 In perhaps the oddest quirk of a decidedly erratic year, Mr. Kander may be benefiting from Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's anti-establishment message. Mr. Blunt, who has served in Congress since 1997 and whose family is chockablock with lobbyists, is the archetypal boogeyman Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  has attacked in his assault on Washington insiders.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Kander often finds \uc2 Trump\uc2  and \uc2 Clinton\uc2  supporters at his campaign event -- people who fight among themselves, he said, even as they share support for him.\par \par \uc2 ''There are people who will choose to vote for \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  because they want to shake up that conversation,'' Mr. Kander said in an interview in St. Louis. ''They are not going to go to that next line on the ballot and vote for somebody who they know is exactly who \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  is talking about.''\par \par \uc2 Until 2004, Missouri was an even more reliable presidential bellwether state than Ohio. But growing homogeneity outside its larger cities has made it more reliably Republican on the presidential level. Still, it remains a state where voters have a tendency to pick Democrats for other statewide offices.\par \par \uc2 ''The misconception about Missouri is that it is a red state,'' said Ken Warren, a professor of political science at St. Louis University. ''They don't like Democrats at the top of the ticket because they are seen as from out of town. But most of our statewide offices are held by Democrats.''\par \par \uc2 It is a reality that Mr. Blunt seems to be just starting to confront, much to his party's chagrin. ''It's a competitive race, like Missouri races usually are,'' he said in an interview at the local Republican headquarters here, where he nibbled on a depressing-looking bagel grabbed off a buffet, the sort of campaign sustenance typical of the exhausting final weeks on the road. ''I'm confident of where we are. But not overly confident.''\par \par \uc2 As of mid-October, Mr. Blunt led Mr. Kander 46 percent to 44 percent, a three-percentage-point drop since August. Democrats need to gain five seats to retake control of the Senate -- four if \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  wins the presidency, which would give Tim Kaine, her vice president, a tiebreaking vote. Both parties now, surprisingly, view Missouri as a crucial state in that battle.\par \par \uc2 ''I'm the 51st vote,'' Mr. Blunt warned a small group of female Republican voters here on Thursday, casting himself as the critical piece of a majority. ''If Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  gets elected, the last place to have an impact on the court is the Senate,'' he said, referring to the \uc2 United States Supreme Court\uc2 . (It actually takes 60 votes to bring a Supreme Court nomination to the Senate floor.)\par \par \uc2 In an extremely costly year for Senate races over all, Missouri has become the show-me-the-money state, with $15 million in ads pouring into its race. Two weeks after Mr. Kander's now-famous gun ad in September, political action committees and other outside groups dropped more than $8 million into the state on the two candidates, quadruple what they had spent in the previous two weeks, according to filings with the \uc2 Federal \uc2 Election\uc2  Commission\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Mr. Kander has benefited from being a sui generis blend: At once, he is a gun-wielding Democrat, a veteran, a Georgetown-educated lawyer who wears the outsider label, and the opponent of an incumbent who is the embodiment of Washington longevity.\par \par \uc2 He has focused on trying to turn Mr. Blunt's experience into a liability. He has also homed in on the senator's tangled family ties. Mr. Blunt's wife is a lobbyist, and his three adult children are registered lobbyists as well. Mr. Kander's ads and those of outside groups have suggested, among other things, that Mr. Blunt took votes to enrich industries that his family represented.\par \par \uc2 For his part, Mr. Blunt and those groups supporting him have tried to cast Mr. Kander, who was a state representative before becoming secretary of state in 2013, as a toady for Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  and President Obama, who are both unpopular here. One ad shows his face morphing into theirs with the tagline: ''Fresh face. Same old liberal thinking.''\par \par \uc2 ''Senator Blunt genuinely sees everything through the lens of partisan politics,'' Mr. Kander said. (Actually, Mr. Blunt is widely viewed as a consummate deal-maker in Congress.)\par \par \uc2 Mr. Kander's military service is a boost, too, in a state with many veterans. Mr. Blunt's draft deferments have also come up during the campaign, and he recently brought in another Republican senator, Joni Ernst, who has served in the military, to support him at a veterans' event. ''Flag-waving goes a long way here,'' Professor Warren said. ''Superpatriotism is a big thing in Missouri.''\par \par \uc2 Missouri's contest is indicative of the circumstances in many Senate races.\par \par \uc2 While Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  is weak in Pennsylvania, for instance, the incumbent, Senator Patrick J. Toomey, has managed to keep the race close by dint of his own record and a Democratic candidate who has been less exciting that her party anticipated. At the same time, in a battle over an open seat in Nevada, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  has been a drag on the Republican candidate, United States Representative Joe Heck, not because Mr. Heck supports Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  but because his support for the Republican nominee has waned.\par \par \uc2 ''In most cases \uc2 Trump\uc2  is responsible'' for Republican weaknesses, said Jennifer Duffy, senior editor for The Cook Political Report ''but there are quirky things going on.''\par \par \uc2 It is the sort of year that produces voters like Michael Brown, a Vietnam veteran and conservative Republican who came to a small round-table discussion last week with Mr. Kander in Cape Girardeau. Mr. Brown will not vote for Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , he said, but remains undecided about the Senate race. ''This year is the toughest vote I've ever cast,'' he said.\par \par \uc2 Follow The \uc2 New York Times\uc2 's politics and Washington coverage on \uc2 Facebook\uc2  and \uc2 Twitter\uc2 , and sign up for the First Draft politics newsletter.\par \par \uc2 Jason Kander assembled an AR-15 blindfolded in an ad.

\par\par \uc2 Washington; SECT\par \b \uc2 The Calculus in Six Crucial Senate Races\b0\par\par\uc2 By JENNIFER STEINHAUER \par \uc2 649 \uc2 words\par \uc2 23 October 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 The New York Times on the Web\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 A look at the political math in six states where tight races could determine control of the Senate:\par \par \uc2 NORTH CAROLINA\par \par \uc2 Gay rights battle + Incumbent slow to respond to challenger = Tougher race for Republican\par \par \uc2 Senator Richard Burr, a Republican, was thought to be a safe bet for re-\uc2 election\uc2  against Deborah Ross, his Democratic challenger, who is a former state representative and head of the state's chapter of \uc2 the American Civil Liberties Union\uc2 . But North Carolina has been roiled by a fight over bathroom rights for transgender people that has affected almost every campaign. The national Republican Party has swooped in to try to save Mr. Burr's bid.\par \par \uc2 _____\par \par \uc2 PENNSYLVANIA\par \par \uc2 Suburban women + \uc2 Clinton\uc2  strength + Minority votes = Democratic edge\par \par \uc2 Katie McGinty, a Democrat, is trying to become Pennsylvania's first female senator with a bid to unseat Senator Patrick J. Toomey, a Republican who has managed to keep a moderate image around the state because of a (failed) gun safety bill that bore his name. \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's coattails -- and \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's anvil -- have made a difference here.\par \par \uc2 _____\par \par \uc2 NEW HAMPSHIRE\par \par \uc2 Debate misstep on \uc2 Trump\uc2  + Strong challenger = Imperiled G.O.P. incumbent\par \par \uc2 Senator Kelly Ayotte, a Republican, is suffering from an uncomfortable association with Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , most notably when she had to release a statement walking back her suggestion during a debate that Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  was a role model for children. Gov. Maggie Hassan, her Democratic challenger, is getting major assistance from national party figures like Vice President \uc2 Joseph R. Biden Jr\uc2 . and Senator Bernie Sanders in what is widely viewed as the closest Senate race in the country.\par \par \uc2 _____\par \par \uc2 MISSOURI\par \par \uc2 Young war veteran + Breakthrough ad + Anti-establishment sentiment = Possible upset of the cycle\par \par \uc2 Senator Roy D. Blunt was on no lists of endangered incumbents. Then his Democratic challenger, Jason Kander, an Afghanistan veteran who is \uc2 Missouri's secretary of state\uc2 , conjured up an ad in which he assembled an assault rifle blindfolded while speaking of gun rights. It was a clever way to both fend off attacks over gun control and underscore Mr. Blunt's Vietnam deferments in a very pro-military state. Mr. Blunt's decades of service in Washington are also out of style this year.\par \par \uc2 _____\par \par \uc2 INDIANA\par \par \uc2 Revolving door + Trumplandia = It's tough to come home again\par \par \uc2 Evan Bayh\uc2 , a Democrat, is trying to reclaim his Senate seat but is finding that his time as a Washington insider is a serious liability. Representative Todd Young, with the help of millions of dollars in outside money, is painting a dark picture of Mr. Bayh as a greedy lobbyist who abandoned his voters, and Mr. Bayh's double-digit lead has shrunk significantly. Indiana is \uc2 Trump\uc2  country, and Mr. Bayh, who was once a very popular governor, is going to need Republican voters who remember him fondly to split their tickets.\par \par \uc2 _____\par \par \uc2 NEVADA\par \par \uc2 Ground game war + An uncertain Hispanic vote + Reid's obsession = Who knows?\par \par \uc2 For a while, it did not seem that Catherine Cortez Masto, a Democrat who is a former state attorney general, would catch up to Representative Joe Heck, a Republican who seemed a good fit for his state and this cycle. But Mr. Heck, by turning away from Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  after the presidential candidate was heard bragging about sexual assault in a 2005 recording, began to lose some of his base support, living every Republican candidate's nightmare. The Hispanic vote, important here, is hard to poll. But Ms. Cortez Masto is now narrowly ahead in the race, a battle for the seat of Senator Harry Reid in which the retiring Democratic leader has unleashed his political machine in support of her.\par \par \uc2 Follow The \uc2 New York Times\uc2 's politics and Washington coverage on \uc2 Facebook\uc2  and \uc2 Twitter\uc2 , and sign up for the First Draft politics newsletter.\par \par \uc2 Document NYTF000020161023ecan0008j\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Even as \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  appears poised to win easily against a highly erratic candidate with a campaign in meltdown, a sobering reality awaits Democrats on Nov. 9. It seems likely that they will eke out at most a narrow majority in the Senate, but fail to pick up the 30 seats they need to reclaim the House. If they do manage to win a Senate majority, it will be exceedingly difficult to hold it past 2018, when 25 of the party's seats must be defended, compared with eight Republican ones.\par \par \uc2 The Republican Party may seem in historic disarray, but it will most likely be able to continue to stymie the Democrats' legislative agenda, perpetuating Washington's gridlock for years to come.\par \par \uc2 Liberals have a simple explanation for this state of affairs: Republican-led gerrymandering, which has put Democrats at a disadvantage in the House and in many state legislatures. But this overlooks an even bigger problem for their party. Democrats today are sorting themselves into geographic clusters where many of their votes have been rendered all but superfluous, especially in elections for the Senate, House and state government.\par \par \uc2 This has long been a problem for the party, but it has grown worse in recent years. The clustering has economic and demographic roots, but also a basic cultural element: Democrats just don't want to live where they'd need to live to turn more of the map blue.\par \par \uc2 Americans' tendency toward political self-segregation has been underway for a while now -- it's been eight years since Bill Bishop identified the dynamic in ''The Big Sort.'' This helps explain why red-blue maps of so many states consist of dark-blue islands in the cities surrounded by red exurbs and rural areas, a distribution that is also driven by urban concentrations of racial minorities and by the decades-long shift in allegiance from Democratic to Republican among working-class white voters.\par \par \uc2 That hyper-concentration of Democratic votes has long hurt the party in the House and state legislatures. In Ohio, for instance, Republicans won 75 percent of the United States House seats in 2012 despite winning only 51 percent of the total votes. That imbalance can be explained partly by Republican gerrymandering. But even if district lines were drawn in rational, nonpartisan ways, a disproportionate share of Democratic votes would still be clustered in urban districts, giving Republicans a larger share of seats than their share of the overall vote. Winning back control of state legislatures in Pennsylvania and Michigan could help Democrats in redistricting after 2020. But it would help more if their voters were not so concentrated in Philadelphia and Pittsburgh, Detroit and Ann Arbor.\par \par \uc2 ''It would be awfully difficult to construct a map that wasn't leaning Republican,'' said the University of Michigan political scientist Jowei Chen. ''Geography is just very unfortunate from the perspective of the Democrats.''\par \par \uc2 More recently, a confluence of several trends has conspired to make the sorting disadvantageous for Democrats on an even broader scale -- increasing the party's difficulties in House races while also affecting Senate elections and, potentially, future races for the presidency.\par \par \uc2 First, geographic mobility in the United States has become very class-dependent. Once upon a time, lower-income people were willing to pull up stakes and move to places with greater opportunity -- think of the people who fled the Dust Bowl for California in the 1930s, or those who took the ''Hillbilly Highway'' out of Appalachia to work in Midwestern factories, or Southern blacks on the Great Migration. In recent decades, though, internal migration has slowed sharply, and the people who are most likely to move for better opportunities are the highly educated.\par \par \uc2 Second, higher levels of education are increasingly correlated with voting Democratic. This has been most starkly on display in the 2016 \uc2 election\uc2 , as polls suggest that \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2  may be the first Republican in 60 years to not win a majority of white voters with college degrees, even as he holds his own among white voters without degrees. But the trend of increasing Democratic identification among college graduates, and increasing Republican identification among non-graduates, was underway before Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  arrived on the scene. Today, Democrats hold a 12-point edge in party identification among those with a college degree or more. In 2004, the parties were even on that score.\par \par \uc2 Finally, in the United States the economic gap between the wealthiest cities and the rest of the country has grown considerably. The internet was supposed to allow wealth to spread out, since we could be connected anywhere -- but the opposite has happened. Per capita income in the District of Columbia has gone from 29 percent above the United States average in 1980 to 68 percent in 2013; in the Bay Area, from 50 percent above to 88 percent; in New York City, from 80 percent above to 172 percent. Cities like New York, San Francisco, Seattle and Boston exert a strong pull on mobile, highly educated, Democratic-leaning voters, while at the same time stirring resentment in the less prosperous areas those voters leave behind. And these economically dominant cities tend to be in deep-blue states.\par \par \uc2 How extreme is Democratic clustering? If you compare President Obama's 2012 performance with Al Gore's in 2000, you can see a huge increase in the Democratic percentage of the vote in the 68 largest metro areas. But it barely budged everywhere else. Some of that increase was caused by voters already in those cities flipping from Republican to Democratic. But it was also the gravitational effect.\par \par \uc2 This clustering of Democrats helps explain why Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  has been keeping it close in Ohio and Iowa, both states where some 72 percent of white residents over 24 lack college degrees, the highest share among the 13 most competitive states.\par \par \uc2 It works the other way in presidential elections, too. Democrats have gained in some other swing states with high levels of college-educated voters, like Virginia and Colorado, and they do at least reap a benefit in the Electoral College for having a lock on big states such as New York and California.\par \par \uc2 But it's another story in the Senate, where this dynamic helps explain why the Democrats are perpetually struggling to hold a majority. The Democrats have long been at a disadvantage in the Senate, where the populous, urbanized states where Democrats prevail get the same two seats as the rural states where Republicans are stronger. The 20 states where Republicans hold both Senate seats have, on average, 5.2 million people each; the 16 states where the Democrats hold both seats average 7.9 million people. Put another way, winning Senate elections in states with a total of 126 million people has netted the Democrats eight fewer seats than the Republicans get from winning states with 104 million people.\par \par \uc2 Clustering is part of the problem. All those Democrats gravitating to blue strongholds like New York and California get the party no more Senate seats than Republicans get from Idaho and from Wyoming, a state with a population of about 580,000, slightly more than Fresno, Calif. If the Democrats are going to gain a lasting hold on the Senate, they have to win seats in swing states. But that gets harder the more that Democratic-leaning voters flock to big, blue states, abandoning swing states like Ohio, where the Republican Rob Portman is gliding to re-\uc2 election\uc2 , or smaller red states where Democrats might still have a shot at holding Senate seats, like Montana, Indiana or North Dakota.\par \par \uc2 Jenn Topper has thought about this dynamic a lot, because she's a clear example of it. Ms. Topper, 31, grew up in Beavercreek, Ohio, a suburb of Dayton, a city that has lost nearly half its population since 1960. She left for college at Florida State, then for a public relations job in New York, then for a political communications job in Washington.\par \par \uc2 ''When you grow up in Ohio, there's a bigger world out there, and if you know about it, you just want to go to it,'' she said.\par \par \uc2 A couple of years ago, Ms. Topper and some colleagues who were also from Ohio were excited to meet ''their'' Democratic senator, Sherrod Brown, at an event. He asked them where they lived in Ohio. But they don't live in Ohio -- and won't be able to vote for him in what is sure to be a tough race in 2018.\par \par \uc2 Ms. Topper's high school classmate Brett Stelter, 31, left Dayton after attending \uc2 Ohio University\uc2 . His father was a district parts manager for Honda, which has a plant near Dayton, and Mr. Stelter himself did part-time work at the plant. But his dream was to be an actor, and so he ended up in Los Angeles.\par \par \uc2 ''There's just nothing to do in Ohio,'' he said. ''The jobs are limited, but it's not just the jobs and the industries that are in Ohio, it's the mind-set that I didn't gravitate to.''\par \par \uc2 Mr. Stelter, who voted twice for Mr. Obama, is disappointed that his vote is superfluous in California, and tries to make up for it by engaging on social media with people back home -- people like his father, who is leaning toward Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 . ''Part of me wishes I could be there to personally talk to people instead of trolling them on the internet,'' he said. But his political irrelevance is not enough to make him consider moving back. ''Going back to Ohio to be able to vote every four years is not enough for me.''\par \par \uc2 This clustering is happening even as many smaller cities and outlying regions are experiencing mini-cultural renaissances. For one thing, a foodie or beer snob now has much less to complain about when contemplating dining outside a big coastal city. And most of these places are much more affordable than Brooklyn or Los Angeles. But they can't seem to compare with the profusion of cool elsewhere.\par \par \uc2 Even cities making comebacks, with restored downtown buildings and plenty of locally brewed I.P.A., have the memory problem. If a city was on the ropes when young people left it, it's frozen in that form in their image of it. ''You're competing with memory,'' Ms. Topper said. ''People look back and remember what it was like when they were there. You don't often hear about how things are moving or growing or new things are happening. That picture of when you have left is all you have.''\par \par \uc2 Of course, some people do go back. Brittney Vosters, 30, who went to high school and college in Dayton, left for several years, living in Chicago and enrolling in graduate school in public administration at Rutgers in New Jersey. She recently moved back to Cincinnati so her husband could go to graduate school in northern Kentucky. It has struck her how much her former Dayton classmates have sorted out politically. ''It's noticeable that the people who left are more liberal-minded and the people who stayed are more Republican,'' she said.\par \par \uc2 And this sorting out is self-perpetuating, too. The fewer people you encounter of the opposite political persuasion, the more they become an unfathomable other, easily caricatured and impossible to find even occasional common ground with. By segregating themselves in narrow slices of the country, Democrats have also made it harder to make their own case. They are forever preaching to the converted, while their social distance also leaves them unprepared for what's coming from the other end of the spectrum. Changing that would mean adopting a broader notion of what it means to live in a happening place, and also exposing themselves to discomforts that most people naturally avoid, given the human tendency to seek out our own kind.\par \par \uc2 Ms. Vosters, for one, appreciates that her vote counts a lot more now in Ohio than it did when she was in New Jersey and Illinois. But she has no doubt where she'd like to end up for good. For her next move, she said, ''I'd look at the political map and go toward the blue, because it's more comfortable to be around people who are like you.

PETERS \par \uc2 369 \uc2 words\par \uc2 23 October 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 The New York Times on the Web\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 The Log Cabin Republicans, a conservative gay and lesbian political organization, declined on Saturday to endorse \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2  for president, revealing split feelings within the group over whether the Republican nominee is really the advocate of gay rights he claims to be.\par \par \uc2 Citing the Russian proverb that Ronald Reagan used to sum up his feelings on negotiating with the Soviets -- ''Trust but verify'' -- the group said in a written statement that it was not yet prepared to fully support Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's candidacy.\par \par \uc2 ''Should Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  become our nation's next president, Log Cabin Republicans welcomes the opportunity to work with his administration,'' the statement said. ''Until and unless that happens, our trust would be misplaced.''\par \par \uc2 Instead, Log Cabin Republicans said the organization planned to spend the remaining weeks before the \uc2 election\uc2  working to ensure that its party maintains its majorities in the House and Senate.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's record on gay rights is muddled. And Log Cabin Republicans indicated that its members were torn between the favorable words Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  has spoken about gays, lesbians and transgender people and the anti-gay-rights policies he has embraced.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  has gone further than any Republican nominee in publicly declaring his personal view on the issue -- at the Republican National Convention he announced his belief that ''L.G.B.T.Q. citizens'' should be protected from persecution. But he has also pledged to name Supreme Court justices who would overturn the decision legalizing same-sex marriage, embraced activists from the religious right who want to reverse many of the more recent legal protections put in place and did little as social conservatives pushed through a party platform that is deeply disapproving of gay and lesbian families.\par \par \uc2 ''Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  is perhaps the most pro-L.G.B.T. presidential nominee in the history of the Republican Party,'' Log Cabin Republicans said in its statement. ''Rhetoric alone regarding L.G.B.T. issues does not equate to doctrine,'' it added.\par \par \uc2 Find out what you need to know about the 2016 presidential race today, and get politics news updates via \uc2 Facebook\uc2 , \uc2 Twitter\uc2  and the First Draft newsletter.\par \par \uc2 Document NYTF000020161023ecan0007u\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 In 2004, 57 police officers of different races were divided into two groups for a simple experiment. Half of them were shown two photo lineups, one with an array of white faces and one with black faces. This group was more visually attuned to the white faces. A second group looked at the same lineups after words like ''violent,'' ''crime'' and ''shoot'' flashed on their screens, at the edge of their field of vision. This group of officers' eyes were mostly drawn to the black faces. In a similar test, using pictures of guns and knives instead of words, a group of white college students exhibited a similar shift in attention.\par \par \uc2 The psychologists who did the research described their findings in terms of a ''bias'' in perception, rather than of intentional prejudice. The distinction is important: The test measured the split-second reactions of the police officers and the students, not their considered judgments. This kind of bias lies beneath the surface, implicit and often automatic. ''Just as black faces and black bodies can trigger thoughts of crime, thinking of crime can trigger thoughts of black people,'' the psychologists wrote in an article called ''Seeing Black.''\par \par \uc2 Before the civil rights era, and even more recently, it would have been strange to describe bias as hidden or implicit. Outright bias was codified by Jim Crow, among other laws, and reinforced by discrimination at work, at school and in access to housing. Today, the country imagines itself differently. We have a ''colorblind Constitution,'' Justice \uc2 Clarence Thomas\uc2  asserted nine years ago, at the dawn of the Obama era, as he joined the court's conservative majority to strike down school-desegregation plans. In 2013, Chief Justice \uc2 John Roberts\uc2  decreed that central protections in the Voting Rights Act ''have lost their relevance'' because ''things have changed dramatically'' in the 50 years since the law's initial passage.\par \par \uc2 And yet this dark \uc2 election\uc2  season suggests otherwise. From dim beginning to dimmer end, the campaign has laid bare how bias and accusations of bias are cleaving us from one another. \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  complains that he can't get a fair ruling from a judge of Mexican ancestry, pledges to ban Muslims from entering the country and suggests that a woman doesn't have what it takes to be president on the grounds of her gender. In August, a \uc2 Washington Post\uc2  poll found that 60 percent of Americans believed that \uc2 Trump\uc2  was ''biased against women and minorities.'' And many \uc2 Trump\uc2  supporters believe that \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  is biased against them, based on her statement (for which she later apologized) that half of them are ''deplorable'' and ''irredeemable'' because of their racism, sexism and xenophobia.\par \par \uc2 The most profound division may be over the nature of bias itself. Now that frank prejudice is ostensibly out of bounds, the country finds itself in murkier territory, arguing about the kind of bias that is less obvious and intentional. While some people (mostly on the left) puzzle over the lessons of studies like ''Seeing Black,'' others (mostly on the right) feel blamed for what they see as an imaginary problem.\par \par \uc2 Sigmund Freud popularized the concept of the unconscious in the early decades of the 20th century, describing a model of the mind in which some cognitive processes lie beneath the surface, waiting to be ''discovered and translated into conscious form.'' Beginning in the 1930s, Freud's followers in psychoanalysis theorized that along with fleeting thoughts and feelings, attitudes including prejudice and stereotyping could take root in the unconscious.\par \par \uc2 In 1998, the psychologists Anthony G. Greenwald, Mahzarin R. Banaji and Brian Nosek began a groundbreaking project to test these ideas empirically. They used an ''implicit association test,'' which measured the speed of responses for associating positive and negative terms (''terrific,'' ''lovely,'' ''evil,'' ''hurtful'') with black and white faces, by hitting keys on a computer. More than five million people have taken this test online to date, and the researchers have found that most whites and Asian-Americans more quickly associate positive qualities with white faces than with black ones. So do more than 30 percent of African-Americans.\par \par \uc2 This type of bias stems from the human instinct to order the world, by sorting its pieces into familiar groups. Often, automatic associations are morally neutral, like the link between ''doctor'' or ''nurse'' and ''hospital.'' Instantly connect ''doctor'' to ''he'' and ''nurse'' to ''she,'' however, and the links become more loaded. Still, your choices don't necessarily reveal that your true self is sexist. They express the influence of stereotypes, but they're not an endorsement. ''It's not a comment on your character,'' says Phillip Atiba Goff, one of the psychologists who conducted the experiments in ''Seeing Black,'' with a team led by Jennifer Eberhardt of \uc2 Stanford University\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 In the realm of politics, however, that distinction is easily lost. ''Implicit bias is a problem for everyone,'' \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  said at the first presidential debate in September. She was answering a question about the police, and for a second after responding she paused, perhaps nervous that she would be misinterpreted as painting them as racist. ''I think, unfortunately, too many of us in our great country jump to conclusions about each other,'' \uc2 Clinton\uc2  finished. It took two days for \uc2 Trump\uc2  to twist her words into the accusation ''that everyone, including our police, are basically racist and prejudiced'' -- in other words, you're guilty and you just don't know it.\par \par \uc2 At the vice-presidential debate a couple of weeks after \uc2 Clinton\uc2  and \uc2 Trump\uc2 's exchange, \uc2 Mike Pence\uc2  expressed incredulity that the shooting of Keith Lamont Scott, a black man in Charlotte, by a black police officer could be an example of the same phenomenon. ''Enough of this seeking every opportunity to demean law enforcement broadly by making the accusation of implicit bias every time tragedy occurs,'' he said.\par \par \uc2 Law-enforcement officials do not necessarily see it Pence's way, however. In a speech about race and bias at \uc2 Georgetown University\uc2  last February, the F.B.I. director, James Comey, frankly acknowledged that for many police officers, ''the two young black men on one side of the street look like so many others that officer has locked up. Two white men on the other side of the street, even in the same clothes, do not. The officer does not make the same association about the two white guys, whether that officer is white or black.''\par \par \uc2 Over the summer, the Department of Justice announced that it would start implicit-bias training for 28,000 personnel, including F.B.I. agents, prosecutors and immigration judges. Many police officers already take implicit association tests about race and crime, says \uc2 Noble Wray\uc2 , a former police chief in Madison, Wis., who leads the Policing Practices and Accountability Initiative at the Justice Department. ''We try to help officers understand that if you're going to deal with your implicit biases, you have to be introspective. You have to ask yourself questions about how you're interacting with people.''\par \par \uc2 The stakes of implicit bias may be particularly high in policing, but that's hardly the only area of public and private life where bias has consequences. In the last decade, researchers have repeatedly found a discrepancy among men and women in letters of recommendation for faculty positions in the sciences and in teaching evaluations across various disciplines. Last summer, Sara B. Pritchard, an associate professor of science and technology studies at \uc2 Cornell University\uc2 , ran through the evidence for this kind of gender bias and proposed giving women a scoring bonus for teaching evaluations across the board.\par \par \uc2 ''Critics will no doubt argue that such a policy would give female faculty a distinct and unfair advantage,'' Pritchard wrote in an online post -- and indeed, on a Fox News panel, Tucker Carlson called her idea ''insane.'' One of his fellow panelists was Cabot Phillips of Campus Reform, a conservative group that describes itself as exposing ''bias and abuse'' on college campuses. He cited a study that found that university hiring committees preferred women for positions in the sciences -- when they were competing with identical male candidates. In other words, when women, too, had stellar recommendation letters and teaching evaluations, universities would snap them up to address the gender imbalance in science departments.\par \par \uc2 Phillips, who had just graduated from \uc2 Liberty University\uc2 , said that his favorite college professor was a woman. He meant to undermine the case that gender bias is real. But he was actually exemplifying the effect of working with people across lines of race and gender when they are your equals or betters.\par \par \uc2 This presidential campaign, which began with a wall as its chief symbol, has driven a wedge into the body politic. Polls show a widening split in how men and women plan to vote, and the gap between white voters and those of color is even larger. We have to confront that rift. The work of knitting the country back together means looking inward, to understand the biases we didn't ask to have, and then outward, at people we didn't fully see before.

\par\par \uc2 Arts and Leisure Desk; SECTAR\par \b \uc2 He Shops at Target These Days\b0\par\par\uc2 By DAVE ITZKOFF \par \uc2 2,733 \uc2 words\par \uc2 23 October 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 16\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Why does \uc2 David Letterman\uc2  have a beard? To put it more precisely: Why did Mr. Letterman, after stepping down from \uc2 CBS\uc2 's ''Late Show'' and a 33-year career in late-night television and all but disappearing from public life, spend the past year and a half cultivating a fleecy and prodigious mound of facial hair, which, depending on your disposition, makes this 69-year-old entertainer look like either a lanky Santa Claus or an escapee from an asylum?\par \par \uc2 Did he grow these imposing bristles to keep the world at bay while he withdrew into retirement? Was it his way of saying he was no longer the man who had spent 6,000 evenings reading 4,600 Top 10 lists and interviewing 20,000 guests, and would we now please leave him alone?\par \par \uc2 Actually, Mr. Letterman explained a couple of weeks ago, ''I just got tired of shaving every day, but then it became something else, and I'm not quite sure what it became.''\par \par \uc2 In his dry Midwestern delivery, tinged with a new and unaccustomed element of wistfulness, he said: ''The beard is a good reminder to me that that was a different life. I'm hopeful that I will either find something else, or something else will be presented to me.''\par \par \uc2 He added: ''My family has given up on the beard. My son thinks it's creepy.''\par \par \uc2 One October morning, Mr. Letterman offered these reflections from a perch more than 100 stories above the city, while he contemplated a panoramic view of Lower Manhattan at the observatory of 1 World Trade Center. It was a vantage point where he could make wry, quintessentially Letterman-esque remarks about the bustling realm beneath him. (''There's a Bruce Willis movie right there,'' he said, indicating an office tower in New Jersey.)\par \par \uc2 While Mr. Letterman was still on the air, he projected a fascinating mix of ambition and insecurity, and the tension of those two impulses gave rise to a smart, caustic comedy sensibility that influenced a generation, in a way that no current late-night host has been able to do. He may not have a desk or a microphone for the moment, but he still has the drive and the sarcasm (not to mention the ambivalence), though he is unsure what to do with any of it.\par \par \uc2 The observatory, which he was visiting for the first time, was a place for him to reflect on what more he could do with his life now that he does not have the daily obligation of standing on a stage, telling jokes and talking to famous people.\par \par \uc2 He can appreciate the quotidian activities he's rarely engaged in since the 1980s, like shopping at CVS and \uc2 Walgreens\uc2  or riding the train into Grand Central Terminal. Or he can take 11 days, as he did earlier this year, to travel to India and report on climate change for the season premiere of ''Years of Living Dangerously,'' a documentary series that the National Geographic Channel will show on Sunday, Oct. 30.\par \par \uc2 But, with years of vitality left, he has been trying, since his ''Late Show'' farewell in May 2015, to figure out what his next step should be.\par \par \uc2 Looking inconspicuously average in a long-sleeve T-shirt, slacks and sneakers, with no audience to play to and no house band to punctuate his one-liners, Mr. Letterman said there was one path he would not go back down.\par \par \uc2 ''I don't miss late-night television,'' he said. ''And I'm a little embarrassed that, for 33 years, it was the laser focus of my life.''\par \par \uc2 For all the time he spent vying to succeed Johnny Carson at \uc2 NBC\uc2 's ''The Tonight Show,'' and then locked in combat with his onetime friend Jay Leno, it was Mr. Leno who got the gig instead, and then surpassed him in the ratings. Talking about his own experience, Mr. Letterman said: ''It took a lot of energy, and it probably would have been better expended elsewhere. Now it just seems like, really, that's what you did?''\par \par \uc2 He added, ''I know I succumbed to the pressure of the rivalry that was constructed between Jay and myself.''\par \par \uc2 Pressed further, Mr. Letterman acknowledged that he had not been a passive participant in this competition and that some essential part of himself had been fueling it. ''I think there's something wrong with me,'' he said, only half joking. ''It's either a character flaw or a personality disorder. It's one or the other. I haven't heard back from the lab.''\par \par \uc2 More earnestly, he added: ''Maybe life is the hard way, I don't know. When the show was great, it was never as enjoyable as the misery of the show being bad. Is that human nature?''\par \par \uc2 For him, it was a blow to an internal constitution honed on conflict and a relentless daily schedule when his ''Late Show'' life went away. Mr. Letterman, who keeps residences in Manhattan and in Westchester County, said there was a period immediately after leaving that he spent ''sitting around the house thinking, ooh, I can't sit around the house -- I've got to get out and do something.''\par \par \uc2 Then, little by little, Mr. Letterman had a rapprochement with what you might call normal life. He got to visit Target in the middle of a weekday afternoon. As he explained: ''I'm the guy who holds up lines because he always thinks he has the correct change. 'How much was that? I think I may have the 87 cents.'''\par \par \uc2 He also found that when he lowered his protective barrier and engaged with other civilians, he said, ''People are so much nicer to me than when I had a TV show.'' He chuckled self-deprecatingly and added, ''I think they feel a little sorry for me. 'Let's be nice to the old man.'''\par \par \uc2 (At 1 World Trade Center, Mr. Letterman was offered some protection from onlookers by a small retinue of handlers and a private tour guide; when he was spotted by a group of visitors, he joked, ''Please just wait right there -- we'll get to you in a minute.'')\par \par \uc2 Among other rituals that have kept him focused, Mr. Letterman continues to meet for dinner every few weeks with Paul Shaffer, his bandleader and sidekick at ''Late Show'' and \uc2 NBC\uc2 's ''Late Night.''\par \par \uc2 Mr. Shaffer said that he, too, went through a long period of adjustment after the \uc2 CBS\uc2  series ended. ''It was quite a physical change,'' he said. ''One was pretty tightly wound during that time. You don't just come down off that.''\par \par \uc2 There are few examples of whom Mr. Letterman might try to emulate now. One, as fate would have it, is Mr. Leno, who since leaving ''The Tonight Show,'' has continued to perform stand-up and host a CNBC show, ''Jay Leno's Garage.'' Or, given his longstanding admiration for Mr. Carson, who essentially rode into the sunset, Mr. Shaffer said it was plausible Mr. Letterman might follow that route.\par \par \uc2 ''You thought, chances are, he might do what Johnny did -- just realize I have said what I need to say, and I'm out,'' Mr. Shaffer explained.\par \par \uc2 But in their conversations together, Mr. Shaffer said Mr. Letterman has expressed the desire to get in front of audiences again. ''Just every once in a while,'' Mr. Shaffer said. ''He doesn't need it on that daily basis that we had it. I think he did it long enough to get it out of his system.''\par \par \uc2 Mr. Letterman did not make many prominent public appearances after he left ''Late Show'': a surprise Top 10 list routine at a concert performed by his friends Martin Short and Steve Martin; a live interview with the filmmakers Spike Jonze and Bennett Miller at Ball State University, his alma mater; an unfortunate paparazzi photo that caught him off guard, jogging on the Caribbean island of St. Barts.\par \par \uc2 His brief return to television now, for a single episode of a nonfiction series about global warming, is the result of a process that began while he was still hosting ''Late Show.''\par \par \uc2 The creators of ''Years of Living Dangerously,'' which uses correspondents like Matt Damon and America Ferrera to explore environmental issues around the world, had noticed that Mr. Letterman had been hosting guests like James E. Hansen, the prominent climate scientist. When the producers asked Mr. Letterman if he would participate in the series, they found he was eager to be involved and passionate about the subject matter.\par \par \uc2 ''Dave wanted to do his homework,'' said Joel Bach, a creator and executive producer of the series. ''Most people like Dave would not really care to come in and meet with us -- they'd rather read a brief. He wanted to know where he was going and what he was doing. He had lots of questions and wanted to know everything.''\par \par \uc2 Mr. Letterman, who has a 12-year-old son, Harry, with his wife, Regina, said he has spent a lot of time thinking about what kind of planet their child will inherit.\par \par \uc2 Though he has tried to take environmentally responsible steps like buying electric cars and installing solar panels at his 2,700-acre ranch on the Rocky Mountain Front in Montana, Mr. Letterman asked: ''Does that do anything? Is that a good thing, or am I just the idiot in the electric car?''\par \par \uc2 But by lending his celebrity and his curiosity to ''Years of Living Dangerously,'' Mr. Letterman felt he might help educate viewers on a topic with lasting consequences.\par \par \uc2 ''When my kid asks, 'Did you know that was happening?''' he said, ''I'm fully prepared to say, 'Yeah, and this is what we're doing.'''\par \par \uc2 This past winter, Mr. Letterman and a production crew flew to \uc2 Indira Gandhi International Airport\uc2  in New Delhi (''Two years in a row, the No. 1 airport in the world,'' he said). He visited the city and the state of Uttar Pradesh to see firsthand how India's swelling population was dealing with energy shortages, trying to reduce its dependency on coal and bring power to regions that still lack it.\par \par \uc2 There were many moments of found comedy, like when Mr. Letterman visited a tailor to be fitted for a kurta; he also conducted a serious-minded interview with Prime Minister \uc2 Narendra Modi\uc2  (that nonetheless ended, off-camera, with Mr. Letterman complimenting Mr. Modi on his beard).\par \par \uc2 What has stuck with Mr. Letterman about the trip, all these months later, is how completely different India is from anything he has experienced in America, and what he regards as the fundamentally hopeful nature of the Indian people he encountered.\par \par \uc2 ''You talk about the energy of New York City -- India makes New York City look like nap time,'' he said. ''The first day was very depressing. You smell what you think might be furniture burning, and it never leaves.''\par \par \uc2 ''And then,'' he added, ''one day it would be exhilarating. What never seemed to waver was their optimism. The fact that there's 1.2 billion people is, to them, an asset, where we would think, oh my God, what are we going to do?''\par \par \uc2 Sydney Trattner, a senior producer who traveled with Mr. Letterman, said that he was dogged by self-doubt throughout the journey. ''He never thinks he's doing a good job,'' Ms. Trattner said. ''We had to reassure him constantly, saying, 'Dave, you've probably spent more time talking to people than anybody alive.' And it still wasn't good enough for him.''\par \par \uc2 Then, a couple of weeks after the team returned to the United States, Ms. Trattner said she received a call and was surprised to hear a familiar voice on the line. ''Dave just wanted to chat about the trip,'' she said. ''How it was for me to come off the trip, how it was for him and how he's getting back into real life. We were all touched by the fact that he went to those lengths.''\par \par \uc2 Now that Mr. Letterman has had a taste of doing television that aims to educate a mass audience on serious subjects, he said it was something he would like to do more of, though he is unsure what form that might take.\par \par \uc2 ''I keep saying, jeez, I still think I can do something,'' he said. ''I want that epiphany that others have had. It's the same epiphany that I had about wanting to do a TV show when I was, like, 17. I knew exactly what I wanted to do, and I envy people who, in humanitarian pursuits, have had this realization.''\par \par \uc2 What he is clear he does not want, and does not miss, is the platform provided by a nightly talk show, where he and Mr. Shaffer could riff on current events -- ''Something about it, it just left us,'' he said. Not even the final throes of a presidential \uc2 election\uc2  whose undulations grow wilder by the day made him nostalgic for this.\par \par \uc2 ''It's too big a job,'' said Mr. Letterman, who was nonetheless pleased to see one of his old ''Late Show'' segments, in which he mocked \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2  for outsourcing his clothing line to Asia, used in an advertisement for the \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  campaign. (Mr. Letterman, who often featured Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  as a guest on his shows, spoke to The \uc2 New York Times\uc2  at greater length about his disdain for the Republican presidential nominee, whom he now regards as ''damaged'' and ''a person to be shunned.'')\par \par \uc2 Mr. Letterman said he does not really keep up with any of the current late-night hosts -- not \uc2 Stephen Colbert\uc2 , who replaced him at \uc2 CBS\uc2 , or any of the others whose chummy dynamics elude him.\par \par \uc2 ''The people that are doing late-night now all seem to be buddies,'' he said. ''They all seem to be, 'Well, I'll do your show for a week, and then you can do my show for a week.' It's like, wait a minute -- what's going on here? What happened to the late-night wars?''\par \par \uc2 These days, Mr. Letterman is more into absurdist comedies like ''Veep'' and ''Portlandia,'' which he said was ''relentlessly true to the precept of nonsense''; streaming a documentary if he can figure out his home network connection (''They say, have you selected a Wi-Fi? I don't know. Have I? Maybe I did''); or listening to Harry describe an episode of his favorite cartoon, ''The Amazing World of Gumball.''\par \par \uc2 Mr. Letterman thinks a lot about Harry, who is now entering a socially perilous time in his pubescent life, and was happy to see recently that his son was eager to attend a friend's birthday party. (''It's like six kids at a steakhouse,'' he explained, ''and he loves it, and two of the goons order the 86-ounce porterhouse.'')\par \par \uc2 Still, Mr. Letterman second-guesses himself constantly about how strong or lenient an influence he should be in Harry's life, and he wonders whether trying to steer him in any direction will only cause his son to rebel against him.\par \par \uc2 ''Early on, I did all the things that I liked to do when I was a kid,'' he said. ''Not many of them stuck. Then you realize, all right, we'll just see how this develops. That's probably more fun. You really don't want a carbon copy of yourself running around.''\par \par \uc2 With a grin, Mr. Letterman added: ''I will just say that all of the negative qualities, I think, are from his mother's side. All the positive, uplifting qualities seem to come from the Letterman side. And I don't mean that as an insult, no.''\par \par \uc2 From top, David Letterman at 1 World Trade Center; in India, where he traveled to report on climate change for the documentary series ''Years of Living Dangerously''; and during a final taping of his ''Late Show'' in May 2015.

\par\par \uc2 THE INTERPRETER\par \uc2 National Desk; SECTA\par \b \uc2 Trump\uc2 's Threat to Reject \uc2 Election\uc2  Outcome Alarms Scholars\b0\par\par\uc2 By MAX FISHER; Amanda Taub contributed reporting. \par \uc2 1,357 \uc2 words\par \uc2 23 October 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 22\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's suggestions that he might reject the results of the American \uc2 election\uc2  as illegitimate have unnerved scholars on democratic decline, who say his language echoes that of dictators who seize power by force and firebrand populists who weaken democracy for personal gain.\par \par \uc2 ''To a political scientist who studies authoritarianism, it's a shock,'' said Steven Levitsky, a professor at Harvard. ''This is the stuff that we see in Russia and Venezuela and Azerbaijan and Malawi and Bangladesh, and that we don't see in stable democracies anywhere.''\par \par \uc2 Throughout October, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  has claimed, without evidence, that the vote will be ''rigged'' and ''taken away from us.'' At the final presidential debate, he refused to say he would accept the \uc2 election\uc2 's outcome, and later joked at a rally that he would accept the results ''if I win.''\par \par \uc2 In weak democracies around the world, scholars warned Friday, political leaders have used the same language to erode popular faith in democracy -- often intending to incite violence that will serve their political aims, and sometimes to undo democracy entirely.\par \par \uc2 The United States is not at risk of such worst-case scenarios. American democratic norms and institutions are too strong for any one politician to destabilize. But Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's language, the scholars say, follows a similar playbook and could pose real, if less extreme, risks.\par \par \uc2 ''Almost always, public faith, public trust in institutions is eroded when this happens,'' Mr. Levitsky said of politicians who accuse their opponents of stealing an \uc2 election\uc2  and refuse to concede.\par \par \uc2 Asked whether his study of democratic decline abroad led him to worry about low-level violence in the United States should Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  lose and refuse to concede, he responded, ''I think we should be very worried.''\par \par \uc2 The dictator's playbook\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , whether he knows it or not, is following a playbook -- one that scholars could not recall being used before in modern American politics.\par \par \uc2 By placing blame for his likely loss on electoral fraud, he is telling his supporters not only that the results are flawed, but also that the democratic process has been seized by shadowy forces who are wielding it as a tool of oppression.\par \par \uc2 In this view, ''your opponents are not just somebody that you differ with on policy, it's that they're somehow trying to undermine the will of the people,'' said Sheri Berman, a professor of political science at \uc2 Barnard College\uc2  who studies Europe's descent into fascism in the 1930s.\par \par \uc2 Rejecting elections as rigged, she said, sends the message that both the winner and democracy itself ''fundamentally threaten what the people actually want.''\par \par \uc2 This strategy, she said, is twofold: first, to present the country's democracy as so flawed that a strong leader is required to step in to restore order; and second, to generate unrest that the strongman can wield as leverage.\par \par \uc2 When this works, it starts with voters' concluding that they can restore popular will only through rallies or violence, which happened when Kenyan opposition leaders disputed \uc2 election\uc2  results in 2007. This was followed by widespread violence.\par \par \uc2 In extreme cases, people demand that the military step in to remove what they see as a sham democracy, which happened in Thailand in 2006 and Egypt in 2013. But most cases end with a compromise; for example, the losing side will win extra seats in Parliament or power-sharing within a ''unity government.''\par \par \uc2 Concerns of violence\par \par \uc2 Because this strategy requires supporters to believe that the \uc2 election\uc2  was brazenly stolen, leaders will often spend weeks declaring the vote fraudulent before it is even held -- as Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  has done.\par \par \uc2 ''Merely talking about not accepting results sets off a chain of events that weakens the structure of democratic continuity,'' Matt Glassman, a political scientist, wrote in a series of \uc2 Twitter\uc2  messages this past week.\par \par \uc2 Contesting a presidential \uc2 election\uc2 , he said, risks turning bedrock democratic assumptions -- rule of law, the peaceful transfer of power, the sanctity of elections -- into points of political dispute.\par \par \uc2 But not all leaders execute this playbook consciously or with an eye toward some specific prize, said Nic Cheeseman, a political scientist at the University of Oxford who studies sub-Saharan Africa.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  might be less \uc2 Hugo Ch\u225\'00\'E1vez\uc2  than Julius Malema, he said, referring to a South African populist who challenged the legitimacy of elections this spring to save face after his party lost.\par \par \uc2 South African analysts have warned that Mr. Malema, whatever his intent, eroded popular faith in their country's democratic processes. Disturbing political violence followed in the weeks after, with riots in Pretoria and two members of Mr. Malema's party killed in Johannesburg.\par \par \uc2 Three factors shape whether accusations of \uc2 election\uc2 -rigging lead to violence, Mr. Cheeseman said: whether people consider political violence socially acceptable, the winning's side willingness to appease the loser with concessions and ''whether people genuinely, deep down, believe the \uc2 election\uc2  was rigged.''\par \par \uc2 The first of those three conditions is not present in the United States, which lacks the prevalent militia violence of weaker states, making large-scale violence extremely unlikely.\par \par \uc2 But the second works both for and against the United States: While Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's supporters do not have to fear political oppression if he loses, they cannot expect that he will be granted the vice presidency if they protest, which happened after Zimbabwe's elections in 2008. The third is unknowable. If those conditions are taken together, Mr. Cheeseman said, the outlook is not one of doom, but it is worrisome.\par \par \uc2 'I actually can't believe that it's happening here'\par \par \uc2 America's democratic norms make widespread unrest unlikely, Mr. Levitsky said. Still, because Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  has spent much of his campaign challenging the legitimacy of the \uc2 election\uc2 , should he refuse to concede a loss, that could be ''enough to provoke a fair amount of violence'' from fringe elements.\par \par \uc2 As he went on, Mr. Levitsky's language lapsed into a vernacular more commonly applied to very different sorts of countries: ''American security forces,'' he said, would need to move carefully to resolve any ''electoral violence.''\par \par \uc2 He conceded that it was uncomfortable to talk about the United States as if it were ''an authoritarian regime.''\par \par \uc2 It was one of many similar moments in recent conversations with political scientists, particularly those who are American but study faraway dictatorships and troubled states.\par \par \uc2 ''I actually can't believe all of the parallels. I actually can't believe that it's happening here,'' Erica Frantz, a political science professor at Michigan State University, recently told The Toronto Star, in one of a growing genre of articles, blogs and social media posts chronicling political scientists sounding the alarm.\par \par \uc2 ''Boy, is \uc2 Trump\uc2  giving those of us who study populism, fascism and the erosion of democratic norms ever more to think about,'' Ms. Berman said.\par \par \uc2 Brendan Nyhan\uc2 , a professor of government at Dartmouth College, has written that even if Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  refuses to concede and wins nothing for it, his example could ''encourage other losing candidates to challenge their own defeats, creating the risk of a more serious crisis of legitimacy in the future.''\par \par \uc2 ''We see in Africa the way it builds up historical resentments, people's sense that they cannot place faith in the system,'' Mr. Cheeseman said. Over time, he warned, people who hear this message can come to believe that they do not ''have a stake in the state'' or ''have a responsibility to obey the rule of law'' that they are told no longer exists.\par \par \uc2 ''When you start to delegitimize your system, including your electoral systems, your media and the police in different ways, then you start to have people genuinely questioning the value of the system,'' Mr. Cheeseman said. ''It takes a generation to rebuild that trust. This is not something that gets done in a year or two.''\par \par \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2  has claimed, without evidence, that the \uc2 election\uc2  will be ''rigged'' and ''taken away from us.'' Political scientists say this type of rhetoric erodes popular faith in democracy.

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 GOD should sue some of her supposed champions for defamation.\par \par \uc2 Some conservative evangelicals malign God by suggesting that Christians should scorn adoring same-sex couples yet vote for a sexual predator. They seem to slip seamlessly from ''love thy neighbor'' to acquiescing in the Gospel of Donald: Thou shalt ''grab them'' by the genitals.\par \par \uc2 Yet there's far more to the story, and liberals haven't given enough credit to the many conservative Christians who have made the wrenching decision to condemn Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  as the antithesis of the values they honor.\par \par \uc2 ''How could 'family values voters' support a man who had, among other things, stated openly that no man's wife was safe with him in the room?'' asked \uc2 R. Albert Mohler Jr\uc2 ., president of the Southern Baptist Theological Seminary, in an essay for The \uc2 Washington Post\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Marvin Olasky, the editor in chief of World, a conservative Christian magazine, called \uc2 Trump\uc2  ''unfit for power'' in an editorial. Wayne Grudem, an influential evangelical theologian, this month urged \uc2 Trump\uc2  to step aside.\par \par \uc2 A recent poll by LifeWay Research, which specializes in surveys of Christians, found that white Americans with evangelical beliefs overwhelmingly support \uc2 Trump\uc2  over \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , 65 percent to 10 percent. Yet even these figures indicate some abandonment of \uc2 Trump\uc2 : White evangelicals supported previous Republican nominees by even more lopsided figures.\par \par \uc2 The voting isn't just about theology, for nonwhite evangelicals (and there are many, plus some liberal white evangelicals) favor \uc2 Clinton\uc2  over \uc2 Trump\uc2  by almost the same margin.\par \par \uc2 Much of the public focus has been on prominent evangelicals, including \uc2 Jerry Falwell Jr\uc2 ., \uc2 Ralph Reed\uc2  and \uc2 James Dobson\uc2 , who are backing \uc2 Trump\uc2 . Yet it's striking how many others denounce him as utterly unacceptable.\par \par \uc2 ''Enthusiasm for a candidate like \uc2 Trump\uc2  gives our neighbors ample reason to doubt that we believe Jesus is Lord,'' Andy Crouch, the executive editor of Christianity Today, wrote in an essay.\par \par \uc2 The main reason many evangelicals still support \uc2 Trump\uc2 , holding their noses, is abortion. But \uc2 Deborah Fikes\uc2 , a prominent Texas evangelical, is among those wondering if Christians should broaden their agenda. ''Evangelicals are not living out the good news of the gospel as Jesus modeled and commanded when we prioritize criminalizing abortion as our single most important issue politically while neglecting issues of poverty or refugees,'' she told me.\par \par \uc2 More than 20,000 evangelicals have signed a petition on \uc2 Change.org\uc2  calling this \uc2 election\uc2  ''a significant teachable moment for our churches,'' adding, ''\uc2 Trump\uc2 's racial and religious bigotry and treatment of women is morally unacceptable to us as evangelical Christians.''\par \par \uc2 It's easy for secular Americans to dismiss all of this as too little too late -- but that would be exactly the wrong approach.\par \par \uc2 Yes, it has been infuriating to see blowhards who proclaimed themselves ''pro-life'' when their compassion for human beings seemed to end at birth. The grossest immorality of the 1980s did not unfold in gay bathhouses but among those who portrayed AIDS as God's punishment for gays -- ''human garbage,'' in the words of Anita Bryant -- in ways that slowed the health response and led vast numbers to die unnecessarily.\par \par \uc2 Yet too many secular liberals have moved from denouncing religious intolerance to embracing an irreligious intolerance of their own. Too often, liberals mock conservative Christians in ways that would outrage them if Jews, Muslims or others were the target. It is too often acceptable on liberal campuses to create a climate hostile and contemptuous of evangelicals -- and that, too, is bigotry.\par \par \uc2 It also misunderstands faith. In my reporting around the world, I've been awed by evangelical and Catholic missionary doctors risking their lives to ease suffering. And remember that it was evangelical pressure that led President George W. Bush to adopt a massive program to fight AIDS around the world, saving millions of lives and turning the tide of the disease.\par \par \uc2 Many young evangelicals seem tired of the culture wars, wearied by politics, and less interested in hounding gay couples than in helping the homeless, the addicted, the incarcerated. Evangelicals have done sterling work fighting prison rape and combating sex trafficking, and if secular bleeding hearts and religious bleeding hearts can just work together, so much more will be accomplished to improve the human condition.\par \par \uc2 I hope that the crisis among evangelicals this \uc2 election\uc2  year creates an opportunity to build bridges across America's ''God Gulf.'' As many prominent evangelicals renounce \uc2 Trump\uc2 , the secular response should be to applaud that courage in hopes that this is a turning point, and that people of good will, regardless of where they stand on the faith spectrum, can begin to move from fighting one another to tackling the common enemies of humanity that plague us all.\par \par \uc2 I invite you to sign up for my free, twice-weekly email newsletter.

Maybe Not This Time.\b0\par\par\uc2 By ROBERT FRANK \par \uc2 1,210 \uc2 words\par \uc2 23 October 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 3\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 For the first time in decades, the wealthy are set to deliver a landslide victory for a Democratic presidential candidate.\par \par \uc2 While polling data on the rich is imprecise given their small population, polls of the top-earning households favor \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  over \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2  two to one. The July Affluent Barometer survey by Ipsos found that among voters earning more than $100,000 a year -- roughly the top 25 percent of households -- 45 percent said they planned to vote for Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , while 28 percent planned to vote for Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 . The rest were undecided or planned to vote for another candidate.\par \par \uc2 The spread was even wider among the highest earners. For those earning $250,000 or more -- roughly the top 5 percent of households -- 53 percent planned to vote for Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  while 25 percent favored Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 . The survey's margin of error was plus or minus four points.\par \par \uc2 It is unclear whether those patterns have changed since July. But if the numbers hold, historians and wealth experts say that next month's elections may prove to be the largest vote by the wealthy for a Democratic candidate in recent history.\par \par \uc2 ''This would be a big deal, and fundamentally different from what we've seen before,'' said Andrew Gelman, professor of statistics and political science at Columbia University and co-author of the book ''Red State, Blue State, Rich State, Poor State: Why Americans Vote the Way They Do.''\par \par \uc2 The big question is whether Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's potential sweep of the elite represents a structural shift in the politics and policy preferences of the wealthy, or simply a personal aversion to Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 . Either way, the vote would break decades of Republican dominance of affluent voters in presidential elections. It would also shed light on a growing debate about whether the wealthy are tacking to the left politically as more fortunes are created and concentrated in states like California and New York and throughout the left-leaning tech industry.\par \par \uc2 ''\uc2 Trump\uc2  could be an aberration,'' Mr. Gelman said. ''Or this could be part of a political realignment. We probably won't know for years.''\par \par \uc2 Ipsos\uc2  says its data suggests that the affluent are more anti-\uc2 Trump\uc2  than pro-\uc2 Clinton\uc2 . In the spring, Democratic-leaning voters making more than $100,000 were split evenly between Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  and Bernie Sanders. Republican-leaning affluent voters were split evenly among Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , Ted Cruz and \uc2 Marco Rubio\uc2 . By the end of the summer, Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  had picked up nearly all of the Sanders-leaning affluent voters, while Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  failed to win as many of the Cruz and Rubio voters.\par \par \uc2 ''The affluent vote seems to be more about the concerns over \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  than the enthusiasm for \uc2 Clinton\uc2 ,'' said Stephen Kraus, chief insights officer and director of the Ipsos Affluent Survey.\par \par \uc2 Since the 1950s, with few exceptions, upper-income voters have leaned more Republican than the broader population. In a study of national elections, Mr. Gelman found that ''census and opinion poll data since 1952 reveal that higher-income voters continue to support the Republicans in presidential elections.''\par \par \uc2 Mr. Gelman said the wealthy naturally favored policies that favor them, and Republican staples like lower taxes and smaller government were preferable than larger government and redistribution of wealth. ''They support policies that benefit their group, because in their view, those are the best policies and best ideas,'' he said.\par \par \uc2 If the wealthy voted according to their pocketbooks, their choice for president would be clear.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  has pledged to cut the federal income taxes of the top 1 percent by more than 25 percent, allowing them to keep an extra $215,000 each year, according to the \uc2 Tax Policy Center\uc2 . He would eliminate the estate tax, reduce regulations, cut the capital-gains tax rate and create a special, superlow tax rate for some business owners.\par \par \uc2 Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , by contrast, would make the top 1 percent pay an average of $117,000 more a year while superearners in the top 0.1 percent would see their taxes go up more than $800,000 a year. She would also increase taxes on certain capital gains, limit loopholes used by the wealthy and target dynastic wealth with a steeper estate tax.\par \par \uc2 In recent decades, there is evidence that wealthier voters have been leaning more Republican. In 1956 and 1960, the share of Republican-identified voters in the top income quintile ''was only slightly higher in the highest than in the lowest quintile,'' Mr. Gelman said. By 2000, those at the top were more than twice as likely to identify as Republican than those at the bottom, according to Mr. Gelman's study.\par \par \uc2 The closest comparison to the current \uc2 election\uc2  among affluent voters is the one in 2008, when \uc2 Barack Obama\uc2  carried about half of voters who earned more than $100,000. Yet Mr. Gelman said \uc2 John McCain\uc2  still did better among the rich than the poor, and compared with the broader electorate, the wealthy voted Republican more often.\par \par \uc2 In the current \uc2 election\uc2 , Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  is poised to capture a far larger share of the affluent vote than Mr. Obama. And if the numbers hold, the elite would lean more Democratic than Republican for the first time in at least 50 years, Mr. Gelman said.\par \par \uc2 Among the rich and superrich, the politics are more divided. In the run-up to the 2012 \uc2 election\uc2 , 61 percent of millionaire voters (those with investable assets of $1 million or more) supported the Republican nominee, \uc2 Mitt Romney\uc2 , according to a survey from the \uc2 Spectrem Group\uc2 . In the 2008 \uc2 election\uc2 , while more than three-quarters of millionaire families favored Mr. McCain, two-thirds of families worth $30 million or more supported Mr. Obama.\par \par \uc2 Some argue that the rich have become more Democratic because many of the richest states, like California, New York, Connecticut and Maryland are blue. Yet Mr. Gelman's research shows that while rich states lean more Democratic, affluent voters still lean more Republican.\par \par \uc2 ''The Republicans have the support of the richer voters within any given state but have more overall support in the poorer states,'' Mr. Gelman said. ''Thus, the identification of rich states with rich voters, or more generally, the personification of so-called red and blue states, is misleading.''\par \par \uc2 In the current \uc2 election\uc2 , of course, neither candidate is publicly courting the wealth vote. Even Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  has been labeled a populist. Yet affluent voters are 15 to 20 percent more likely to vote than the broader population, according to Ipsos. Their financial support gives the wealthy an outsize voice in campaigns.\par \par \uc2 ''I don't think either candidate wants to be seen as having the support of the 1 percent right now,'' Mr. Kraus said, ''even though they are both part of the 1 percent.''\par \par \uc2 Robert Frank is CNBC wealth editor and the author of ''Richistan.''\par \par \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2  and Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  on Oct. 19 in Las Vegas at the third presidential debate. A survey from July said that 45 percent of those earning more than $100,000 a year favored Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , while 28 percent planned to vote for Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 .

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Six years after a Supreme Court decision opened vast new channels for money to flow into national elections, Democrats have built the largest and best-coordinated apparatus of outside groups operating in the 2016 presidential campaign, defying expectations that conservative and corporate wealth would dominate the race.\par \par \uc2 A dozen different organizations raised over $200 million through the beginning of October and since May have spent more than $110 million on television, digital, and radio ads in support of \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , according to records filed with the \uc2 Federal \uc2 Election\uc2  Commission\uc2  through Thursday.\par \par \uc2 The handful of organizations backing \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2  have raised less than half that amount, a steep dive from four years ago, when wealthy Republicans poured hundreds of millions of dollars into groups backing the Republican nominee \uc2 Mitt Romney\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 The Democrats' success this year reflects, in part, Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's close personal ties to her party's elite donors and her allies' willingness to exploit the 2010 ruling in the \uc2 Citizens United\uc2  case far more aggressively than President Obama did.\par \par \uc2 But the Democrats are also deeply indebted to one man: Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , whose provocations and tirades -- along with a loud crusade against his own party's donors -- have virtually shut off what once promised to be a half-billion-dollar spigot of outside money.\par \par \uc2 ''Everyone thought that we would be outspent, that there would be significant operations built at the presidential level for the other candidate,'' said Guy Cecil, a former \uc2 Clinton\uc2  aide who heads Priorities USA Action, the main hub of big Democratic giving. ''That obviously hasn't happened.''\par \par \uc2 The biggest groups set up or expanded by conservatives since \uc2 Citizens United\uc2  -- including American Crossroads, founded by Karl Rove, and the network overseen by Charles G. and \uc2 David H. Koch\uc2  -- are absent from the presidential campaign, focusing instead on protecting Republicans in Congress.\par \par \uc2 ''Unlike President Obama four years ago, \uc2 Clinton\uc2  embraced the outside money game and shrewdly empowered a single group to carry her message,'' said Steven J. Law, the president of American Crossroads and its sister organizations, ''in contrast to the boardwalk arcade of groups supporting \uc2 Trump\uc2 .''\par \par \uc2 Citizens United\uc2  paved the way for independent groups that could raise unlimited amounts of money from unions, corporations, and wealthy individuals to spend on elections, as long as they did not coordinate with individual candidates or parties. Republican donors moved quickly to seize on the ruling, pouring hundreds of millions of dollars into the last three national elections, while Democrats struggled to persuade their donors to invest in ''super PACs'' at the same scale.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's rivals for the Republican nomination were backed by an array of super PACs and outside groups set up by their allies and former aides, seeming to set the stage for even greater spending in 2016. But Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  unexpectedly triumphed, exploiting his knack for free publicity and relying on his own fortune and money from grass-roots supporters. In part because of that success, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  was slow to incorporate super PACs into his general \uc2 election\uc2  strategy.\par \par \uc2 By contrast, Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  began personally courting donors for outside groups almost as soon as she entered the campaign in spring 2015.\par \par \uc2 The Democrats' tentpole is Priorities USA, a five-year-old super PAC that has access to the party's biggest donors and the implicit blessing of Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , and is now on track to raise $173 million by \uc2 Election\uc2  Day. That is more than any equivalent Democratic effort in history, including the controversial big-money groups set up by wealthy liberals a decade ago to unseat President George W. Bush. The PAC is closely coordinating with environmental and labor activists and other organizations set up to harness support from veterans, African-Americans and Latinos.\par \par \uc2 In twice-monthly meetings at a Democratic law firm in downtown Washington, officials at Priorities have convened representatives of a dozen super PACs and progressive organizations to carve out swing-state turf and share intelligence from organizers on the ground. Several have pooled money with Priorities USA to purchase television and digital advertising through the same media firms, allowing smaller groups to get better rates. (Other left-leaning organizations, including labor unions and a super PAC founded by the billionaire environmentalist \uc2 Tom Steyer\uc2 , have separately spent significant money on field organizing.)\par \par \uc2 Priorities USA has shared the cost of some major campaigns with Emily's List, the leading progressive group aimed at electing Democratic women. The super PAC has also given smaller groups access to its digital and video creative studio or shared its own television spots with other organizations to run under their own names.\par \par \uc2 In early October, for example, a super PAC controlled by the \uc2 Service Employees International Union\uc2  began a $3 million Spanish-language campaign targeted at Latino voters in southern Florida and Nevada. The ads, which featured Hispanic families and accused Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  of bringing ''hate, divisiveness and disrespect into our homes,'' was originally produced by a team at Priorities USA.\par \par \uc2 Democratic officials said the partnership had yielded better and more authentic advertising and outreach. A group called the Latino Victory Fund, which has run $400,000 in advertising backed by Priorities, advised the group on how to vary voice-over accents depending on where the ad was running: Cuban-inflected Spanish for spots airing around Miami, Mexican-American accents and word usage for Nevada.\par \par \uc2 ''Sometimes we've come up with concepts for ads, both digital and television,'' said the fund's interim director, C\u233\'00\'E9sar J. Blanco. ''In other instances, Priorities has developed a concept and shared it with us. They've shared with us data and polling. It's been a really great partnership.''\par \par \uc2 Behind that partnership is an astonishing concentration of liberal wealth. More than two-thirds of the total money that groups supporting Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  have raised -- $133 million -- comes from just 30 families.\par \par \uc2 Donald Sussman, a hedge fund investor and longtime liberal donor, has donated $19 million to Priorities USA, among the largest amounts any left-leaning donor has ever given to a single super PAC. Members of the billionaire Pritzker family, which founded the \uc2 Hyatt\uc2  hotel chain, have contributed $14 million to Priorities and other pro-\uc2 Clinton\uc2  groups. The liberal billionaire philanthropist \uc2 George Soros\uc2  has given $13.5 million, far more than he gave to support Mr. Obama four years ago.\par \par \uc2 As most of the big Republican groups have stayed away from the presidential race, a small constellation of groups run by \uc2 Trump\uc2  allies has sprung up in their place, raising $46 million since the beginning of the cycle.\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 National Rifle Association\uc2 , one of the few traditional conservative allies to get behind Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's campaign, has put $20 million into a super PAC supporting Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  and other Republicans. But many of the new \uc2 Trump\uc2  groups are getting into the game late, when advertising rates have skyrocketed, and they are competing against one another for donors and turf, sometimes even cannibalizing Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's own fund-raising.\par \par \uc2 Another group, Future45, has raised $13 million for ads criticizing Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , and an affiliated nonprofit group that does not disclose its donors has drawn millions more. But their spending appears targeted at states with competitive Senate races, with the goal of protecting Republicans down the ballot from any damage Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  might do.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  has attracted some generous individual supporters, according to disclosures filed with the \uc2 Federal \uc2 Election\uc2  Commission\uc2  through last week. The casino magnate \uc2 Sheldon Adelson\uc2  and his wife, Miriam, have donated $10 million to groups running advertising against Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 . Bernard Marcus, the co-founder of Home Depot, has provided $7 million to a pair of pro-\uc2 Trump\uc2  super PACs.\par \par \uc2 A surprisingly small donor to Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  is \uc2 Robert Mercer\uc2 , a New York hedge fund executive. Mr. Mercer and his family have invested millions of dollars over the years in conservative advocacy groups and media outlets, some of which are now among Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's biggest supporters. But Mr. Mercer has been relatively parsimonious with the cash he has put into a Mercer-controlled super PAC supporting Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , contributing just $2 million.\par \par \uc2 Find out what you need to know about the 2016 presidential race today, and get politics news updates via \uc2 Facebook\uc2 , \uc2 Twitter\uc2  and the First Draft newsletter.\par \par \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  in Cleveland on Friday. Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's close personal ties to elite donors have helped in fund-raising efforts.

\par\par \uc2 OP-ED COLUMNIST\par \uc2 Sunday Review Desk; SECTSR\par \b \uc2 The Dangers of \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\b0\par\par\uc2 By ROSS DOUTHAT \par \uc2 902 \uc2 words\par \uc2 23 October 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 11\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 A VOTE for \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  over \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2 , the \uc2 Clinton\uc2  campaign has suggested in broad ways and subtle ones, isn't just a vote for a Democrat over a Republican: It's a vote for safety over risk, steady competence over boastful recklessness, psychological stability in the White House over ungovernable passions.\par \par \uc2 This theme has been a winning one for Hillary, in her debates and in the wider campaign, and for good reason. The perils of a \uc2 Trump\uc2  presidency are as distinctive as the candidate himself, and a vote for \uc2 Trump\uc2  makes a long list of worst cases -- the Western alliance system's unraveling, a cycle of domestic radicalization, an accidental economic meltdown, a civilian-military crisis -- more likely than with any normal administration.\par \par \uc2 Indeed, \uc2 Trump\uc2  and his supporters almost admit as much. ''We've tried sane, now let's try crazy,'' is basically his campaign's working motto. The promise to be a bull in a china shop is part of his demagogue's appeal. Some of his more eloquent supporters have analogized a vote for \uc2 Trump\uc2  to storming the cockpit of a hijacked plane, with the likelihood of a plane crash entirely factored in.\par \par \uc2 But passing on the plane-crash candidate doesn't mean ignoring the dangers of his rival.\par \par \uc2 The dangers of a Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  presidency are more familiar than \uc2 Trump\uc2 's authoritarian unknowns, because we live with them in our politics already. They're the dangers of elite groupthink, of Beltway power worship, of a cult of presidential action in the service of dubious ideals. They're the dangers of a recklessness and radicalism that doesn't recognize itself as either, because it's convinced that if an idea is mainstream and commonplace among the great and good then it cannot possibly be folly.\par \par \uc2 Almost every crisis that has come upon the West in the last 15 years has its roots in this establishmentarian type of folly. The Iraq War, which liberals prefer to remember as a conflict conjured by a neoconservative cabal, was actually the work of a bipartisan interventionist consensus, pushed hard by George W. Bush but embraced as well by a large slice of center-left opinion that included \uc2 Tony Blair\uc2  and more than half of Senate Democrats.\par \par \uc2 Likewise the financial crisis: Whether you blame financial-services deregulation or happy-go-lucky housing policy (or both), the policies that helped inflate and pop the bubble were embraced by both wings of the political establishment. Likewise with the euro, the European common currency, a terrible idea that only cranks and Little Englanders dared oppose until the Great Recession exposed it as a potentially economy-sinking folly. Likewise with Angela Merkel's grand and reckless open-borders gesture just last year: She was the heroine of a thousand profiles even as she delivered her continent to polarization and violence.\par \par \uc2 This record of elite folly -- which doesn't even include lesser case studies like our splendid little war in Libya -- is a big part of why the United States has a ''let's try crazy'' candidate in this \uc2 election\uc2 , and why there are so many Trumpian parties thriving on European soil.\par \par \uc2 One can look at \uc2 Trump\uc2  himself and see too much danger of still-deeper disaster, too much temperamental risk and moral turpitude, to be an acceptable alternative to this blunder-ridden status quo ... while also looking at \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  and seeing a woman whose record embodies the tendencies that gave rise to Trumpism in the first place.\par \par \uc2 Indeed what is distinctive about \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , more even than Bush or Obama, is how few examples there are of her ever breaking with the elite consensus on matters of statecraft.\par \par \uc2 She was for the Iraq War when everyone was for it, against the surge when everyone had given up on Iraq, and then an unchastened liberal hawk again in Libya just a few short years later.\par \par \uc2 She was a Russia dove when the media mocked Mitt Romney for being a Russia hawk; now she's a Russia hawk along with everyone else in Washington in a moment that might require de-escalation.\par \par \uc2 She cites Merkel as a model leader, she's surrounded by a bipartisan foreign policy cadre that's eager for a Details To Be Determined escalation in Syria, and she seems -- like her \uc2 Goldman Sachs\uc2  audiences -- intent on sailing serenely above the storm of nationalism rather than reconsidering any of the assumptions of her class.\par \par \uc2 The good news is that she is not a utopian; she is -- or has become, across a long and grinding career -- temperamentally pragmatic, self-consciously hardheaded. So she is unlikely to do anything that the cosmopolitan capitals of Europe and America would consider obviously radical or dangerous or dumb.\par \par \uc2 But in those cases where the cosmopolitan position isn't necessarily reasonable or safe, in those instances where the Western elite can go half-mad without realizing it, \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  shows every sign of being just as ready to march into folly as her peers.\par \par \uc2 I invite you to follow me on Twitter (@DouthatNYT).\par \par \uc2 Follow The \uc2 New York Times\uc2  Opinion section on \uc2 Facebook\uc2  and Twitter (@NYTopinion), and sign up for the Opinion Today newsletter.\par \par \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  after her arrival in Cleveland for campaign appearances on Friday. She was scheduled to speak in Pittsburgh and Philadelphia on Saturday.

\par\par \uc2 National Desk; SECTA\par \b \uc2 When Crib Monitors Double as Web Weaponry\b0\par\par\uc2 By DAVID E. SANGER and NICOLE PERLROTH; David E. Sanger reported from Washington, and Nicole Perlroth from San Francisco. \par \uc2 1,368 \uc2 words\par \uc2 23 October 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 1\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 WASHINGTON -- When surveillance cameras began popping up in the 1970s and '80s, they were welcomed as a crime-fighting tool, then as a way to monitor traffic congestion, factory floors and even baby cribs. Later, they were adopted for darker purposes, as authoritarian governments like China's used them to prevent challenges to power by keeping tabs on protesters and dissidents.\par \par \uc2 But now those cameras -- and many other devices that today are connected to the internet -- have been commandeered for an entirely different purpose: as a weapon of mass disruption. The internet slowdown that swept the East Coast on Friday, when many Americans were already jittery about the possibility that hackers could interfere with \uc2 election\uc2  systems, offered a glimpse of a new era of vulnerabilities confronting a highly connected society.\par \par \uc2 The attack on the infrastructure of the internet, which made it all but impossible at times to check \uc2 Twitter\uc2  feeds or headlines, was a remarkable reminder about how billions of ordinary web-connected devices -- many of them highly insecure -- can be turned to vicious purposes. And the threats will continue long after \uc2 Election\uc2  Day for a nation that increasingly keeps its data in the cloud and has oftentimes kept its head in the sand.\par \par \uc2 Remnants of the attack continued to slow some sites on Saturday, though the biggest troubles had abated. Still, to the tech community, Friday's events were as inevitable as an earthquake along the San Andreas fault. A new kind of malicious software exploits a long-known vulnerability in those cameras and other cheap devices that are now joining up to what has become known as the internet of things.\par \par \uc2 The advantage of putting every device on the internet is obvious. It means your refrigerator can order you milk when you are running low, and the printer on your home network can tell a retailer that you need more ink. Security cameras can alert your cellphone when someone is walking up the driveway, whether it is a delivery worker or a burglar. When \uc2 Google\uc2  and the Detroit automakers get their driverless cars on the road, the internet of things will become your chauffeur.\par \par \uc2 But hundreds of thousands, and maybe millions, of those security cameras and other devices have been infected with a fairly simple program that guessed at their factory-set passwords -- often ''admin'' or ''12345'' or even, yes, ''password'' -- and, once inside, turned them into an army of simple robots. Each one was commanded, at a coordinated time, to bombard a small company in Manchester, N.H., called Dyn DNS with messages that overloaded its circuits.\par \par \uc2 Few have heard of Dyn, but it essentially acts as one of the internet's giant switchboards. Bring it to a halt, and the problems spread instantly. It did not take long to reduce \uc2 Twitter\uc2 , Reddit and \uc2 Airbnb\uc2  -- as well as the news feeds of The \uc2 New York Times\uc2  -- to a crawl.\par \par \uc2 The culprit is unclear, and it may take days or weeks to detect it. In the end, though, the answer probably does not mean much anyway.\par \par \uc2 The vulnerability the country woke up to on Friday morning can be easily exploited by a nation-state such as Russia, which the Obama administration has blamed for hacking into the \uc2 Democratic National Committee\uc2  and the accounts of \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's campaign officials. It could also be exploited by a criminal group, which was the focus of much of the guesswork about Friday's attack, or even by teenagers. The opportunities for copycats are endless.\par \par \uc2 The starkest warning came in mid-September from Bruce Schneier, an internet security expert, who posted a brief essay titled ''Someone Is Learning How to Take Down the Internet.'' The technique was hardly news: Entities like the North Korean government and extortionists have long used ''distributed denial-of-service'' attacks to direct a flood of data at sites they do not like.\par \par \uc2 ''If the attacker has a bigger fire hose of data than the defender has,'' he wrote, ''the attacker wins.''\par \par \uc2 But in recent times, hackers have been exploring the vulnerabilities of the companies that make up the backbone of the internet -- just as states recently saw examinations of the systems that hold their voter registration rolls. Attacks on the companies escalated, Mr. Schneier wrote, ''as if the attack were looking for the exact point of failure.'' Think of the mighty Maginot Line, tested again and again by the German Army in 1940, until it found the weak point and rolled into Paris.\par \par \uc2 The difference with the internet is that it is not clear in the United States who is supposed to be protecting it. The network does not belong to the government -- or really to anyone. Instead, every organization is responsible for defending its own little piece. Banks, retailers and social media hubs are supposed to invest in protecting their websites, but that does not help much if the connections among them are severed.\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 Department of Homeland Security\uc2  is supposed to provide the baseline of internet defense for the United States, but it is constantly playing catch-up. In recent weeks, it deployed teams to the states to help them find and patch vulnerabilities in their voter registration systems and their networks for reporting results.\par \par \uc2 The F.B.I. investigates breaches, but that takes time -- and, in the meantime, people want to bank online and stream television shows. On Nov. 8, Americans will have to look up where they are supposed to vote, and, in a few cases, they will cast their votes on the internet. Yet the voting system is not considered part of the nation's ''critical infrastructure.''\par \par \uc2 The head of the \uc2 National Security Agency\uc2 , Adm. Michael Rogers, said recently that experts were looking at the problem the wrong way. ''We are over-focused on places and things,'' he said in a talk at Harvard. ''We need to focus on the data,'' and how it flows -- or doesn't flow.\par \par \uc2 That is where the internet of things comes in. Most of the devices have been hooked up to the web over the past few years with little concern for security. Cheap parts, some coming from Chinese suppliers, have weak or no password protections, and it is not obvious how to change those passwords.\par \par \uc2 And the problem is quickly expanding: \uc2 Cisco\uc2  estimates that the number of such devices could reach 50 billion by 2020, from 15 billion today. \uc2 Intel\uc2  puts the number at roughly 200 billion devices in the same time frame. (Assuming the global population is around 7.7 billion people in 2020, that would be about six to 26 devices per person.)\par \par \uc2 Security researchers have been warning of this problem for years, but that caution has largely been written off as hype or fear-mongering. Then Brian Krebs, who runs a popular site on internet security, was struck by a significant attack a few weeks ago. The company protecting him, Akamai, gave up. The malware behind the attack, called Mirai, had a built-in dictionary of common passwords and used them to hijack devices to become attackers.\par \par \uc2 Chester Wisniewski\uc2 , a principal computer research scientist at Sophos, a security company, said that attacks like the one on Dyn ''might be the beginning of a new era of internet attacks conducted via 'smart' things.''\par \par \uc2 ''There are tens of millions more insecure 'smart' things that could cause incredible disruptions, if harnessed,'' Mr. Wisniewski added in an email.\par \par \uc2 It is possible, investigators say, that the attack on Dyn was conducted by a criminal group that wanted to extort the company. Or it could have been done by ''hacktivists.'' Or a foreign power that wanted to remind the United States of its vulnerability. The answer may not come by \uc2 Election\uc2  Day, but the next wave of attacks very well could.\par \par \uc2 Devices like surveillance cameras are vulnerable to hackers.

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 GETTYSBURG, Pa. -- \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2  came to this historic battlefield town Saturday to offer his vision for America's future, saying he hoped to ''heal the divisions'' of the country as President Lincoln tried to do here seven score and 13 years ago.\par \par \uc2 Yet in his own Gettysburg address, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , who has been sliding in the polls less than three weeks before \uc2 Election\uc2  Day, did not offer much in the way of race-changing oratory and did not seem to embrace Lincoln's unifying ambition.\par \par \uc2 Instead, the Republican nominee used the first third of what had been promoted as a ''closing argument'' speech to nurse personal grievances, grumbling about ''the rigging of this \uc2 election\uc2 '' and ''the dishonest mainstream media,'' and threatening to sue the women who have come forward -- an 11th woman did on Saturday -- to accuse him of aggressive sexual advances.\par \par \uc2 ''Every woman lied when they came forward to hurt my campaign -- total fabrication,'' Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  said. ''The events never happened. Never. All of these liars will be sued after the \uc2 election\uc2  is over.''\par \par \uc2 And the more substantive part of the speech, intended to outline his first 100 days in office if he were elected president, did not quite live up to its billing by campaign aides, who had promised a major policy address not unlike \uc2 Newt Gingrich\uc2 's 1994 ''Contract with America.'' Instead, a subdued Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  -- who on Friday acknowledged the possibility of electoral defeat -- largely repeated his existing campaign promises, from renegotiating trade deals to enforcing tougher immigration laws.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's carefully scripted presentation on Saturday was meant to project a new level of forethought and seriousness from a man not usually associated with either. His proposals had legislative titles like the ''Affordable Child Care and Elder Care Act'' and the ''Repeal and Replace Obamacare Act.''\par \par \uc2 The speech, before a small, handpicked crowd, was also a recognition that Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  needs to establish himself as someone with the discipline and temperament to lead the nation. ''\uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  is not running against me, she's running against change,'' he said. ''And she's running against all of the American people and all of the American voters.''\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  did offer specific immigration proposals, including an ''End Illegal Immigration Act'' that would establish mandatory minimum prison sentences for undocumented immigrants caught illegally re-entering the country after deportation. He also said he would stop issuing visas to any country that refused to take in citizens ordered deported from the United States, a policy that would almost certainly disrupt immigration and commerce with China, which is one such country.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  also reiterated his promise to build a border wall with Mexico and have Mexico pay for it, though he hedged a bit, saying, ''the country of Mexico will be reimbursing the United States for the full cost of such a wall.'' (At a rally in Cleveland later on Saturday, his most energetic of the day, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  was back to leading his crowd in chants calling for Mexico to pay for the wall.)\par \par \uc2 Repeating earlier pledges to ''drain the swamp'' in Washington, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  promised to push through a series of new ethics laws, as well as term limits for both the House and Senate. And he called for ''a hiring freeze on all federal employees to reduce the federal work force through attrition, exempting military, public safety and public health.''\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  has a long history of threatening and occasionally following though on litigation, and in raising the possibility of suing his female accusers, he may have simply been trying to stop more from coming forward.\par \par \uc2 At a news conference on Saturday in Los Angeles, Jessica Drake, an adult film actress, claimed that, after meeting Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  at a 2006 charity golf event in Lake Tahoe, Nev., she had accepted an invitation to meet in his hotel room. Not wanting to go alone, Ms. Drake said she was accompanied by a couple of female friends.\par \par \uc2 Ms. Drake, who appeared Saturday with the women's rights lawyer Gloria Allred, said Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  had hugged and kissed her and the other women without permission.\par \par \uc2 After returning to her room, Ms. Drake said, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  or a man phoning on his behalf offered her $10,000 to return to his room, which she declined.\par \par \uc2 In a statement, the \uc2 Trump\uc2  campaign called the accusation ''another example of the \uc2 Clinton\uc2  campaign trying to rig the \uc2 election\uc2 .''\par \par \uc2 ''Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  does not know this person, does not remember this person and would have no interest in ever knowing her,'' it said.\par \par \uc2 Aboard her campaign plane, Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  said: ''I saw where our opponent, \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2 , went to Gettysburg, one of the most extraordinary places in American history, and basically said if he's president he'll spend his time suing women who have made charges against him based on his behavior.''\par \par \uc2 She added, ''I'm going to keep talking about what we want to do, what we think the country deserves from the next president and vice president, and when it comes right down to it, I think that's what people are going to vote on.''\par \par \uc2 At her rally Saturday in Pennsylvania, Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  devoted much of her remarks to the state's contentious Senate race, giving an extended plug to the Democratic candidate, Katie McGinty, and attacking the Republican incumbent, Senator Patrick J. Toomey, for not denouncing Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  for his vulgar remarks about women captured in a recording.\par \par \uc2 A Bloomberg News poll conducted this month after the release of the tape showed Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  with a nine percentage point lead over Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  in Pennsylvania. On Saturday, she tried to offer an olive branch to the white working-class voters there who have gravitated to Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 ''You probably know people who are thinking about voting for \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2 ,'' she told the crowd of 1,800 gathered in a high school gymnasium. ''Here's what I want you to tell them: Tell them that I understand they need a president who cares about them, will listen to them, and I want to be their president, too.''\par \par \uc2 After his appearance in Gettysburg, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  reverted to his trusted stump speech in back-to-back rallies in Virginia Beach and Cleveland, exciting large crowds by attacking Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  and promising to bring back jobs.\par \par \uc2 ''You're going to look back at this rally and you're going to remember it for the rest of your life because this will be the beginning,'' he said in Virginia. ''You're going to remember Nov. 8 because your country is going to be a country that starts winning again.''\par \par \uc2 Find out what you need to know about the 2016 presidential race today, and get politics news updates via \uc2 Facebook\uc2 , \uc2 Twitter\uc2  and the First Draft newsletter.\par \par \uc2 Thomas Willard and his sons, Ben, 13, left, and Andrew, 9, in Gettysburg, Pa., on Saturday.

\par\par \uc2 OP-ED COLUMNIST\par \uc2 Editorial Desk; SECTSR\par \b \uc2 The Media's Moment of Truth\b0\par\par\uc2 By FRANK BRUNI \par \uc2 1,182 \uc2 words\par \uc2 23 October 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 3\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 The media's responsibility for \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2 's political success will be debated for a good long while, with the network honcho Les Moonves's words about \uc2 Trump\uc2 's candidacy (''It may not be good for America, but it's damn good for \uc2 CBS\uc2 '') front and center. But almost from the moment that \uc2 Trump\uc2  entered the 2016 presidential race, he has been a justifiably huge story. A lead in the polls became a lead in the delegate count and then, surreally, the nomination of the Republican Party.\par \par \uc2 Was he ridiculous? Beyond measure. Relevant? Beyond doubt. As long as the reporting about him was skeptical -- and, after a certain point, the bulk of it was -- there was more reason to train the spotlight on him than to pull it away.\par \par \uc2 That's about to change -- bigly. He is bound to lose the \uc2 election\uc2 , and we in the media will lose the rationale that his every utterance warrants notice as a glimpse into the character of a person in contention for the most consequential job in the world.\par \par \uc2 But he will remain the same attention-whoring, head-turning carnival act that he is today. And we will face a moment of truth: Do we care chiefly about promoting constructive discussion and protecting this blessed, beleaguered democracy of ours? Or are we more interested in groveling for eyeballs and clicks?\par \par \uc2 Just as \uc2 Trump\uc2  is a candidate like no other, he may be a test like none before him.\par \par \uc2 Mitt Romney didn't cause any ruckus after his defeat four years ago, and even if he had, he was Mitt Romney: a decent man and an able public servant but hardly box-office gold. He moved on. So did we.\par \par \uc2 The situation was much the same with \uc2 John McCain\uc2  in 2008, John Kerry in 2004 and Al Gore in 2000. Once they had definitively lost their bids for the presidency, they no longer asserted any claim to center stage, and none had lifted the media's fortunes to a point where letting go of him could be seen as a financial risk. \uc2 Trump\uc2  has been a singular boon and singularly potent drug.\par \par \uc2 We need rules for quitting him, guidelines for the circumstances in which coverage of him is legitimate and those in which it isn't. That distinction is all the more crucial because he seems poised to undermine important institutions and the democratic process itself. We can lend that effort more credibility or less by paying rapt attention to it or not.\par \par \uc2 The closest contemporary antecedent to \uc2 Trump\uc2  is \uc2 Sarah Palin\uc2 . As McCain's running mate in 2008, she attained a loopy celebrity that transcended both the campaign and politics, and the appetite for her -- in the media and the electorate -- didn't wane after \uc2 Election\uc2  Day. Nor did her zest for notice. She kept venturing out in various ways, and there were various signs that she'd become a symbol and a spokeswoman for a sizable political constituency. We didn't quit her.\par \par \uc2 But she never loomed as large as \uc2 Trump\uc2  does, and her reach was abridged in ways that his might not be. She didn't have, around her, the sorts of advisers and ready-made media machine that \uc2 Trump\uc2  has assembled, especially since he brought Breitbart News' Stephen Bannon onboard. She didn't have \uc2 Trump\uc2 's money. She didn't have his decades of practice at manipulating journalists.\par \par \uc2 He's already teeing up a stunt: his possible rejection of the \uc2 election\uc2  returns. How much should we indulge this tantrum, and for how long? If \uc2 Trump\uc2  actually marshals the necessary strategy and resources for legal challenges in states where the results allow them -- if he hires lawyers and files paperwork -- that's an indisputably newsworthy development. If he simply rages? That's not.\par \par \uc2 He may well be using this campaign as a pivot into a new media venture, which would be a bona fide business story. But it would not be an excuse to record his every insult or attend to his nonstop naysaying about politics and government.\par \par \uc2 His perspective will continue to matter -- within limits -- if there's proof that he's commanding a real political movement: rallies, infrastructure, the cultivation of candidates in his mold. Without such evidence, he's merely what The Weekly Standard's Jay Cost branded him last week: the windbag in winter.\par \par \uc2 Maybe the media will be spared any tough decisions by \uc2 Trump\uc2  himself. He could go gentle into that good night (hey, stranger things have happened). Or he may have finally exhausted the curiosity and patience of all but a tiny fraction of Americans, so that journalists have no economic incentive to stick with him.\par \par \uc2 The greatest power resides with the audience -- which bears much of the culpability, too. Never before have news organizations been able to judge so quickly and accurately what our consumers respond to. If those consumers hadn't demonstrated such intense interest in \uc2 Trump\uc2 , we probably wouldn't have, either. And if they turn from \uc2 Trump\uc2 , they can be sure that most of us will, too, without much equivocation or delay.\par \par \uc2 But we can't place all of this on their doorstep. There are adjustments we should make, regardless of metrics.\par \par \uc2 One is tonal. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's mendacity, viciousness, vulgarity and lack of preparation encouraged a kind of political journalism that wasn't just adversarial but outraged, urgent, mocking -- and rightly so. An uncommon peril called for an uncommon approach. The pitch of the commentary had to match the peculiarity of the moment. But that style can't become the new normal, not in a country that's already this polarized. We should dial it down after \uc2 Trump\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 And if he remains catnip to readers and viewers? We should show some courage and restraint.\par \par \uc2 Yes, it's an economic necessity -- a matter of survival -- that we mingle popular fare with more important stuff, using the former to fund the latter: pet videos for Pentagon reporting; a Kardashian for a Khamenei. But \uc2 Trump\uc2  isn't harmless fodder, not if his words and actions after the campaign match those during it. He has the potential to do great damage and is currently threatening as much.\par \par \uc2 We can't outright ignore him, because there are important post-mortems to be written, because he's a central character in the drama of where the G.O.P. goes from here, and because he has captured the imaginations and vented the frustrations of tens of millions of Americans.\par \par \uc2 But we also can't roll over for him, the way we've sometimes done over the last 16 months, chronicling even those speeches and rallies that amounted to sales pitches for his properties and products. His reckoning comes on Nov. 8. Ours comes shortly after that.\par \par \uc2 I invite you to follow me on Twitter (@FrankBruni) and join me on \uc2 Facebook\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Follow The \uc2 New York Times\uc2  Opinion section on \uc2 Facebook\uc2  and Twitter (@NYTopinion), and sign up for the Opinion Today newsletter.\par \par \uc2 DRAWING (DRAWING BY BEN WISEMAN) \par \par \uc2 Document NYTF000020161023ecan0005s\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

It's Me, Reality\b0\par\par\uc2 By GINIA BELLAFANTE \par \uc2 987 \uc2 words\par \uc2 23 October 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 1\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Growing up on Long Island in the 1970s, I kept a copy of Judy Blume's ''Are You There, God? It's Me, Margaret,'' in its classic lavender-tinted paperback edition, tucked away in a closet in my playroom with the vague intention of returning it to the local library, someday. As months went by and I read and reread the novel upward of a half-dozen times, it became clear that I would never give it up. I imagined thousands of dollars of fines accruing and ultimately an arrest followed by some period of detention. Wasn't the involvement of law enforcement the only proper response to an abject refusal to relinquish something so precious?\par \par \uc2 Like Margaret Simon, I was an only child suspicious of suburban idyll. I consumed the book, as I would go on, in my 20s, to consume anything by \uc2 Richard Yates\uc2  or John Cheever, seeking assurances that a lawn was a poor means of generating certain existential satisfactions. The novel begins with its heroine forced to leave Manhattan, with all of its enrichments, when her parents decide to move to the suburbs (for all of the reasons parents have always decided to move to the suburbs). ''Please help me God,'' Margaret implores. ''Don't let New Jersey be too horrible.''\par \par \uc2 For women who grew up in the 1970s and early '80s -- nurtured in the fictions of Ms. Blume, Paul Zindel and Norma Klein among others, writers for whom an urbane brand of social realism was the only reasonable m\u233\'00\'E9tier -- the arrival of the ''Twilight'' franchise a decade ago, with its enormous success, signaled a gloomy period of regression for the young-adult novel. The first of the ''Twilight'' books appeared in 2005, two years after \uc2 Arnold Schwarzenegger\uc2  became the governor of California amid sexual assault allegations that prompted relatively little of the outcry now bedeviling Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2 . A distinct product of Bush-era gender politics rather than a renunciation of them, the series ultimately has its heroine forfeit a chance to go to Dartmouth to stay home and tend to her half-vampire baby, one conceived after a night of violent sex that leaves her body bruised with a husband who is at least 100 years old.\par \par \uc2 Now, though, the appetite for paranormal lunacy has abated, and issue-driven fiction set very much in a universe of urbanism's chief concerns is having a renaissance. This week, ''All American Boys,'' a novel by Jason Reynolds and Brendan Kiely, an outgrowth of the \uc2 Black Lives Matter movement\uc2 , appears on The \uc2 New York Times\uc2 's best-seller list for young-adult books. The story follows the beating of an innocent black child by a white police officer who thinks he has stolen a bag of chips.\par \par \uc2 In a similar vein, ''The Hate U Give,'' to be released early next year, chronicles the story of a 16-year-old prep-school girl who witnesses a police officer shoot her unarmed best friend. A movie version of the novel, by Angela Thomas, is already in progress. And right now, prominently displayed at \uc2 Barnes & Noble\uc2  in Downtown Brooklyn, is ''Bright Lights, Dark Nights,'' a novel about racial profiling set against the backdrop of drugs and violence.\par \par \uc2 The recent upheavals in the economy stemming from the financial crisis, the rise of racial tensions and the increased animosity toward immigrants that the current \uc2 election\uc2  cycle has fed and exposed have arguably made this new catalog inevitable. The world has intruded in the lives of children in so many ugly ways. Even an amused tone does not preclude political currency. Consider the coming book ''June the Sparrow and the Million-Dollar Penny,'' which is meant for children between 9 and 12. In it, an orphaned girl who lives along Central Park discovers one day while she is sitting in Gray's Papaya that her fortune has been decimated in a Ponzi scheme. She is then forced to move from an apartment in the Dakota to an actual Dakota (South).\par \par \uc2 Some of these books take place in unnamed cities so that they can feel universal to their readers. ''The American Street,'' highly anticipated and arriving this winter, is a novel set in Detroit but is meant to evoke Bushwick, Brooklyn, during the 1980s when it was a desolate and untamed place. The author, Ibi Zoboi, is Haitian and grew up in Bushwick, and she wanted to tell the story of an immigrant girl coming-of-age in a place where she must navigate a community plagued by crime and addiction.\par \par \uc2 ''I remember my upbringing of people coming here for jobs and then not getting those jobs,'' Ms. Zoboi told me. ''The immigrant's story is not one of rags to riches automatically.'' Gentrification made it too implausible to set the story in the Bushwick of today. ''The house we grew up in was on the market recently for $2 million, and that really hurt,'' she said. ''We tried so hard to get out.''\par \par \uc2 In some sense these new realist novels are even grittier than their predecessors from the 1970s, even though children, especially in New York where crime rates were so high, faced greater perils then. The classic young-adult novel of that period typically dealt with characters managing the fracture of American family life -- divorce, a mother's new boyfriend and so on -- but those characters most often enjoyed the comforts of middle-class life. Norma Klein's Manhattan was as sophisticated as any Woody Allen would devise. Children today may finally be resisting the elusive insulation we crave for them.\par \par \uc2 Email: bigcity@nytimes.com\par \par \uc2 Brendan Kiely outside the Jefferson Market Library in Manhattan. He is a co-author of ''All American Boys,'' about the beating of an innocent black child by a white officer.

\par\par \uc2 Style Desk; SECTST\par \b \uc2 Can He Have Your Attn:, Please?\b0\par\par\uc2 By BENOIT DENIZET-LEWIS \par \uc2 1,617 \uc2 words\par \uc2 23 October 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 8\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 LOS ANGELES -- One Friday morning last month, Matthew Segal huddled around a table with producers and video editors from his millennial news and issues site, Attn:, whose street-level lobby here previously housed a thrift shop. As the baby-faced staff prepared to pitch video ideas, Ted Cruz finally endorsed \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 But Mr. Segal, who is 31 and looks like a cross between a young John F. Kennedy Jr. and \uc2 John Kerry\uc2 , seemed uninterested in the news. That's not to say he doesn't care about politics. Mr. Segal testified to Congress about voting rights as a 19-year-old and founded two voter-empowerment organizations before starting Attn: (pronounced ''attention'') in 2014.\par \par \uc2 But if those experiences taught him anything, it's that young people ''care less about candidates than they do about issues,'' he said.\par \par \uc2 In the weeks before the pitch meeting, Attn: had produced videos with titles like ''It's Time to Stop Treating Our Oceans Like Dumpsters,'' ''Sweden's Voter Turnout Puts America to Shame,'' ''We Should End Our War on Drugs Like Portugal Did'' and ''It's Time to Stop Ripping Off Plus-Size Women.''\par \par \uc2 But none succeeded like ''Dads and Moms Deserve More Time Off With Their Kids,'' which features a real-life couple (the ''Catfish'' host Nev Schulman and Laura Perlongo) striking silly domestic poses as they make the case for more parental leave.\par \par \uc2 ''It's going insanely viral,'' Mr. Segal said a few hours after the video went live. He was at dinner with his co-founder, Jarrett Moreno, who helped raise nearly $25 million in funding from big-name investors like Bill Maher and Ryan Seacrest.\par \par \uc2 By the time dinner ended, the video had spiked to 21 million views, from 15 million. ''Feel free to write down that this happens every day,'' Mr. Segal said jokingly.\par \par \uc2 At the Attn: staff meeting, Mr. Segal wore black jeans and a wrinkled dress shirt as he listened to a pitch lamenting that there are more police officers than counselors in some American school districts. When a young woman proposed a video about reducing the stigma against women who have an abortion, he questioned whether that stigma would preclude women from sharing the video on \uc2 Facebook\uc2 , where Attn: has more than three million fans.\par \par \uc2 ''There's the launch of Shout Your Abortion,'' she replied, ''where women are coming forward. ...''\par \par \uc2 ''Perfect!'' Mr. Segal said, interrupting in a way he often does when he gets excited about an idea. He combines intellectual curiosity with a short attention span, which means he rarely lets people finish their thoughts but often has a compelling reason for butting in.\par \par \uc2 To get people to share the abortion video, Mr. Segal urged the staff member to open with a focus on advocacy. ''That way people are applauding women speaking out,'' he said.\par \par \uc2 A few minutes later, an earnest 20-something pitched an idea about the disappearing bumblebee. ''Bees aren't kittens -- they don't engender a lot of sympathy,'' Mr. Segal interjected. ''Why should I care?''\par \par \uc2 ''Because bees pollinate a third of U.S. crops,'' the staff member said. ''Blueberries, cranberries, tomatoes.''\par \par \uc2 This led to a brief discussion about the cause of the bee carnage, which was apparently due in part to a pesticide (neonicotinoid) that no one in the room could pronounce. ''I would open with, 'You're literally going to run out of blueberries, cranberries and tomatoes,''' Mr. Segal concluded. ''Scare people. Then you can talk about ... bees.''\par \par \uc2 Mr. Segal certainly isn't alone in targeting progressive-leaning young people with shareable video content. Mic, NowThis and Upworthy are a few of Attn:'s more established competitors. But he seems particularly skilled at translating complicated issues into short, cogent content.\par \par \uc2 ''Matthew's smart enough to not try to fight an unwinnable war against the brief attention span of millennials,'' said Mr. Maher, who recently narrated an animated Attn: video about Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 . ''In 90-second videos, Attn:'s getting young people to care about things that actually matter. And, you know, sometimes you have to trick people into caring.''\par \par \uc2 ''If you want the dog to eat the pill,'' Mr. Maher added, ''you have to wrap it in a piece of bologna.''\par \par \uc2 Mr. Segal probably wouldn't put it that way, but he relishes the challenge of taking seemingly wonky issues and making them ''shareable'' (a word he uses practically every few seconds). He's especially proud of Attn:'s video about the less-than-thrilling topic of gerrymandering.\par \par \uc2 ''We were like, 'How the hell are we going to make gerrymandering interesting and shareable?''' he said. He and his team decided to make a ''Schoolhouse Rock''-like animated video that has been viewed nearly six million times.\par \par \uc2 ''If there's one thing that eventually goes on the Attn: tombstone,'' Mr. Segal said, ''it should probably be, 'Makers of the Most Viral Video Ever About Gerrymandering.'''\par \par \uc2 Though many of Attn:'s videos feature interviews with politicians and celebrities (like Elizabeth Warren and Snoop Dogg), Mr. Segal is careful not to give them too much screen time. In the video about our dirty oceans, which features an on-camera interview with Secretary of State \uc2 John Kerry\uc2 , Mr. Segal opens not with Mr. Kerry but with an image of a dead shark with blood in its mouth.\par \par \uc2 ''I wish it were as simple as people wanting to hear \uc2 John Kerry\uc2  talk about how messed up our oceans are, but you have to work a little harder if you want people to care,'' he said.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Segal learned that lesson at Our Time, a nonprofit he founded with Mr. Moreno in 2011 that worked to empower young voters. ''But we did too many years of the hard sell: Go register to vote, or else,'' Mr. Segal said. ''It became clear to us that if people don't understand the issues, or why their vote matters, telling them to vote is a moot point.\par \par \uc2 ''Politics are confusing,'' he continued. ''Fewer and fewer states are teaching anything about civics. But when you turn on cable news, there's very little discussion about issues, or why they matter.''\par \par \uc2 As a freshman at Kenyon College in Ohio, Mr. Segal didn't know much about issues either. Nor did he understand the difference ''between a state senator or a U.S. senator,'' he said. Still, he was excited to vote in his first presidential \uc2 election\uc2 . Mr. Segal cast his ballot early that morning in 2004, but he watched friends stand in line all day; some were still waiting to vote when the networks called the \uc2 election\uc2  for George W. Bush.\par \par \uc2 ''I'm like, 'Wow, every vote apparently doesn't matter,''' Mr. Segal said. ''And we were lucky, because we could skip class and our professors would cheer us on. But what about the single mother working two jobs? It really pissed me off.''\par \par \uc2 Mr. Segal spoke out publicly, and before he knew it, he was testifying before the House Judiciary Committee, which was investigating voting irregularities. ''It seems almost hypocritical that a society so focused on the importance of the vote did not concern itself more heavily with the actual process of voting,'' he told Congress.\par \par \uc2 Representative Jan Schakowsky, a Democrat from Illinois, met Mr. Segal soon after and remembers being impressed by his dedication and moxie. That was echoed by Mr. Seacrest, who said he invested in Attn: partly because he found Mr. Segal ''so engaging, intense and ferocious.''\par \par \uc2 Leading up to \uc2 Election\uc2  Day, Mr. Segal and Attn: have focused much of their attention on voter registration. They've started a ''3 Minutes'' video campaign, which features celebrities like Usher and Mary J. Blige talking about specific issues.\par \par \uc2 ''It took me three minutes to roll this blunt,'' Snoop Dogg says in a haze of smoke for his recent Attn: video. ''It only takes three minutes to register. If you want your marijuana legal, then register.''\par \par \uc2 Despite concerns that millennials won't vote in this \uc2 election\uc2 , Mr. Segal said he expects them to turn out. ''That's my hot take,'' he said. ''It's not just about voting against \uc2 Trump\uc2  or electing Hillary. People are getting fed up with police brutality, the war on drugs, the minimum wage, three-strikes laws, the transgender bathroom controversy.''\par \par \uc2 But even with the looming \uc2 election\uc2 , Mr. Segal is careful not to overwhelm his audience with politics. In recent months, Attn: has produced videos about how weddings are too expensive to attend, how public bathrooms in Japan put America to shame and how society discriminates against people with tattoos. Tattoo-phobia?\par \par \uc2 ''A lot of employers won't hire people with visible tattoos,'' he said. ''Maybe it's not as serious or seemingly existential as a video about how our oceans are going to kill us, but it's still a serious economic issue with generational implications.''\par \par \uc2 The more one talks to Mr. Segal, the more convincing he is as the ideal personality for an issue-driven media company aimed at young Americans. He clearly cares about a lot of things, but he also ''gets bored really easily,'' he confessed.\par \par \uc2 Might his short attention span be similar to Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's? Mr. Segal looked momentarily pained by the question. ''I hope never to be compared to \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  again,'' he said.\par \par \uc2 Continue following our fashion and lifestyle coverage on \uc2 Facebook\uc2  (Styles and Modern Love), \uc2 Twitter\uc2  (Styles, Fashion and Weddings) and \uc2 Instagram\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Matthew Segal is ''smart enough to not try to fight an unwinnable war against the brief attention span of millennials,'' said Bill Maher, an investor in the site.

\par\par \uc2 SOCIAL Q'S\par \uc2 Style Desk; SECTST\par \b \uc2 Workplace Politics\b0\par\par\uc2 By PHILIP GALANES \par \uc2 943 \uc2 words\par \uc2 23 October 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 10\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 I own a small bakery that's taking off. (We make a crazy good coconut cake!) I put a sign in the window, looking for help, and asked the manager to set up interviews with the best candidates. On the morning of the interviews, I saw a woman park her car. It had a \uc2 Trump\uc2  bumper sticker on it. By coincidence, she turned out to be the first person I interviewed. How terrible would it be for me not to hire her on that basis alone? If it makes a difference, I am an American citizen, born here, but my mom is Mexican. I have felt attacked by Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 AMELIA\par \par \uc2 We all knew this column was coming. (But relax, \uc2 Trump\uc2  supporters, Hillary fans get theirs in the next question.) And since when did cake become the most polarizing dessert? If it's not gay wedding cake boycotts, it's ''\uc2 Trump\uc2  icers need not apply.'' I think we can do better, pastry chefs.\par \par \uc2 As a legal matter, most job candidates, other than those in a few states and municipalities, enjoy no protection from discrimination by private employers based on their political affiliation or speech. So if your baseline for being ''terrible'' is lawbreaking, you can probably ding this applicant. But let's aim higher.\par \par \uc2 Put aside her supposed political preference (she may have borrowed the car from a friend) and answer this: Which applicant is best qualified and gives you the greatest confidence that she (or he) will work hard for the success of your bakery? That's the candidate you should hire. And frankly, all the better if it's the \uc2 Trump\uc2  supporter. We've become so Balkanized in our lives that it's often possible to chat only with people who agree with us all day long.\par \par \uc2 But many of us who are gay, for instance, became the recipients of surprising kindness, from unlikely quarters, when we started coming out in greater number. Folks discovered they already knew (and liked) gay people. They just didn't know they did. That's the beauty of cross-pollination. Perhaps when your new employee sees that children of immigrants are already our neighbors and co-workers and friends, she'll rethink the wisdom of ''Build That Wall!'' (And you can fire her if she doesn't work out.)\par \par \uc2 Human Resources Gone Rogue\par \par \uc2 I work at a midsize company in the h uman r esources department. This week, my boss (the head of the department) sent out a companywide email saying how important it is for us to vote for \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , especially if we care about reproductive freedom, as she does. I couldn't believe it! Is this as grossly inappropriate as it seems to my cubicle mate and me?\par \par \uc2 ANONYMOUS\par \par \uc2 If this weren't so egregious, it might actually be funny: Your human resources department needs a human resources department. The whole point of H.R. is to make everyone feel included in the \uc2 common cause\uc2  of your work. Broadcasting political positions during a hard-fought \uc2 election\uc2  is the antithesis of that. It would be wrong for any employee to do it. But it is even worse that she did. The head of human relations should know better. She tried to use her position of authority to influence those with less of it. (Happily, voting still happens in secret.)\par \par \uc2 Still, don't call your boss on her bad behavior and risk putting yourself in the doghouse (or losing your job) unless you are sure she can take constructive criticism -- and I mean, really sure. If so, say: ''Deirdre, I know you feel strongly about the \uc2 election\uc2 . But shouldn't we be more careful in H.R. to create an environment where everyone feels welcome, even if they don't support \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 ?''\par \par \uc2 If you aren't comfortable speaking with her, think about talking with her boss. But don't feel lily-livered if you don't -- or that this experience didn't have value. Watching our bosses make mistakes can be a great learning experience. I have no doubt that when you're in charge, you'll never make an error in judgment like this. (And we have your boss to thank for it, right?)\par \par \uc2 Muzzles for All\par \par \uc2 My wife and I adopted a puppy for our son. We go to the dog run in our neighborhood, and it's turned out to be nice family time for us. Our son throws a ball for the dog, and my wife and I hang out nearby. Yesterday, a woman approached our son and said: ''Please don't throw that ball. It will make my dog aggressive and start a fight.'' Granted, we're new at this, but it seemed like an inappropriate request. What do you think?\par \par \uc2 CARL, NEW YORK\par \par \uc2 If we learned anything from that ''Access Hollywood'' bus ride -- just to stick with our political theme (and keep it classy) -- it is this: Announcing our inappropriate tendencies in advance does not excuse them. Balls are allowed in dog runs. If tossing them makes this woman's dog aggressive, she should keep her dog on its leash or avoid the run. Teaching your son to stand up for himself, in a polite way, may take a bit of practice. But it is well worth the effort.\par \par \uc2 Continue following our fashion and lifestyle coverage on \uc2 Facebook\uc2  (Styles and Modern Love), \uc2 Twitter\uc2  (Styles, Fashion and Weddings) and \uc2 Instagram\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 For help with your awkward situation, send a question to SocialQ@nytimes.com or SocialQ on \uc2 Facebook\uc2 .

\par\par \uc2 NIGHT OUT\par \uc2 Style Desk; SECTST\par \b \uc2 Room for Debate: The \uc2 Trump\uc2  Tower Bar\b0\par\par\uc2 By KATIE ROGERS \par \uc2 1,008 \uc2 words\par \uc2 23 October 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 10\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 It was cocktail hour on a recent afternoon, and the comedian Chelsea Handler, her brother Glen, and a publicist sat at the bar in \uc2 Trump\uc2  Tower, the gilded home and workplace of Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , the building's namesake and the country's Republican presidential nominee.\par \par \uc2 This part of the building is billed as ''a stylish and welcoming respite from the bustling Midtown crowds.'' But the maroon drapery, dim lighting and fading carpets did not impress Ms. Handler. Nearby, a man with a ponytail sipped a beer, and a small gaggle of tourists wearing sequined tops poked their heads into the bar.\par \par \uc2 ''I feel like we're at an airport lounge,'' Ms. Handler, 41, said in a deadpan. ''Like a really bad airport lounge.''\par \par \uc2 This backdrop is not the most obvious of meeting places for a woman who has used her many platforms -- \uc2 Twitter\uc2 ; her \uc2 Netflix\uc2  talk show, ''Chelsea''; and, occasionally, her body -- to warn the public against Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's presidential ambitions, often in language that can't be printed here.\par \par \uc2 Ms. Handler was in town for only a few days last month, and she wanted to squeeze the trip to \uc2 Trump\uc2  Tower in between interviews for her show and rehearsals for the Global Citizen Festival.\par \par \uc2 ''I thought it might just be a nice change of pace,'' she said, ''to see if everybody here is as pumped up about their candidate as he thinks they are.''\par \par \uc2 Although the building has become the site for rowdy protests in recent weeks, the energy inside during Ms. Handler's visit could not be described exactly as ''pumped up.'' Around 5 p.m., shortly before Ms. Handler retired to the bar, the basement food court began to close down and people drifted through the halls, peeking around corners and hovering near the basement bathrooms.\par \par \uc2 Ms. Handler lingered at the gift shop in the basement, a labyrinth of gold-toned mirror panels and rust-colored marble. ''Anytime you use that color marble, you're covering up for something,'' she said.\par \par \uc2 She perused crystal cuff links (made in China) and candy bars. A shopper in an oversize T-shirt and glasses stood close by, unable to place Ms. Handler. In fact, few people seemed to recognize her.\par \par \uc2 ''You don't know who that is?'' a shopkeeper, Alicia, whispered to the T-shirt woman. ''That's Chelsea.''\par \par \uc2 Ms. Handler has been in show business for over a decade, with much of her time focused on a celebrity-driven talk show. With ''Chelsea,'' she has pivoted, in an effort to discuss politics at a time when people's attention spans are fractured, in part by this bruising \uc2 election\uc2  cycle and in part by social media.\par \par \uc2 She is about halfway through making 90 more episodes ordered up by \uc2 Netflix\uc2 . She has used the show not only to explain modern politics to her viewers, but also to explain United States \uc2 election\uc2  history.\par \par \uc2 ''I can talk about politics, science and health,'' Ms. Handler said at the bar. ''About things that actually matter and impact someone's information in a more palatable way.'' I think that's what I set out to do, and like this is what I've wanted to be doing for a while.''\par \par \uc2 But tonight is about relaxing and enjoying a Handler family pastime: cocktails. You may recognize Ms. Handler's brother from a recent profile of The \uc2 New York Times\uc2 's most prolific internet commenters. He writes under the handle Socrates and likes to talk about death, spirituality and politics online.\par \par \uc2 He seems to enjoy these topics in person, too.\par \par \uc2 ''He always makes sure that I don't believe in God,'' Ms. Handler said of her brother.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Handler said, ''We're all a bunch of ants marching on this planet, and we're all about to kill each other.''\par \par \uc2 (To the suggestion that maybe the wrong Handler sibling got the talk show, Ms. Handler responded she was certain her brother would agree.)\par \par \uc2 The bartender, also named Alicia, told Mr. Handler that Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  comes here often for interviews and does not drink.\par \par \uc2 ''Red flag,'' Mr. Handler said.\par \par \uc2 ''Major red flag,'' Ms. Handler said.\par \par \uc2 Anyone who has read her books or watched her TV shows will know that drinking is a major tenet of Ms. Handler's comedy. Is it just a comedic device?\par \par \uc2 ''There's no lore: I love drinking,'' Ms. Handler said. ''I'm always up for working longer or staying longer or having a longer dinner or having a longer meeting if there's a cocktail involved. It's like my Ritalin.''\par \par \uc2 While nursing a Tito's vodka with a splash of soda, Ms. Handler ordered a burger -- medium well, no cheese -- and then picked at the meat. A platter of chicken wings drew her attention. They tasted frozen, she said, but they were ultimately not that bad. After the \uc2 Netflix\uc2  publicist turned up with a dish of what appeared to be microwaved peanuts, the group decided to leave.\par \par \uc2 They headed for the Mark, a hotel on the Upper East Side where Ms. Handler likes to stay when she's in town. It is here that Ms. Handler's favorite summer cocktail, an Aperol spritz, was sampled and where Ms. Handler eventually stole away to her room for a few minutes to herself.\par \par \uc2 While away, she posted a video to her Snapchat account, in which she talked about a book, ''Love Warrior,'' that made her cry on the flight from Los Angeles to New York.\par \par \uc2 Another video followed: ''Every time I try to be alone I end up with a group of people,'' she said. ''With drinks.''\par \par \uc2 Continue following our fashion and lifestyle coverage on \uc2 Facebook\uc2  (Styles and Modern Love), \uc2 Twitter\uc2  (Styles, Fashion and Weddings) and \uc2 Instagram\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Left, Chelsea Handler on an escalator in \uc2 Trump\uc2  Tower.

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 CHICAGO -- \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2  had just called \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  a ''nasty woman,'' and Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's childhood girlfriends started laughing. ''I'm so glad he said that,'' one friend said. ''He just couldn't stop himself,'' another said.\par \par \uc2 The group was piled onto couches, a few of them seated on the floor, crowded around a television for the final presidential debate at the home of Hardye Moel, a psychotherapist who met Hillary Rodham as freshmen at \uc2 Maine East High School\uc2  in Park Ridge, a quiet upper-middle-class suburb of Chicago.\par \par \uc2 There was pizza, wine and popcorn; and Betsy Ebeling, Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's best friend since the sixth grade, was providing to-the-moment updates from a friend who was on the floor in Las Vegas -- ''seated behind Wayne Newton!'' she announced.\par \par \uc2 For a group watching their best friend appear on stage, just two weeks from \uc2 Election\uc2  Day, they were surprisingly calm.\par \par \uc2 What was it like, watching her up there? I wanted to know. Were they nervous? And it wasn't that they were unfazed. Perhaps it was just that they had been through this before.\par \par \uc2 ''For me, it's a nice distraction to have everybody here,'' said Ms. Moel, in a patterned shift dress adorned with blue ''Hillary 2016'' buttons. ''For some reason this time, as soon as she walked out tonight, I felt really confident. I just thought, 'Yes, girl. You can do this.'''\par \par \uc2 ''Girl'' is a term this group uses liberally. When Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  called Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  a puppet -- when pressed on Russia -- there were exclamations of ''You go, girl!'' from the living room.\par \par \uc2 These women have, in fact, known Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  since she was a girl. They came of age together: bicycling to movies, arguing about which Beatle was the cutest; attending church; going to see Martin Luther King Jr. speak for the first time.\par \par \uc2 They were present for Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's first devastating political defeat, and they remember it clearly: It was student council president, in their senior year, and a girl had never won.\par \par \uc2 ''I was her campaign manager, so I advised her,'' Ms. Ebeling has joked. ''Hopefully this one turns out better.''\par \par \uc2 As a group, the women have been to each of the \uc2 Bill \uc2 Clinton\uc2  inaugurations and the opening of the \uc2 Clinton\uc2  library; they were there for her Senate run, when she was sworn in as secretary of state and at plenty of dinners, events and weddings.\par \par \uc2 When Hillary was first lady, Ms. Ebeling would on occasion meet her at the White House, where Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  would put on a hat and sunglasses, and the two would sneak out for a walk and coffee, undisturbed. They were there during the dark times, too: Monica Lewinsky, the impeachment, the emails.\par \par \uc2 ''My friends are from grade school and high school, and they are incredibly honest with me,'' she told The \uc2 Chicago Tribune\uc2  in 1996. ''There is no evidence whatsoever that they are in awe of me, and sometimes I wish they were.''\par \par \uc2 The women -- a dozen or so in all -- plan to travel to New York City on \uc2 Election\uc2  Day to support their friend. They campaigned in Iowa in 2008 -- on a bus, during a snowstorm, at one point stuck on an icy incline. ''There was a moment when we thought we might not make it,'' Ms. Moel said. When Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  lost the nomination, she had a pendant engraved for Ms. Ebeling that read: ''18 million cracks in the ceiling.''\par \par \uc2 These days, the friends' interactions are more contained. Ms. Ebeling is the unofficial conduit, giving updates, letting Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  know if there has been a death in the family, reminding her of birthdays, sending her articles from their hometown paper. In July, at the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia, Ms. Ebeling. a delegate from Illinois, announced the vote totals for their home state, her voice breaking slightly when she read them.\par \par \uc2 ''On this historic, wonderful day, in honor of Dorothy and Hugh's daughter and my sweet friend -- I know you're watching -- this one's for you, Hill,'' Ms. Ebeling said. Her friends were in the audience, a couple of them in matching red, white and blue sneakers they'd bought at Target.\par \par \uc2 Before declaring her candidacy for president in 2007, Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  described herself as ''probably the most famous person you don't really know.'' It was striking coming from someone who has lived most of her life in the public eye, and yet that has long been one of the most common criticisms lodged against her: that she is aloof, unrelatable, cold.\par \par \uc2 Her friends say the opposite. ''It's a twisted version of Hillary that we see portrayed,'' Ms. Moel said. ''I've just been thinking a lot lately, what is it about powerful women that people don't like, that is problematic for a lot of people?''\par \par \uc2 ''They don't know enough to know what they don't like about her,'' said Ms. Ebeling.\par \par \uc2 The real Hillary, they say, is warm, nurturing, loyal and funny. She loves hot sauce and always keeps a bottle in her purse. Emails are a dirty word now, but among those released, you'll find Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  wishing Ms. Ebeling and her pals a ''Happy Halloween from Angkor Wat!'' and ''Love and scones'' from London, where she had spent a night at Buckingham Palace. She gushes about having to concentrate while on stage with Chelsea, during a \uc2 Clinton\uc2  Global Initiative plenary in 2011, to avoid ''acting like a total goofball Mother overcome by pride and struck dumb!''\par \par \uc2 She's also, her friends say, a great problem solver and an excellent listener. And she has stamina, too -- an amount unmatched by any of her friends.\par \par \uc2 ''Bonnie and I talk too much on the phone,'' said Ms. Moel, seated next to Bonnie Ward Klehr, a jewelry designer whose pieces can often be seen on Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 . ''And so often at the end of the day we're like, 'I'm so tired.' 'Oh, my God, I have to go to bed at 8:30!' And then we talk about Hillary and we always say, 'How does she do it?' Even if she wasn't a friend, just for a person our age, it's just amazing.''\par \par \uc2 ''You know,'' Ms. Ebeling said, ''if Hillary were here, we'd be laughing, we'd be joking about our ...'' she pinches the skin underneath her biceps. ''But she can't do that now.''\par \par \uc2 ''But tonight,'' she said on Wednesday, ''our friend did beautifully.''\par \par \uc2 Continue following our fashion and lifestyle coverage on \uc2 Facebook\uc2  (Styles and Modern Love), \uc2 Twitter\uc2  (Styles, Fashion and Weddings) and \uc2 Instagram\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Top, watching the debate, from left: Judy Osgood, Patsy Bowles, Bonnie Ward Klehr, Jill Harker, Katie Ricketts, Betsy Ebeling and Hardye Moel.

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Just before the final debate between \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  and \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2  kicks off in Las Vegas on Wednesday night with immigration as a focus, a group will gather in New York to celebrate ''Nuevo New York,'' a book about creative professionals of Latin American descent. Included in it are well-known figures like Carolina Herrera, Maria Cornejo, Carlos Campos, Francisco Costa and Nina Garcia.\par \par \uc2 The book, released last month, is a passion project of Gabriel Rivera-Barraza, a publicist from Durango, Mexico, who immigrated to the United States at 13, and Hans Neumann, a photographer from Lima, Peru, who arrived here when he was about 23. Mr. Rivera-Barraza and Mr. Neumann spent four years interviewing and photographing nearly 80 subjects.\par \par \uc2 ''It's a celebration of Latin Americans,'' Mr. Neumann said. ''It's about happiness and laughter and freedom. A different point of view.''\par \par \uc2 Mr. Rivera-Barraza and Mr. Neumann insist it's a coincidence that on the night of the final debate they are celebrating Latinos, a group that has found itself targeted during this \uc2 election\uc2  cycle. But they emphasized the importance of doing so anyway.\par \par \uc2 ''We're the biggest minority in the U.S.,'' Mr. Rivera-Barraza said. ''It's time for us to talk about the nice side of our culture.''\par \par \uc2 Narciso Rodriguez, a Cuban-American designer who appears in the book, is also the focus of an exhibition that opened last weekend at the Patricia & Phillip Frost Art Museum at \uc2 Florida International University\uc2  in Miami.\par \par \uc2 ''It is very important to incorporate the accomplishments of Latin American artists, architects, and designers into the canon of history,'' \uc2 Jordana Pomeroy\uc2 , the director of the museum, wrote in an email.\par \par \uc2 When the political conversation turned last year to suggestions of building a wall, deporting immigrants and barring Muslims from entry, Mr. Rivera-Barraza and Mr. Neumann thought it was even more important to finish the book despite running low on funds. But they were concerned some of their subjects might back out from fear of being in the spotlight. Instead, they were surprised by how many additional people wanted to participate; they ended up extending their deadline and adding more than two dozen portraits.\par \par \uc2 Both men have noticed a change in tone in the conversation about immigrants during the last year.\par \par \uc2 ''My nephew came to me the other day and said: 'Uncle, it's bad to be Mexican. At school they're saying this or that,''' Mr. Rivera-Barraza said. ''That really hurt. That really scared me. I don't want my niece and nephew to be ashamed because someone is saying they're less than.''\par \par \uc2 For him, the need to provide role models in the creative industry for a younger generation of Latin American descent became a particularly important goal.\par \par \uc2 ''A lot of these kids don't know where to look,'' Mr. Rivera-Barraza said. ''They're the first generation who are going to get educated. We want to tell them, 'Don't give up.'''\par \par \uc2 Dr. Pomeroy of the Frost Museum noted that showing young people what they can aspire to is part of the work of an exhibition like the one about Mr. Rodriguez. ''It is imperative that children of Latin American descent living in the U.S. are exposed to a spectrum of futures through places like museums,'' she said.\par \par \uc2 And what of the book's subjects? Ms. Cornejo, a fashion designer whose story of leaving Chile when she was 11 as a political refugee, then moving to London, then Paris and finally New York appears in ''Nuevo New York,'' said she loved the sense of community participating in the book gave her.\par \par \uc2 ''It's amazing the amount of Latinos who are in the business of fashion and the arts,'' she said. Joining their ranks gave her a sense of place after being unmoored for many years.\par \par \uc2 ''I was a bit countryless,'' she said. ''New York is where I found my own way. This is the one place I've lived the longest. My family has grown here, my children grew up here, I built my business here.''\par \par \uc2 Reflecting on the \uc2 election\uc2 , Mr. Neumann expressed disappointment that he will not be able to vote because he is a resident, not a citizen, but was also hopeful that those who can will make their voice count.\par \par \uc2 ''In the end, America is full of immigrants, and it has been for centuries,'' he said. ''You can't deny that about a country full of Irish people, Russian people, English people, Latin people. Who's not an immigrant, really?''\par \par \uc2 Continue following our fashion and lifestyle coverage on \uc2 Facebook\uc2  (Styles and Modern Love), \uc2 Twitter\uc2  (Styles, Fashion and Weddings) and \uc2 Instagram\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 The fashion designer Carlos Campos, as seen in ''Nuevo New York.''

\par\par \uc2 National Desk; SECTA\par \b \uc2 How Citing Voter Fraud Became a Political Tactic\b0\par\par\uc2 By MICHAEL WINES \par \uc2 2,099 \uc2 words\par \uc2 22 October 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 13\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 CORRECTION APPENDEDIn asserting that the presidential \uc2 election\uc2  has been rigged against him and casting accusations of widespread voter fraud, Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2  has tapped deep into an increasingly prevalent theme of Republican Party politics: that Democrats try to steal elections, not win them.\par \par \uc2 It is the culmination of roughly two decades of alarms, investigations and political gamesmanship in which remarkably little voter fraud has been documented, but the conviction that it is widespread has gone from a fringe notion to an article of faith for many Republicans.\par \par \uc2 The Republican focus on voter fraud dates to the late 1990s, when the 1993 National Voter Registration Act -- the ''motor-voter'' law -- was put in place. Republicans in particular, but some \uc2 election\uc2  administrators as well, began to complain that registering had become too easy and ill supervised to spot ineligible voters.\par \par \uc2 The stakes for both parties in \uc2 election\uc2  rules and who gets to vote became glaringly clear in 2000, when a 537-vote court-challenged victory in Florida's presidential \uc2 election\uc2  sent George W. Bush to the White House.\par \par \uc2 In the same \uc2 election\uc2 , accusations of voter fraud became a volatile issue in Missouri. Republicans claimed that Democrats in St. Louis were trying to steal that state's Senate \uc2 election\uc2  after lawyers for Al Gore's campaign won a court order keeping the city's polls open late to accommodate voters who had been wrongly removed from the rolls.\par \par \uc2 And issues of race, often a subtext in Republican charges of fraud, were accentuated by the \uc2 election\uc2  of the nation's first black president in 2008. Republican accusations of voter fraud, as in St. Louis, have frequently been directed at minority groups in cities such as Philadelphia and Chicago. The issue now thrives in the hothouse of the internet, where corrections of fact and debunkings rarely catch up with the claims they address.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's pronouncement ''did not come out of thin air,'' Richard L. Hasen, an \uc2 election\uc2  law expert and professor at the University of California, Irvine, said in an interview. ''It is, in fact, an often-repeated theme by those on the right who have been claiming, especially since 2000, that Democrats are stealing elections with voter fraud.''\par \par \uc2 The notion of widespread fraud has also become a potent political weapon: Since 2010, 16 states have placed new identification requirements on voting in the name of security. Increasingly, they have required voters to produce proof of identification that young, poor and minority voters -- often Democrats -- disproportionately lack.\par \par \uc2 None of that is to say that American elections are flawless. On the contrary, the national \uc2 election\uc2  system is a hodgepodge of outdated voting machines, underfinanced \uc2 election\uc2  offices and voter registration lists riddled with errors and insufficiently groomed to remove the dead and people who have moved away. And experts say a new and growing worry is the possibility of the hacking of \uc2 election\uc2  rolls, including by foreign interests.\par \par \uc2 A 2014 report in the journal Electoral Studies -- roundly criticized by other researchers as methodologically flawed -- suggested that registration procedures are lax enough that as many as one in 15 non-United States citizens living in the country could have mistakenly cast ballots in the 2008 \uc2 election\uc2 . A 2012 study by the Pew Center on the States, cited by Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  on the campaign trail, concluded that 24 million registrations were outdated or invalid, 1.8 million registrants were dead and 2.75 million were registered in more than one state.\par \par \uc2 But even the study that Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  cited pointed to inefficient administration, not fraud. In a series of tweets, David Becker, the primary author of the study, said the study found no evidence of noncitizen voter registration or voting, and no evidence of voter fraud because of out-of-date records or deceased people still on voting rolls. He said voter rolls are more accurate now than when the study was done in 2012.\par \par \uc2 And, perhaps most important, the principal fraud that Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  and most Republicans assail, and the only one that voter identification laws address -- voters who intentionally misrepresent themselves at polling places -- is exceedingly rare, experts say. They add that it is almost impossible to perpetrate on a scale that would affect the results of a national \uc2 election\uc2 . Democrats also note that with Republican domination of state governments, voting nationwide is increasingly overseen by Republicans.\par \par \uc2 No national database of voter fraud cases exists. But a study by \uc2 Justin Levitt\uc2 , a professor at Loyola Law School in Los Angeles who currently works in the Civil Rights Division of the Justice Department, uncovered only 31 credible claims of voter impersonation between 2000 and 2014, out of one billion ballots that were cast. An \uc2 Arizona State University\uc2  journalism project reviewed 2,068 allegations of \uc2 election\uc2  fraud between 2000 and 2012 and concluded that only 10 had involved misrepresentation.\par \par \uc2 Corrupt Officials\par \par \uc2 More common and largely unaddressed, but still rare, are fraudulent mail-in ballots and corruption among \uc2 election\uc2  officials.\par \par \uc2 Fraud charges are a staple of American politics, and once were frequently true. Terre Haute, Ind., was infamous for a 1914 scandal in which the mayor rigged voting machines, bought off voters, registered thousands of nonexistent voters and arrested nosy poll watchers.\par \par \uc2 But if thievery has not vanished since then, its scope has shrunk markedly: Four Troy, N.Y., officials and party workers were convicted in 2011 of creating false absentee ballots that may have swung local elections. And the next year, Indiana's chief elections official, Secretary of State Charlie White, was convicted of six felonies involving voter fraud, including submitting a false ballot.\par \par \uc2 The possibility that fraud or incompetence could change the outcome of a close presidential contest, as some claim happened when John F. Kennedy took the White House on the strength of an 8,000-vote margin in Illinois, is at least conceivable, experts say. But even other Republicans have scoffed at Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's claims that this year's \uc2 election\uc2  could be rigged by voter fraud. Gov. John Kasich of Ohio, a Republican primary opponent, likened them on Wednesday to ''saying we never landed on the moon, frankly. That's how silly it is.''\par \par \uc2 Yet the charges by Republicans that fraud is pervasive have grown in the last 15 years, driven both by the party's rightward shift and by national events.\par \par \uc2 Since the 2000 presidential \uc2 election\uc2  underscored the crucial role of voting rules in close races, allegations of widespread fraud have also figured in high-stakes political strategies. Increasingly, voter identification laws and other restrictions advertised as \uc2 election\uc2  security measures help determine who votes, and who does not.\par \par \uc2 ''Suddenly, it became clear that in very close elections, manipulating the rules could potentially matter,'' said Mr. Hasen, the \uc2 election\uc2  law expert. ''And so voter fraud became an excuse for making it harder to register and to vote.''\par \par \uc2 And as the notion of pervasive fraud gained political value, keeping it in the public eye became smart politics as well.\par \par \uc2 During the administration of George W. Bush, Attorney General \uc2 Alberto R. Gonzales\uc2 , a Republican, directed United States attorneys to aggressively pursue voter-fraud cases after Mr. Bush and his political adviser, Karl Rove, called for a focus on the issue. By 2007, five years after the fraud crackdown began, the attorneys had brought just 120 cases nationwide -- many involving mistakes or petty violations like completing more than one registration form -- and won 86 convictions out of about 200 million votes cast.\par \par \uc2 President Obama's general-\uc2 election\uc2  opponent in 2008, Senator \uc2 John McCain\uc2 , savaged him over allegations of voter-registration fraud by a left-leaning neighborhood organizing group, the Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now, or Acorn, that had run registration drives in 21 states. Mr. McCain said Acorn was ''on the verge of maybe perpetrating one of the greatest frauds in voter history in this country, maybe destroying the fabric of democracy.''\par \par \uc2 Republicans accused Acorn's voter-registration workers of falsely enrolling voters on a vast scale, sometimes with names like Mickey Mouse. Some workers did submit false registrations, but the group said it regularly worked to detect such fraud and fired those involved. A 2009 inquiry by the \uc2 Congressional Research Service\uc2  found no evidence that anyone registered by the group had cast a fraudulent ballot.\par \par \uc2 Investigations suggested that the group's greatest crime may have been sloppiness, not intended fraud. But the charges added to a snowballing public conviction that fraud is rife. Nearly half of Americans believe voter fraud happens at least somewhat often, and 70 percent think it happens at least occasionally, according to an ABC News/Washington Post poll released last month.\par \par \uc2 Then and now, Republican leaders have said repeatedly that the requirements are sorely needed to rein in ballot-box misrepresentation, largely by Democrats. ''Leaders of the other party are against efforts to crack down on voter fraud,'' Gov. Greg Abbott of Texas, a Republican, said in March. ''The fact is that voter fraud is rampant.''\par \par \uc2 Few Confirmed Cases\par \par \uc2 Among many Republicans, fraud's ubiquity remains evident. ''There are instances all over southeast Missouri,'' said former Senator \uc2 Kit Bond\uc2 , one of those who raised accusations of fraud in the St. Louis voting in 2000 and is now a St. Louis lawyer. ''A lot of people tell tales of buses being loaded up and visiting numerous polling places. And there's some instances this year. It's a small percentage that we discover.''\par \par \uc2 But few of the claims have been confirmed.\par \par \uc2 After investigations of the fraud allegations in St. Louis, only six of the 2,361,586 Missouri votes cast in the 2000 \uc2 election\uc2  were conclusively found to have been ineligible, either deliberately or inadvertently.\par \par \uc2 The Kansas secretary of state, Kris Kobach -- a Republican, self-proclaimed \uc2 Trump\uc2  adviser and ardent advocate of a voter-fraud crackdown -- asserted in an interview this year that he had uncovered a score of foreigners in just one Kansas county who had illegally registered to vote or had been stopped from registering. A list of the 17 noncitizens cited in a federal lawsuit showed that only one had ever cast a ballot; five had notified authorities of erroneous registrations on their own or through relatives.\par \par \uc2 In Lee County, Fla., a 2012 television news report that claimed to find over 100 foreigners illegally registered to vote prompted a criminal inquiry and cries for reform. But while officials did uncover some wrongly enrolled foreigners, few had actually voted, and error or confusion, not fraud, was the culprit, the county supervisor of elections, Sharon L. Harrington, said.\par \par \uc2 ''There has never been any prosecution in Lee County of anyone who registered and/ or voted illegally, even though information has been submitted to our state's attorney's office,'' she said in an email. ''This is not a widespread issue.''\par \par \uc2 A conservative advocacy group made headlines in 2014 when, days before the November \uc2 election\uc2 , it filed a lawsuit alleging that thousands of Frederick County, Md., voters were actually illegally registered foreigners. But the suit was withdrawn two weeks later after the headlines faded. Maryland's chief investigator of \uc2 election\uc2  corruption, James Cabezas, said the allegations were unsubstantiated. ''Whoever's saying all these people falsely voted, that they're illegals, that's just not true,'' he said.\par \par \uc2 Indeed, most voting experts say threats of disenfranchising voters are far more worrisome than widespread fraud.\par \par \uc2 ''The frame is being controlled here by those who are promoting the idea that fraud is the problem,'' said Lorraine Minnite, a Rutgers University professor of political science and author of the book ''The Myth of Voter Fraud.''\par \par \uc2 ''If we shifted the framework to people who are trying to vote but don't get their votes counted,'' she said, ''we'd be having a different discussion.''\par \par \uc2 Correction: November 1, 2016, Tuesday\par \par \uc2 This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: Because of an editing error, an article on Oct. 22 about voting fraud misstated the source for conclusions that found no evidence of noncitizen voter registration or voting in the 2008 elections, and no evidence of fraud because of out-of-date records or deceased people still on voting rolls. The conclusions were from David Becker, the primary author of a 2012 Pew Center study, not the study itself.\par \par \uc2 Above, voting booths during early voting last week at Arizona State University in Tempe; left, a St. Louis police officer guarding the entrance to the city Board of \uc2 Election\uc2  Commissioners office as voters waited outside in November 2000.

\par\par \b \uc2 Declarations: Imagine a Sane \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\b0\par\par\uc2 By Peggy Noonan   \par \uc2 1,323 \uc2 words\par \uc2 22 October 2016\par \uc2 The Wall Street Journal\par \uc2 J\par A11\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 Look, he's a nut and you know he's a nut. I go to battleground states and talk to anyone, everyone. They all know \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2 's a nut. Some will vote for him anyway. Many are in madman-versus-criminal mode, living with (or making) their final decision. They got the blues. Everyone does. They're worried about the whole edifice: If this is where we are, where are we going?\par \par \uc2 I get the Reagan fantasy -- big guy with a nonstandard resume comes in from the outside, cleans out the stables, saves the day. But it's a fantasy and does not apply to this moment. I get the Jacksonian fantasy -- crude, rude populist comes in from the hinterlands and upends a decadent establishment to the huzzahs of normal people with mud on their boots. But it's a fantasy, and doesn't apply.\par \par \uc2 Because he's not a grizzled general who bears on his face the scars of a British sword, and not a shining citizen-patriot. He's a screwball. Do you need examples? You do not, because you're already thinking of them. For a year you've been observing the TV funhouse that is his brain.\par \par \uc2 I offer an observation from \uc2 Newt Gingrich\uc2 , \uc2 Trump\uc2  friend and supporter, on David Drucker's Washington Examiner podcast. Mr. Gingrich lauded Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  because he "thinks big" and is a transformational character. But he spoke too of \uc2 Trump\uc2 's essential nature. The GOP nominee "reacts very intensely, almost uncontrollably" to "anything which attacks his own sense of integrity or his own sense of respectability." "There's . . . a part of his personality that sometimes gets involved in petty things that make no sense." He found it "frankly pathetic" that Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  got mad because Paul Ryan didn't call to congratulate him after the second debate.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Gingrich said he hopes this will change. But people don't change the fundamentals of their nature at age 70.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's great historical role was to reveal to the Republican Party what half of its own base really thinks about the big issues. The party's leaders didn't know! They were shocked, so much that they indulged in sheer denial and made believe it wasn't happening.\par \par \uc2 The party's leaders accept more or less open borders and like big trade deals. Half the base does not! It is longtime GOP doctrine to cut entitlement spending. Half the base doesn't want to, not right now! Republican leaders have what might be called assertive foreign-policy impulses. When Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  insulted George W. Bush and nation-building and said he'd opposed the Iraq invasion, the crowds, taking him at his word, cheered. He was, as they say, declaring that he didn't want to invade the world and invite the world. Not only did half the base cheer him, at least half the remaining half joined in when the primaries ended.\par \par \uc2 The Republican Party will now begin the long process of redefining itself or continue its long national collapse. This is an epochal event. It happened because \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  intuited where things were and are going.\par \par \uc2 Since I am more in accord with Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's stands than not, I am particularly sorry that as an individual human being he's a nut.\par \par \uc2 Which gives rise to a question, for me a poignant one.\par \par \uc2 What if there had been a Sane \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2 ?\par \par \uc2 Oh my God, Sane \uc2 Trump\uc2  would have won in a landslide.\par \par \uc2 Sane \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2 , just to start, would look normal and happy, not grim and glowering. He would be able to hear and act on good advice. He would explain his positions with clarity and depth, not with the impatient half-grasping of a notion that marks real \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2 's public persona.\par \par \uc2 Sane \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  would have looked at a dubious, anxious and therefore standoffish Republican establishment and not insulted them, diminished them, done tweetstorms against them. Instead he would have said, "Come into my tent. It's a new one, I admit, but it's yuge and has gold faucets and there's a place just for you. What do you need? That I be less excitable and dramatic? Done. That I not act, toward women, like a pig? Done, and I accept your critique. That I explain the moral and practical underpinnings of my stand on refugees from terror nations? I'd be happy to. My well-hidden secret is that I love everyone and hear the common rhythm of their beating hearts."\par \par \uc2 Sane \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  would have given an anxious country more ease, not more anxiety. He would have demonstrated that he can govern himself. He would have suggested through his actions, while still being entertaining, funny and outsize, that yes, he understands the stakes and yes, since America is always claiming to be the leader of the world -- We are No.1! -- a certain attendant gravity is required of one who'd be its leader.\par \par \uc2 Sane \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  would have explained his immigration proposals with a kind of loving logic -- we must secure our borders for a host of serious reasons, and here they are. But we are grateful for our legal immigrants, and by the way, if you want to hear real love for America then go talk to them, for they experience more freshly than we what a wonderful place this is. In time, after we've fully secured our borders and the air of emergency is gone, we will turn to regularizing the situation of everyone here, because Americans are not only kindly, they're practical, and want everyone paying taxes.\par \par \uc2 Sane \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  would have spoken at great and compelling length of how the huge, complicated trade agreements created the past quarter-century can be improved upon with an eye to helping the American worker. Ideology, he might say, is the pleasant diversion of the unworried, but a nation that no longer knows how to make steel cannot be a great nation. And we are a great nation.\par \par \uc2 Sane \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  would have argued that controlling entitlement spending is a necessary thing but not, in fact, this moment's priority. People have been battered since the crash, in many ways, and nothing feels stable now. Beyond that no one right now trusts Washington to be fair and wise in these matters. Confidence-building measures are necessary. Let's take on the smaller task of turning around Veterans Affairs and see if we can't make that work.\par \par \uc2 Sane \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  would have known of America's hidden fractures, and would have insisted that a healthy moderate-populist movement cannot begin as or devolve into a nationalist, identity-politics movement. Those who look down on other groups, races or religions can start their own party. He, the famous brander, would even offer them a name: the Idiot Party.\par \par \uc2 Sane \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  would not treat the political process of the world's greatest democracy as if it were, as somebody said, the next-to-last episode of a reality-TV series. That's the episode that leaves you wondering how the season will end -- who will scream, who will leave the drunken party in a huff, who will accuse whom of being a whore. I guess that's what "I'll keep you in suspense" as to whether he'll accept the \uc2 election\uc2  result was about. We're being teed up. The explosive season finale is Nov.8. Maybe he'll leave in a huff. Maybe he'll call everyone whores.\par \par \uc2 Does he know he's playing with fire? No. Because he's a nut.\par \par \uc2 Sane \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  for president. Too bad he doesn't exist.\par \par \uc2 (See related letters: "Letters to the Editor: Imagine a Sane GOP United Behind \uc2 Trump\uc2 " -- WSJ Nov. 1, 2016)\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=wjco20161022000082"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document J000000020161022ecam00023\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 OP-ED COLUMNIST\par \uc2 Editorial Desk; SECTA\par \b \uc2 America, the Beautiful Untainted\b0\par\par\uc2 By ROGER COHEN \par \uc2 883 \uc2 words\par \uc2 22 October 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 23\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Delmore Schwartz, the poet, wrote of ''the beautiful American word, Sure.''\par \par \uc2 To anyone raised as I was in the crimped confines of a wearier continent, Europe, that little word is indeed a thing of beauty, expressing a sense of possibility, an embrace of tomorrow, openness to the stranger, and a readiness for adventure that no other country possesses in such degree. It is the most concise expression of the optimism inherent in the American idea.\par \par \uc2 It is also something incommunicable until lived. To the outsider, America may appear by turns vulgar or violent, crass or childish, ugly or superficial, and of course it can be all of these things. Jonathan Galassi, the poet and publisher, has written of the ''American cavalcade,'' Philip Roth of ''the indigenous American berserk,'' and there is a gaudy, raucous, cinematic tumult to American life that is without parallel. Relentless reinvention is what America does; that is not always pretty. But beneath it all reside a can-do straightforwardness and directness that are the warp and weft of the American tapestry.\par \par \uc2 ''Will you come with me?''\par \par \uc2 ''Sure.''\par \par \uc2 No questions asked. Sure I will. The word is at once strong and soft, reassuring above all. The American experiment unravels without this.\par \par \uc2 The spirit of ''Sure'' stands in contrast to the culture of impossibility and the fear of failure that often undercut European enterprise. Bitter experience of repetitive cataclysm has taught Europe to be wary of risk. Perhaps the French brick wall contained in the phrase ''pas possible,'' a frequent response to my inquiries during the years I lived in Paris, best expresses this mind-set. Call it the spirit of ''Non.'' No wonder Europe does social protection better than innovation.\par \par \uc2 Now if this America, whose essence is openness, whose first question is not ''Where do you come from?'' but ''What can you do for me?'' becomes consumed by rage, then it is lost. Rage is a closing of the mind. Anger against the foreigner, against the outsider and against the other may offer some passing consolation in times of difficulty or dread but they lead America away from itself. They offer the spirit of suspicion in place of the spirit of ''Sure.'' They undercut American decency. They replace the draw of the next frontier and of the unknown with the dead end of walls. Rage is also a form of dishonesty because it precludes the reflection that leads to truth.\par \par \uc2 And this in the end is all that \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2 , the Republican nominee for the highest office in the land, has had to offer America: his shallow, manipulative, self-important, scapegoat-seeking form of rage.\par \par \uc2 Over the three debates with \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  it became clear that this businessman who says he wants to make America great again in fact wants to make America shrink into a defensive crouch of resentment. \uc2 Trump\uc2  was small in the debates. He was as small as the America he seems to envisage. He was mean, nasty, petty and lazy. Smallness oozed from his petulant pout; it was all that would fit between those pursed lips. Any target was good for this showman whose ego is so consuming that he is utterly without conviction: Mexicans, Muslims, women, the disabled, war heroes, and, in the end, American democracy itself, for which he showed contempt in suggesting he might contest the outcome of an \uc2 election\uc2  that he contends, without the slightest shred of evidence, might be ''rigged.''\par \par \uc2 The America of ''Sure'' is a stranger to \uc2 Trump\uc2 . His is the angry America of ''shove it.'' If that frustrated, tribal and incensed America were not lurking in a time of disorienting economic upheaval, \uc2 Trump\uc2  would not have garnered millions of votes. He has held up a mirror to a troubled and divided society. That, I suppose, is some form of service. But the deeper, decent, direct, can-do America is stronger; and for that America the \uc2 Trump\uc2  now visible in all his aspects is simply unfit for high office. He would threaten to undo what America is.\par \par \uc2 Of all the sentences written about \uc2 Trump\uc2  over many, many months now, my favorite is the last one in the letter sent this month by The New York Times lawyer David McCraw to \uc2 Trump\uc2 's lawyer. \uc2 Trump\uc2  had demanded the retraction of an article about two women who had come forward to describe the way he had groped them. The women's accounts, McCraw argued, constituted newsworthy information of public concern, and he concluded: ''If Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  disagrees, if he believes that American citizens had no right to hear what these women had to say and that the law of this country forces us and those who would dare to criticize him to stand silent or be punished, we welcome the opportunity to have a court set him straight.''\par \par \uc2 Sure, we'll see you in court.\par \par \uc2 Sure, America is a country that, despite its ''original sin'' of racism, elected a black man.\par \par \uc2 Sure, America will elect a woman as president.\par \par \uc2 Sure, this land was made for you and me.\par \par \uc2 You can follow me on Twitter (@NYTimesCohen) or join me on \uc2 Facebook\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Follow The \uc2 New York Times\uc2  Opinion section on \uc2 Facebook\uc2  and Twitter (@NYTopinion), and sign up for the Opinion Today newsletter.\par \par \uc2 Document NYTF000020161024ecam0000e\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw272\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4080\pichgoal600

\par\par \b \uc2 Election\uc2  2016: \uc2 Trump\uc2  and \uc2 Clinton\uc2  Battle Over Iowa --- The Democrat's team pitches suburbanites to try to keep the state from turning red\b0\par\par\uc2 By Reid J. Epstein   \par \uc2 622 \uc2 words\par \uc2 22 October 2016\par \uc2 The Wall Street Journal\par \uc2 J\par A4\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 ANKENY, Iowa -- Iowa is the spot where \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  stands his best chance of turning a blue state red, but \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's campaign team is aiming to quell that possibility by turning loyal Republicans into Democratic voters.\par \par \uc2 At households where voters have long participated in GOP primaries and caucuses, \uc2 Clinton\uc2  volunteers are knocking on doors asking for the women in the house. The Democratic nominee's aides also are sending mail to Republican women and advertising to them online with reminders to vote.\par \par \uc2 Liz Cox, a West Des Moines school-board member who was elected as a delegate to the Polk County GOP convention this spring, said volunteers from Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's campaign called her repeatedly to ask for her support. Though she backed \uc2 Mitt Romney\uc2  in 2012, Ms. Cox said she will vote for Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  on Nov. 8.\par \par \uc2 "Four years ago, we got robocalls from Romney and mailers from Romney, we got a Christmas card from Romney," said Ms. Cox, who said she hasn't heard from Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's campaign. "I'm getting more of the personal touch from Hillary's people."\par \par \uc2 The Republican nominee still is favored in the state. White people without a college degree make up about 62% of the electorate. That demographic represents Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's most durable base of support, and its strength here is why the New York businessman has led every public poll of Iowa since August.\par \par \uc2 Gov. Terry Branstad, the GOP nominee's strongest and most enthusiastic local surrogate, dismissed the notion that Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  would lose votes from women in the suburbs.\par \par \uc2 "A lot of these suburban women will in the end say it's too big a risk to go with Hillary as opposed to what the \uc2 Trump\uc2  and Pence team offers," the governor said in a brief interview.\par \par \uc2 Yet Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  has repelled the college-educated Republicans who populate suburban communities here, according to the latest polling.\par \par \uc2 Though the \uc2 Clinton\uc2  campaign has a robust team in Iowa, it appears to be placing less emphasis on the state than some other places. Still, there are signs her ground team is succeeding in peeling away rank-and-file Republicans in suburban neighborhoods.\par \par \uc2 Claire Celsi, a Democrat running for the Iowa state house from West Des Moines, recalled approaching a Republican house and finding the man who lived there working in his garage.\par \par \uc2 The man told her he and his wife weren't interested in speaking to a Democrat. When Ms. Celsi returned to her car, she called the house and spoke to the man's wife -- who said she is voting for her and Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  this year.\par \par \uc2 "There's a lot of men who answer the door and speak for their wives," Ms. Celsi said.\par \par \uc2 Republican Sens. Joni Ernst and \uc2 Chuck Grassley\uc2  have campaigned with Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 . Gov. Branstad barnstormed the state this past week touting state and local candidates, along with Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 During a Tuesday appearance at a gun shop that serves as county GOP headquarters in Boone, Mr. Branstad told about 40 people that Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  has attracted "people who have not necessarily been Republicans, a lot of blue-collar, even union people."\par \par \uc2 Some elected Republicans who are hesitant to back Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  say there is institutional pressure to support him. Four-term state Sen. David Johnson of Ocheyedan said he was stripped of his committee assignment after he denounced Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  and switched his party affiliation to independent.\par \par \uc2 "They've got a price on my head," Mr. Johnson said.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=wjco20161022000120"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document J000000020161022ecam00035\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 At least three American states have turned down Russian requests to monitor polling locations during the \uc2 election\uc2  on Nov. 8, as United States officials portrayed the overture as little more than a Russian public relations stunt.\par \par \uc2 Russia's consul general in Houston, Alexander K. Zakharov, wrote letters dated in September to officials in Texas, Louisiana and Oklahoma requesting that a Russian officer be present ''for a short period of time, when convenient,'' with the ''goal of studying the U.S. experience in organization of voting process.''\par \par \uc2 But United States officials have been wary of Russia meddling in the \uc2 election\uc2 , and the American government formally accused Russia of being responsible for recent hacks surrounding American political campaigns.\par \par \uc2 The Russian requests come as \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , the Republican nominee, has claimed that the \uc2 election\uc2  will be ''rigged.'' United States officials, including Republican leaders, have forcefully denied that claim.\par \par \uc2 Josh Earnest\uc2 , the White House press secretary, said that it was ''appropriate'' for people to be suspicious of Russia's motives in requesting a presence at American polling stations, according to The Associated Press.\par \par \uc2 In response to Mr. Zakharov's letter, Carlos H. Cascos, the Texas secretary of state, wrote in a letter, dated Sept. 28, ''We are unable to accommodate your request to visit a polling station; however, our office is available to discuss generally the \uc2 election\uc2  process or perhaps facilitate a meeting with local \uc2 election\uc2  officials in \uc2 Harris County\uc2  to go over the general process with your representatives.''\par \par \uc2 Mr. Cascos said that anyone entering a polling place without authorization would be committing a misdemeanor crime.\par \par \uc2 Oklahoma's secretary of state, \uc2 Chris Benge\uc2 , had a similar response to Mr. Zakharov, according to The A.P.\par \par \uc2 ''While it would be our honor to offer the opportunity to observe our voting process, it is prohibited under state law to allow anyone except \uc2 election\uc2  officials and voters in or around the area where voting takes place,'' he wrote.\par \par \uc2 Louisiana's response was more friendly. Tom Schedler, Louisiana's secretary of state, told Mr. Zakharov that the department was short-staffed because of recent flooding.\par \par \uc2 ''Had this flood event not occurred, we certainly would have been open to such a visit, but I cannot meet such a request with the situation I currently have in front of me,'' he wrote.\par \par \uc2 Meg Casper, a spokeswoman for Louisiana's secretary of state, said in an email that the state routinely got requests for foreign \uc2 election\uc2  observers and had hosted some foreign officials.\par \par \uc2 But she also called the Russian request a ''propaganda ploy'' and said the F.B.I. and the \uc2 Department of Homeland Security\uc2  advised against it, according to \uc2 USA Today\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 States have the authority to approve or deny requests by foreign governments to observe elections, said Mark Toner, a State Department spokesman, according to The A.P. He said Russia had not participated in international efforts to observe elections, and the request to the states amounts to ''nothing more than a P.R. stunt.''\par \par \uc2 Document NYTF000020161022ecam0006d\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 ''Such a nasty woman.''\par \par \uc2 Nearing the end of a campaign of disparagement, \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2  coined a classic in the annals of insults against powerful women.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's remark -- which he directed at \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  during the third presidential debate Wednesday as she talked about a particularly nasty topic, Social Security -- had all the makings of a feminist meme. It came across as impulsive and petulant, with sexist undertones, even if it lacked the sophistication of certain predecessors:\par \par \uc2 She has ''the lips of Marilyn Monroe, the eyes of Caligula.'' -- the former French president Fran\u231\'00\'E7ois Mitterrand, about \uc2 Margaret Thatcher\par \par \uc2 Insults are, of course, an inextricable part of politics, and not only directed at women by men. Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  has weathered his fair share this \uc2 election\uc2  (Senator Mark Kirk of Illinois said on \uc2 Twitter\uc2  this month: ''DJT is a malignant clown.'') Some of the most memorable came from women: Dorothy Parker, upon hearing that Calvin Coolidge had died, reportedly said, ''How can they tell?'' Barbara Bush, during the 1984 Reagan-Bush campaign against Walter Mondale, described Geraldine Ferraro, the Democratic vice-presidential nominee, as an ''I can't say it, but it rhymes with rich.'' Mrs. Bush later apologized and claimed the word she was looking for was ''witch.''\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  in particular is an equal opportunity insulter -- just look at the things he said about his male opponents during the primaries.\par \par \uc2 But insults of powerful women by men perform a particular role, researchers say: cutting them down to size, and playing into discomfort with women in power.\par \par \uc2 Historically, there has been a high penalty for explicitly attacking women, said Kathleen Hall Jamieson, professor of communication and director of the \uc2 Annenberg Public Policy Center\uc2  at the \uc2 University of Pennsylvania\uc2 . As a result, rarely are insults of women as overt as ''nasty woman'' or some other \uc2 Trump\uc2  offerings:\par \par \uc2 ''Look at that face! Would anyone vote for that? Can you imagine that, the face of our next president?'' -- Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , about Carly Fiorina\par \par \uc2 Instead, insults have generally been subtler -- and perhaps more pernicious, by playing into people's stereotypes without their knowing it. Calling Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  ''angry,'' as Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  did several times Wednesday, or ''emotional,'' as \uc2 John McCain\uc2  once did, evokes negative gender stereotypes of women as hysterical and irrational, Ms. Jamieson said.\par \par \uc2 By questioning Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's ''stamina,'' Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  implies that she is too weak to be commander in chief. Terms of affection do something similar:\par \par \uc2 ''Calm down, dear.'' -- Prime Minister \uc2 David Cameron\uc2  to \uc2 Angela Eagle\uc2 , a British politician\par \par \uc2 People tend to be most bothered when men and women don't fit the stereotypes they expect -- men as confident, strong leaders and women as humble, cooperative and supportive, according to research by Laurie A. Rudman, a psychologist at Rutgers.\par \par \uc2 Questioning a woman's niceness -- as some people thought \uc2 Barack Obama\uc2  did when he told Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  she was ''likable enough'' in a 2008 debate -- serves that purpose, and also makes it hard for a woman to fight back because she will only appear less kind, Ms. Jamieson said.\par \par \uc2 While women with children have been belittled as not having enough capacity to lead while mothering, women without children also receive blistering criticism for not living up to society's expectations of women.\par \par \uc2 ''Anyone who has chosen to remain deliberately barren, they've got no idea about what life's about.'' -- the Australian senator Bill Heffernan about Julia Gillard, who would go on to become Australia's prime minister\par \par \uc2 Condescension is another common tool for deflating powerful women.\par \par \uc2 [Video: First 1984 US Vice Presidential Debate October 11, 1984 Geraldine Ferraro Vs George H W Bush Watch on \uc2 YouTube\uc2 .]\par \par \uc2 ''Let me help you with the difference, Mrs. Ferraro, between Iran and the Embassy in Lebanon.'' -- George H.W. Bush mansplaining to Ms. Ferraro during a vice-presidential debate\par \par \uc2 Attacking women's appearance serves a dual purpose: the attack itself, and the implication that a woman is valuable for her looks more than her brains. The same goes for sexual remarks, which some people heard in Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's use of the word ''nasty,'' though it's possible he didn't mean the word in that way at all.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  is an expert at targeting a woman's looks, but he's hardly the first to do it.\par \par \uc2 ''\uc2 Michelle Obama\uc2 , her project is obesity. And look at her big butt.'' -- Representative Jim Sensenbrenner, as reported by a bystander. (Mr. Sensenbrenner later apologized.)\par \par \uc2 ''Did you see \uc2 Nancy Pelosi\uc2  on the floor? Complete disgust. If you can get through all the surgeries, there's disgust.'' -- Senator \uc2 Lindsey Graham\uc2 , making a plastic surgery joke\par \par \uc2 ''You're more beautiful than you are intelligent.'' -- the former prime minister \uc2 Silvio Berlusconi\uc2  of Italy, to Rosy Bindi, an opposition member of Parliament\par \par \uc2 Attacking women in power goes back centuries:\par \par \uc2 ''The concubine, the she-devil, the whore.'' -- Eustace Chapuys, imperial ambassador to England, about Anne Boleyn\par \par \uc2 But the thing about gendered insults is that they can backfire, by rallying at least half the population. When Patty Murray was told by a state representative that she couldn't make a difference because she was just ''a mom in tennis shoes,'' she turned around and used it as a campaign slogan that put her in the Senate.\par \par \uc2 The Upshot provides news, analysis and graphics about politics, policy and everyday life.

\par\par \uc2 EDITORIAL\par \uc2 Editorial Desk; SECTA\par \b \uc2 A WikiLeaks Lesson for Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\b0\par\par\uc2 By THE EDITORIAL BOARD \par \uc2 474 \uc2 words\par \uc2 22 October 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 22\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 The consensus by United States intelligence agencies is that the \uc2 WikiLeaks\uc2  dump of emails from the account of \uc2 John Podesta\uc2 , \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's campaign chairman, was the result of a hack by Russia in an effort to influence the presidential \uc2 election\uc2 . The leaks are continuing, so it's impossible to say whether anything truly damaging to Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  will emerge. Some of the purloined exchanges consist of routine and often boring campaign planning, while others seem embarrassing or cynical, as when \uc2 Clinton\uc2  aides debate accepting campaign cash from foreign government lobbyists, and one writes: ''Take the money!!''\par \par \uc2 None of the emails, at least so far, seem particularly harmful to Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , although some suggest that her closest aides have the same concerns that weigh on many Americans -- that she can be thin-skinned and secretive.\par \par \uc2 As Neera Tanden, one of Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's closest advisers, put it in the emails, ''She always sees herself bending to 'their' will when she hands over information.''\par \par \uc2 This is partly because of the endless investigations the Clintons' political enemies have pursued over the years. But that sort of scrutiny will surely intensify if she becomes president. Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  will only stir up her Republican critics by appearing secretive; she has a much better chance of shutting them down, as she did in her Benghazi hearing, with a dogged determination to show she has nothing to hide.\par \par \uc2 Fuller disclosure would clearly have helped her when it came to her lucrative speeches to Wall Street, a matter that has dogged her throughout this campaign. While she has released a full list of her speeches and fees, Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  has consistently refused to release the transcripts. From the snippets seen in the emails, one wonders why.\par \par \uc2 One speech has been politically problematic -- a 2013 presentation to Brazil's Banco Ita\u250\'00\'FA in which she said, ''My dream is a hemispheric common market, with open trade and open borders, some time in the future.'' Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  pounced on this as evidence that Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  favored unfettered immigration -- which seemed misleading given her long support for strong border security.\par \par \uc2 Over all, the excerpts from \uc2 WikiLeaks\uc2  suggest that Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's speeches were what one would expect for audiences interested in global investment: talk about incentivizing growth and spurring entrepreneurship.\par \par \uc2 Imagine if months ago, Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  had done her own giant information release, including hundreds of pages of speeches to \uc2 Goldman Sachs\uc2  and Citi, to \uc2 Salesforce.com\uc2 , the United Fresh Produce Association and the \uc2 Cardiovascular Research Foundation\uc2 . Journalists and the public could have waded through them, discussed them, written about them -- and by now, everyone would have long since moved on.\par \par \uc2 Follow The \uc2 New York Times\uc2  Opinion section on \uc2 Facebook\uc2  and \uc2 Twitter\uc2  (@NYTopinion), and sign up for the Opinion Today newsletter.\par \par \uc2 Document NYTF000020161022ecam0005h\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 The Arts/Cultural Desk; SECT\par \b \uc2 The Playlist: David Bowie's Unreleased Songs and a 'Putin' Satire\b0\par\par\uc2 By JON PARELES, JON CARAMANICA and NATE CHINEN \par \uc2 1,361 \uc2 words\par \uc2 22 October 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 The New York Times on the Web\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Every Friday, pop critics for T he \uc2 New York Times\uc2  weigh in on the week's most notable new songs and videos -- and anything else that strikes them as intriguing. Like this Playlist? Let us know at theplaylist@nytimes.com, and sign up for our Louder newsletter (coming soon!) here.\par \par \uc2 Michael C. Hall, 'Killing a Little Time'\par \par \uc2 [Video: Michael C. Hall - "Killing a Little Time" (Lazarus Cast Recording) Watch on \uc2 YouTube\uc2 .]\par \par \uc2 David Bowie left a postscript to his catalog with ''Lazarus,'' the 2015 musical-theater piece built around his music. The original cast recording includes three previously unheard Bowie songs: ''No Plan,'' ''When I Met You'' and the most angular and enraged of them, ''Killing a Little Time.'' It's a searing tirade at mortality -- ''No sympathy/This furious reign'' -- that could have fit directly onto his final album, ''Blackstar.'' The beat heaves and erupts, the harmonies thicken and bristle with modern-jazz dissonance, and twin-guitar riffs slice crosswise against the dramatic declamation of the melody. Michael C. Hall sings with faithful Bowie inflections, a tribute that only underlines the finality of Bowie's loss. JON PARELES\par \par \uc2 Cole Swindell, 'You've Got My Number'\par \par \uc2 [Video: You've Got My Number Watch on \uc2 YouTube\uc2 .]\par \par \uc2 Somewhere in between the country bro and the country gentleman, two recent Nashville scourges, lives Cole Swindell, who has been too casual to be either. Despite a couple of excellent hit singles -- ''Hope You Get Lonely Tonight'' and ''Ain't Worth the Whiskey,'' which would be ruthlessly bitter if he didn't sing them like children's lullabies -- he's remained committedly banal. ''You've Got My Number,'' his new single, isn't much by way of vocal evolution -- his voice is still thin, processed, neutral. But the production, an excellent approximation of a Jason Aldean song, circa 2008, does what he can't, or won't. It's part country-disco, part churning 1980s monster-rock: ''You know what drink I like/ You know what songs I love,'' Mr. Swindell chirps, while the guitars conduct a demolition derby just behind his head. JON CARAMANICA\par \par \uc2 Valerie June: 'Astral Plane'\par \par \uc2 The down-home goes cosmic in ''Astral Plane,'' a preview of ''The Order of Time,'' the Valerie June album, scheduled to be released on Jan. 27. Anyone who puts ''astral'' in a song title should be aware of Van Morrison's ''Astral Weeks,'' and Valerie June's music certainly is; the core is a gently strummed acoustic guitar, with keyboard tones and muted horns hovering nearby as a snare drum calmly marches the listener toward a benevolent lesson. She sings about seeking the ''light you have inside you,'' patiently but resolutely. ''Follow the signs, slowly but steady/don't rush,'' she suggests; eventually, she promises, you'll be ''dancing on the astral plane/holy water, cleansing rain/floating through the stratosphere.'' Her voice is, as always, a marvel of seeming guilelessness, lightly but firmly shaping the melody while allowing herself scratches, cracks and quavers: imperfection as empathy. J.P.\par \par \uc2 Ari Lennox, 'Cold Outside'\par \par \uc2 Ari Lennox, a luxuriously confident singer signed to J. Cole's Dreamville imprint, has a strong, Badu-esque voice and an even stronger taste for cognitive dissonance. ''Cold Outside,'' one of several strong tracks on her new EP, ''PHO,'' is rife with signifiers of 1990s proto-neo-soul -- soothing tempo; warm, jazz-inflected singing; ever-so-subtle boom-bap production. Just when it seems that the moral righteousness of that era might take hold, there comes the twist: ''Cold Outside'' is about an affair, and a brazen, naughty one at that.\par \par \uc2 I heard you got a girl though\par \par \uc2 what's it got to do with me?\par \par \uc2 She don't have to know\par \par \uc2 I'll meet you quarter-three\par \par \uc2 J.C.\par \par \uc2 Randy Newman, 'Putin'\par \par \uc2 [Video: Randy Newman - "Putin" Watch on \uc2 YouTube\uc2 .]\par \par \uc2 The words ''puppet'' and ''hacker'' are nowhere to be found in Randy Newman's ''Putin.'' But this pomp-filled set piece, featuring a billowy orchestra in razzle-dazzle mode, feels uncannily well timed nevertheless. Mr. Newman -- who even pronounces ''Putin'' with comic flair, as if spitting it into a handkerchief -- depicts the president of Russia, \uc2 Vladimir V. Putin\uc2 , in full shirtless glory, the comic picture of macho bluster. But then comes an unexpectedly sullen inner monologue, in which the great leader dreams of past military glories, perking up only as he realizes that ''Kurds and way'' rhymes with ''curds and whey.'' As is often the case in Mr. Newman's satire, the tone lands somewhere in between scathing and sympathetic, making earnest points amid ridicule. NATE CHINEN\par \par \uc2 Le Tigre: 'I'm With Her'\par \par \uc2 [Video: Le Tigre: "I'm With Her" (Official Music Video) Watch on \uc2 YouTube\uc2 .]\par \par \uc2 Le Tigre, the post-punk, synthesizer-driven, politically minded band formed in 1998 by the riot grrrl firebrand Kathleen Hanna, has regrouped (with Joanne Fateman and JD Samson) after a decade for an urgent last-minute \uc2 election\uc2  message: ''I'm With Her.'' Yes, that's a Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  slogan, and the song smilingly and bluntly stumps for the ''pantsuit-wearing herstorical first-timer.'' As the synthesizers pump and blip, the women sing praise for Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  and sharp digs at Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2 . The video features rallies, protests, cats, dogs and Le Tigre's members declaiming and dancing -- in pantsuits. J.P.\par \par \uc2 Emiliana Torrini and the Colorist, 'Speed of Dark'\par \par \uc2 [Video: The Colorist & Emiliana Torrini - "Speed of Dark" Watch on \uc2 YouTube\uc2 .]\par \par \uc2 Emiliana Torrini, the Icelandic singer-songwriter, recently accepted an invitation to collaborate with the Colorist Orchestra, an eight-piece chamber-pop outfit from Belgium. Their new album, recorded live in concert and set to come out on Dec. 9, will feature a full program of her songs in new arrangements, along with two new tracks. ''Speed of Dark'' offers an early glimpse of the project, opening in atmospheric whooshes and chimes before an electropop beat kicks in. The orchestration forms a dreamy cushion for Ms. Torrini's coolheaded delivery, falling back and then gathering force as she sings a key refrain: ''Life is just a flicker in the universe/Ooh under the stars we're indestructible.'' N.C.\par \par \uc2 Hearts & Minds With Marshall Allen\par \par \uc2 [Video: Hearts * Minds With Marshall Allen Watch on \uc2 YouTube\uc2 .]\par \par \uc2 The bass clarinetist Jason Stein has grown accustomed to playing for big crowds as an opening act for his sister Amy Schumer: this week they appeared at Madison Square Garden, for the second time in just four months. But Mr. Stein hasn't made any commercial accommodations in his music -- neither with Locksmith Isidore, the band on the arena tour, nor with Hearts & Minds, a separate trio with a fine new self-titled album. Hearts & Minds recently played a show at Boot & Saddle, a country-western bar in South Philadelphia, along with an honored guest: Marshall Allen, the 92-year-old saxophonist who leads the Sun Ra Arkestra. A newly posted video captures the restless spark of their improvisation, featuring Mr. Allen's far-out bleeps and tones on EWI, a windblown synthesizer. The clip, handsomely shot and edited, covers a lot of sonic territory in 12 minutes, dropping you right into the developing frenzy; don't miss the funk groove that bubbles up after about the 10-minute mark. N.C.\par \par \uc2 Weyes Blood, 'Generation Why'\par \par \uc2 [Video: Weyes Blood - "Generation Why" Watch on \uc2 YouTube\uc2 .]\par \par \uc2 Natalie Mering, a.k.a. Weyes Blood, sings in a dispassionate alto full of drowsy sensuality, like a goth-folk Karen Carpenter. Her new album, ''Front Row Seat to Earth,'' is full of songs that feel placid on the surface but troubled at the core. And that strangeness is front and center in the video for ''Generation Why,'' which Ms. Mering directed as a dystopian travelogue, shot against a backdrop of beachside decay. There's an allegorical unease about technology and futurism in the song, which the video makes explicit. But there's deadpan wit, too, as when Ms. Mering repeats the only line in the chorus, with funeral gravity: ''Y-O-L-O, why?''

\par\par \uc2 National Desk; SECTA\par \b \uc2 For Some Immigrants, \uc2 Trump\uc2 's Warning on \uc2 Election\uc2  Results Sounds All Too Familiar\b0\par\par\uc2 By YAMICHE ALCINDOR \par \uc2 912 \uc2 words\par \uc2 22 October 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 12\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Many voters saw it as a historic breach of tradition when \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2  refused to say this week that he would accept the result of the \uc2 election\uc2  if he lost.\par \par \uc2 For Maria Julia Echart, who grew up in Argentina, it felt historic in another way.\par \par \uc2 She said it reminded her of how her native country's military ousted its democratically elected president in 1976, and how after the ruling junta began to kill activists, her family went into hiding. She remembered sleeping on the floor in a bare apartment with her mother, and being so scared that she once wet her pants.\par \par \uc2 ''I never thought in a million years this country would go through this after coming from Argentina,'' said Ms. Echart, 62, who moved to the United States in 1987.\par \par \uc2 Fairly or not, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's critics have painted him as being unwelcoming to immigrants, dating back to his calls for mass deportations and for building a wall along the border with Mexico. But his most recent comments about the legitimacy of the \uc2 election\uc2 , with their whiff of third-world tumult, have perversely made some immigrants feel right at home.\par \par \uc2 ''When I hear him saying he's not sure he's going to respect the results of the \uc2 election\uc2 , it makes me think of the period of dictatorship in the Dominican Republic when politicians didn't respect the will of the people,'' said Nieves Padilla, 60, an organizer with Make the Road Action, a New York-based immigrant advocacy group, who came to the United States in 1975.\par \par \uc2 Few would go so far as to predict mass violence or coups d'\u233\'00\'E9tat if Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  lost and refused to concede, given the country's loyalty to the rule of law.\par \par \uc2 But it was precisely America's reputation as a role model for democracy that made the candidate's comments so jarring for some naturalized citizens. In their minds, they said, questions about a president's legitimacy were inseparable from chaos and bloodshed, and thus they could not stop themselves from thinking the worst.\par \par \uc2 ''He said, 'I will concede only if I win?' My goodness,'' said Cristina Drost, 82, a retired teacher in Henderson, Nev. She said she immigrated from the Philippines in 1961 after her uncle, while running for Congress there, was shot by people who did not think he should be in the race. (He survived.) ''It is encouraging his supporters who could do some drastic things like killing, especially today since people have guns,'' she said of Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's comments.\par \par \uc2 From his living room in Queens, Francois Pierre-Louis said he could hardly believe that a major-party candidate in the United States was hinting that he might question the will of voters before the results had even been announced.\par \par \uc2 But Mr. Pierre-Louis, 56, is used to such talk. He grew up in Haiti, which has cycled through dictators and contested elections for decades. Mr. Pierre-Louis said Fran\u231\'00\'E7ois Duvalier killed all four of his mother's brothers and many of his male cousins because one of his uncles had openly opposed the dictator and his regime.\par \par \uc2 ''Can you imagine that the United States is going to be a third-world country in the sense that the most prominent candidate of a major party is going to contest the \uc2 election\uc2 ?'' Mr. Pierre-Louis said.\par \par \uc2 Former President \uc2 Jimmy Carter\uc2 , whose organization the \uc2 Carter Center\uc2  is known worldwide for \uc2 election\uc2  monitoring, has gone so far as to assure people that Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's complaints about the American voting process should not cause worry.\par \par \uc2 ''The \uc2 Carter Center\uc2  has observed more than 100 elections around the world, some of them quite problematic,'' he said in a statement released by the organization. ''However, allegations of potential rigging of U.S. elections, as well as of widespread voter fraud, are baseless, serving only to undermine confidence in our democratic processes and inflame tensions.''\par \par \uc2 Since the debate, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  has both reinforced his remarks -- telling a crowd in Ohio that he would accept the results ''if I win'' -- and dialed them back, saying he would ''follow and abide by all the rules and traditions.''\par \par \uc2 And if his words have jarred some foreign-born voters into wondering if they were back in their native countries, others had no problem envisioning where Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  was coming from.\par \par \uc2 Alice Backer, 42, a Brooklyn lawyer who grew up in Haiti and has been critical of \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's actions in Haiti while secretary of state, did not leave her jaded view of elections behind when she came to the United States.\par \par \uc2 ''I think that anyone who does not look at the results of these elections with some skepticism is probably not exercising critical thinking,'' said Ms. Backer, who plans to vote for the Green Party nominee, Jill Stein. ''If indeed \uc2 Trump\uc2  finds that there is evidence that the results of the coming \uc2 election\uc2  will be fraudulent, I'm not going to be particularly surprised.''\par \par \uc2 Find out what you need to know about the 2016 presidential race today, and get politics news updates via \uc2 Facebook\uc2 , \uc2 Twitter\uc2  and the First Draft newsletter.\par \par \uc2 Francois Pierre-Louis, left, of Queens, who grew up in Haiti, and Nieves Padilla of Brooklyn, a native of the Dominican Republic.

\par\par \uc2 Metropolitan Desk; SECTA\par \b \uc2 Nassau Official's Arrest Raises Democratic Hopes of Gains in State Senate\b0\par\par\uc2 By JESSE McKINLEY \par \uc2 1,204 \uc2 words\par \uc2 22 October 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 20\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 ALBANY -- The corruption scandal enveloping the Nassau County executive has given Democrats a new and potent line of attack, as they try to gain control of the narrowly divided New York Senate.\par \par \uc2 The executive, Edward P. Mangano, a Republican, was arrested by federal agents on Thursday along with his wife, Linda Mangano, and the Oyster Bay town supervisor, John Venditto, also a Republican. All were charged with a scheme that included government contracts, bribery, kickbacks and a no-show job involving food tasting.\par \par \uc2 The charges sent ripples through the county on Long Island, where Mr. Mangano wielded much influence through a warm relationship with members of the Republican establishment as well as with \uc2 Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo\uc2 , a Democrat whom he endorsed across party lines in 2014. (Mr. Cuomo has had no comment on the arrest.)\par \par \uc2 Mr. Mangano's arrest also has many Democratic leaders dreaming of a countywide sweep, noting that their party enjoys a slight advantage in voter registration and that they hope to use the corruption scandal in tandem with efforts to tie Republican candidates to \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , who they believe has alienated moderate suburban voters.\par \par \uc2 ''Nassau County was a focal point for us this fall just because the demographics and the presidential race were making it competitive,'' said Senator Michael N. Gianaris of Queens, the Senate Democrats' chief political strategist. ''And with all our candidates stressing ethics reform and corruption as our main message, recent events make it more favorable than ever.''\par \par \uc2 There are perhaps 10 competitive races statewide that could tip the balance of power in the Senate, where the math of majority can be hard to follow: The 63-seat chamber actually includes 32 Democrats, but one Democrat -- Senator Simcha Felder of Brooklyn -- caucuses with the Republicans, giving that party power.\par \par \uc2 Democrats hope to pick up at least one seat to seize the majority, but even so, they also will probably have to work with the Independent Democratic Conference, a breakaway group of Democratic senators who have often worked closely with Republicans.\par \par \uc2 But the Democrats are aiming larger, focusing on seemingly safe Republican seats like the Eighth District on the South Shore of Long Island. But because that district is held by Senator Michael Venditto, the son of John Venditto, Democrats feel that the electoral map has expanded.\par \par \uc2 On Thursday, Democrats began new internal polling in the Eighth District on behalf of their candidate, John E. Brooks, to determine a path to victory. And on Friday, Mr. Brooks unveiled a four-point ethics plan, saying that ''corrupt officials have lined their pockets at the expense of Long Island taxpayers, and people like Senator Mike Venditto have stood by and let it happen.''\par \par \uc2 As Mr. Gianaris suggested, the issue of corruption had already been in play in several Nassau races, including the Ninth District, which was touched by scandal last year as well: It is the former seat of Dean G. Skelos, a Republican who was the Senate majority leader before being convicted of federal corruption charges in December. The incumbent, Todd Kaminsky, a Democrat who won a special \uc2 election\uc2  in April, is a former federal prosecutor, which has been highlighted in his campaign ads.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Kaminsky wasted little time calling for Mr. Mangano and John Venditto's resignations, along with a ''wholesale ethics reform.''\par \par \uc2 ''Pay-to-play politics is disgraceful,'' Mr. Kaminsky said in a statement released on Thursday. ''And taxpayers deserve better.''\par \par \uc2 That call was echoed by every other Democratic Senate candidate in the county -- each used the phrase ''resign immediately'' -- and placed Republicans in an awkward position of doing the same. This included Mr. Kaminsky's opponent, Chris McGrath, a lawyer and Hofstra University law professor, who said in an interview that ''the public deserves someone who will give 100 percent of their time to the job.''\par \par \uc2 Republican officials noted that all five of their candidates also called for resignations and denounced the alleged behavior outlined by Robert L. Capers, the United States attorney for the Eastern District of New York.\par \par \uc2 ''We have zero tolerance for corruption of any kind, regardless of whether it is committed by a Democrat or a Republican,'' said Scott Reif, a spokesman for the Senate Republicans. ''Over the next few weeks, we are going to remind people of the comprehensive ethics reforms we have already achieved, and that we are committed to doing more to ensure citizens have faith and trust in their government at every level.''\par \par \uc2 Among those distancing themselves from Mr. Mangano and Mr. Venditto was Carl L. Marcellino, a Republican whose district includes parts of the more conservative Suffolk County and who is in a battle with \uc2 James Gaughran\uc2 , a Democrat. In a \uc2 Facebook\uc2  post on Thursday, Senator Marcellino also expressed doubts about Mr. Venditto and Mr. Mangano's ability to ''effectively lead the county or town and represent the people in the manner they deserve with this cloud over their heads.''\par \par \uc2 Mr. Gaughran, the chairman of the Suffolk County Water Authority, had already tried to make ethics a part of the race, with campaign mailers arriving this week that characterize Mr. Marcellino, who has deep ties to Oyster Bay, as part of a ''corrupt political machine.''\par \par \uc2 Democrats are also optimistic about the Sixth District, where the Republican incumbent, Kemp Hannon, is facing Ryan Cronin in a rematch of a 2012 race. Senator Hannon won that race by fewer than 5,000 votes.\par \par \uc2 In the Seventh District, the incumbent senator, Jack M. Martins, is leaving to run for Congress. The resulting race pits Adam Haber, a Nassau businessman whom Senator Martins handily defeated in 2014, against Elaine Phillips, the mayor of the village of Flower Hill, on the North Shore.\par \par \uc2 Craig Burnett, an assistant professor of political science at Hofstra who has studied the Senate races, said that Mr. Marcellino and Mr. Venditto's seats should be safely Republican, but that the arrests could complicate that, even if the incumbents are state officials and not county. ''Voters don't necessarily make these distinctions,'' Professor Burnett said, adding, ''They know that there's people on the ballot and that's the only way they have to express themselves.''\par \par \uc2 He added that Mr. Kaminsky's victory in April over Mr. McGrath in the Ninth District showed that solid Republican seats could flip. ''There is evidence there that this can be done,'' he said.\par \par \uc2 Professor Burnett and others said the younger Mr. Venditto, a first-term legislator, could lose votes from those who confuse him with his recently arrested father. Mr. Venditto offered an emotional statement on Thursday about the arrest, calling it ''an extremely difficult situation for our entire family.''\par \par \uc2 ''It is breaking our hearts,'' he said in the statement, noting that John Venditto should be considered innocent until proven guilty. ''I love my father.''\par \par \uc2 Edward Mangano, top, a Republican who is the Nassau County executive, was arrested this week. State Senator Michael Gianaris of Queens, above left, said that could help Democrats. One Republican senator they hope to unseat is Kemp Hannon, above right.

Still Sees No Evil\b0\par\par\uc2 By JULIET MACUR \par \uc2 1,092 \uc2 words\par \uc2 22 October 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 1\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Television ratings for the N.F.L. are down 11 percent this season, and league officials have been grasping for possible explanations.\par \par \uc2 To some extent, they blame the presidential \uc2 election\uc2 . Some fans have tuned out football, they theorize, to tune in to a political race in which sexual assault and the treatment of women have been front and center, thanks to Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , the Republican nominee who has bragged about groping and kissing women without their consent.\par \par \uc2 Those issues are important to some people, like -- and this is just a guess here -- women. And anyone else with even a sliver of decency.\par \par \uc2 But how important are those issues to the N.F.L.? Yet again, in the case of Giants kicker Josh Brown, the league has shown that it could not care less about women and really, really doesn't want to call out its players for doing bad things to them.\par \par \uc2 Brown was arrested in 2015 and was charged with assaulting his wife at the time, Molly. Police and court records documented that Brown had assaulted her nearly two dozen times, including at least once, Molly Brown said, when she was pregnant.\par \par \uc2 The league investigated the matter for 10 months, sending in its crack investigative team, whose stated goal is to dig and dig for the truth. In the end, Brown was suspended for one game. One. A mere hiccup in the season. Apparently the N.F.L.'s investigators didn't find much, and after the fact, the league blamed the victim. Brown's wife had failed to cooperate, the league said, and that's why its investigators couldn't get to the bottom of what he had done.\par \par \uc2 If the N.F.L. has studied domestic violence cases at all since the Ray Rice debacle two years ago, it should know that putting the onus on an abused woman to make the case against her abuser -- to the abuser's employer, no less -- is not exactly considered best practice.\par \par \uc2 The sheriff in charge of Brown's case, John Urquhart, even rebuked the N.F.L. on Thursday for its feeble attempt at getting the facts in the case.\par \par \uc2 He told KIRO, a Seattle radio station, that the N.F.L. never officially asked for documents. He said that two people he considered random -- but who he subsequently learned worked at the league -- had made document requests, which were denied. But had Urquhart known it was the N.F.L. asking, things would have turned out differently, he said.\par \par \uc2 ''Since this is a hot-button item in the N.F.L., since it's the N.F.L., we probably would have told them orally a little bit more about what we had,'' he said.\par \par \uc2 But even if you move past the N.F.L.'s track record in investigating and punishing players accused of violence against women, you would think that the Giants might have cared about Brown's background enough to do some digging themselves. Turns out, though, they didn't have to. The Giants knew about Brown's past, even before they re-signed him before the season.\par \par \uc2 ''He's admitted to us that he's abused his wife in the past,'' the Giants co-owner John K. Mara said Thursday on WFAN in New York. ''And I think that's what's a little unclear, is the extent of that.''\par \par \uc2 So Mara decided it was O.K. for a player to abuse his wife just a little bit?\par \par \uc2 Now the N.F.L. is backpedaling once again. After details of the case were made public this week, the league said that it was reopening Brown's case. Some of the details the N.F.L. now can see in black and white are these: Brown, in journals he kept, admitted abusing his wife and viewing her as his slave.\par \par \uc2 ''I have controlled her by making her feel less human than me,'' Brown wrote.\par \par \uc2 He added, ''I have disregarded my stepsons' feelings, and they have witnessed me abusing their mother.''\par \par \uc2 The league's new and so-called improved domestic violence policy calls for a six-game suspension without pay for a first-time offender, and for a more severe penalty if ''the act was committed against a pregnant woman or in the presence of a child.''\par \par \uc2 Now, just as in the Ray Rice case, the eyes of the public are on the N.F.L. to see what it does to make things right. So far, its actions haven't matched its words.\par \par \uc2 Instead, its inaction once again has forced others to take a vocal stand. Even some players' mothers, for goodness' sake.\par \par \uc2 Annie Apple, the mother of Giants cornerback Eli Apple, took Mara to task for treating domestic violence lightly.\par \par \uc2 ''As a domestic violence survivor, reading these Mara comments makes me sad, angry and completely baffled,'' she wrote Thursday on \uc2 Twitter\uc2 . ''He just doesn't get it. This is sad.''\par \par \uc2 And then there's \uc2 Melissa Mark-Viverito\uc2 , the speaker of the New York City Council. She is a casual sports fan upset about the way local professional teams have treated players accused of domestic violence -- players like pitcher Aroldis Chapman, whom the \uc2 Yankees\uc2  acquired last December even though he was being investigated for domestic violence. They traded him in July. By then, Mark-Viverito had decided to do something about it.\par \par \uc2 Over the past several months, she spearheaded a public service campaign, #NotAFan, featuring top athletes and coaches, including Yankees Manager \uc2 Joe Girardi\uc2 , speaking out against domestic violence. The campaign's videos were shown at Citi Field before the Mets' wild-card game, and they will begin appearing in New York City taxis Monday.\par \par \uc2 Nearly every big-time local team agreed to participate, but two did not. The Giants and the Jets, Mark-Viverito told me, refused to take part.\par \par \uc2 ''The buy-in was pretty immediate from most teams,'' she said. ''I don't know why they declined.''\par \par \uc2 The N.F.L. does so many things that are inexplicable or inexcusable. But the way it treats women and the men who abuse them is on top of that list.\par \par \uc2 The N.F.L. has proved that it simply doesn't care.\par \par \uc2 Email: juliet@nytimes.com\par \par \uc2 The N.F.L. blamed the victim of domestic abuse by the Giants' Josh Brown for not cooperating with its 10-month inquiry, which missed central facts.

\par\par \uc2 National Desk; SECTA\par \b \uc2 Key Nevada Senate Race Shifts to Ground Game: Knocking on Doors\b0\par\par\uc2 By EMMARIE HUETTEMAN \par \uc2 1,336 \uc2 words\par \uc2 22 October 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 14\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 LAS VEGAS -- For all the millions of dollars spent on this \uc2 election\uc2 , the outcome may come down to people like Megan Blas.\par \par \uc2 A 25-year-old college student who grew up in Guam, Ms. Blas spends up to 32 hours each week knocking on doors, canvassing voters and logging responses. There are hundreds like her in Nevada, which is serving as a fierce proxy fight for the ground war between outside groups supporting Democrats and Republicans. They are using advanced analytics and old-fashioned legwork to meet the most basic of \uc2 election\uc2  objectives: turning out the vote.\par \par \uc2 For years, outside groups have been building political organizations that target voters in highly refined segments, then make a final push to get their supporters to the polls, in many cases supplanting the role once played by political parties. It has become as much science as art, with mass accumulations of data. But in the final weeks, it is human contact from people like Ms. Blas that can make the difference in a close \uc2 election\uc2  like the Senate race here.\par \par \uc2 Ms. Blas works for a Democratic-aligned ''super PAC,'' For Our Future, reaching out to Asian-Americans and Pacific Islanders scattered across Las Vegas. One afternoon last week, she hopped out of a charcoal-gray \uc2 Mazda\uc2  and headed up the sidewalk past rows of identical tile-roofed condominiums, looking for the solitary dot on her cellphone map that identified a potential voter's name, age and gender.\par \par \uc2 Republican-aligned groups have their own well-funded, grass-roots army. Marcos Lopez, 22, works for \uc2 Americans for Prosperity\uc2 , a conservative group financed largely by the billionaire brothers Charles G. and \uc2 David H. Koch\uc2 , which has been building an extensive get-out-the-vote operation for several \uc2 election\uc2  cycles. ''The beautiful thing about A.F.P. I love in particular is that I never have to go against my own values and my own beliefs,'' Mr. Lopez said as he knocked on doors in a tidy retirement community in the warm October sunshine, a \uc2 CamelBak\uc2  pack strapped to his back.\par \par \uc2 For many voters, the advertising that has saturated their television screens and filled their mailboxes for months has become almost white noise, and it is the personal touch of a conversation with a canvasser that can have a greater impact.\par \par \uc2 ''At some point, it all becomes static,'' said Adam Jones, \uc2 Americans for Prosperity\uc2 's Nevada director, spreading a messy stack of glossy campaign mailers across his desk.\par \par \uc2 The Senate race in Nevada is among a handful of contests that could determine control of Congress.\par \par \uc2 Conservative and liberal organizations -- many backed by well-known, deep-pocketed benefactors like the Kochs, \uc2 Tom Steyer\uc2  and \uc2 George Soros\uc2  -- have already sunk more than $54 million into the Nevada race, according to the \uc2 Center for Responsive Politics\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 More than 85 percent of Nevada voters live in the Las Vegas area, a sprawling city still recovering from the 2008 housing crisis that has left a transient population. Voter rolls, particularly for Latinos, who could make up 20 percent of the state's voters, have been rendered relatively unreliable.\par \par \uc2 That has not stopped the legions of canvassers, who this weekend will begin urging voters to cast their ballots early at trailers in the parking lot of their local \uc2 Home Depot\uc2  or Albertsons, among other locations.\par \par \uc2 Much of the attention is focused on the Senate race. Republicans are hoping that Representative Joe Heck will win the seat held by Senator Harry Reid, the retiring Democratic leader. But Mr. Reid fervently wants Democrats to keep the seat he has held for 30 years and strongly supports Catherine Cortez Masto, a former Nevada attorney general.\par \par \uc2 There are some signs that the Democrats' ground game is prevailing. By the end of September, they led Republicans in registered voters in Nevada by more than 77,000. President Obama is expected to campaign here on Sunday for Ms. Cortez Masto and his preferred successor, \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 It may well be voters' views of \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , though, that determine the outcomes.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Heck recently called on the Republican presidential nominee to withdraw from the race after the release of a recording in which Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  boasted about sexually assaulting women in vulgar terms.\par \par \uc2 This year many conservative groups have decided to stay out of the presidential race. In Nevada, \uc2 Americans for Prosperity\uc2  and the Libre Initiative, another free-market-devoted group backed by the Koch brothers, have instead focused on defeating Ms. Cortez Masto, spending more than $400,000 so far.\par \par \uc2 Other groups have spent millions running ads in Las Vegas's expensive media market, investing in broader efforts to try to sway the race over voter turnout. The Senate Majority PAC, a group with connections to Mr. Reid that is helping Democratic Senate candidates, has spent more than $5.4 million here. Another super PAC with ties to the Koch brothers, the Freedom Partners Action Fund, has spent more than $7.6 million on the Senate race -- more than either party's campaign committee.\par \par \uc2 The appeal of outside groups is especially apparent as many Republicans struggle to reconcile their values with a presidential nominee who does not share all of theirs.\par \par \uc2 ''When you invest in ideas and principles, those aren't going to let you down,'' Mr. Jones said.\par \par \uc2 Americans for Prosperity\uc2  has dispatched more than 600 unpaid volunteers in Nevada in the past two months to the doors of potentially undecided voters, armed with GPS-enabled iPads loaded with voter data and talking points about Ms. Cortez Masto's record, Mr. Jones said.\par \par \uc2 For Our Future, which is affiliated with Mr. Steyer's NextGen Climate, the A.F.L.-C.I.O. and three major unions, is spending to try to keep pace, with much of the money devoted to canvassing. Last week alone, the group spent more than $52,000 in Nevada, while \uc2 Americans for Prosperity\uc2  spent more than $28,000, according to the \uc2 Center for Responsive Politics\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Some of that money is used to pay For Our Future's canvassers -- $15 to $17 an hour, with health insurance.\par \par \uc2 For Our Future and its local partners use MiniVAN, an app used in recent elections that provides voter registration information and allows Democratic organizers to track their canvassers in real time. As Ms. Blas went from house to house, she used her cellphone to update the app, which syncs automatically to allow other canvassers to use their information and revisit people most likely to vote for Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  and Ms. Cortez Masto.\par \par \uc2 Success is measured in ''attempts,'' or doors knocked. By last week, For Our Future had knocked on about 376,000 doors in Nevada, according to its state officials.\par \par \uc2 ''We want quality and quantity,'' Hector Rivera, a regional field director, told a group of recruits. ''We don't want people sounding like robots,'' he added. ''Or \uc2 Marco Rubio\uc2 .''\par \par \uc2 Come \uc2 Election\uc2  Day, canvassers will knock on the doors of those who did not cast their ballots during the 14-day early voting period to urge them to go to the polls. And while the paycheck may appeal to her, Ms. Blas, after having a door slammed in her face, said she owes much of her motivation to Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 ''I'd want to do anything I can to make sure he doesn't become president because he doesn't seem to care very much for other people besides himself,'' she said.\par \par \uc2 Follow The \uc2 New York Times\uc2 's politics and Washington coverage on \uc2 Facebook\uc2  and \uc2 Twitter\uc2 , and sign up for the First Draft politics newsletter.\par \par \uc2 Michael Jardine, left, and Marcos Lopez, right, visited Bert Weinman while canvassing homes in Las Vegas this month on behalf of Americans for Prosperity. Below, Hector Rivera, a regional field director for the ''super PAC'' For Our Future, at a training session for canvassers. Right, a sign at a home in Las Vegas.

\par\par \uc2 Business/Financial Desk; SECTA\par \b \uc2 AT&T Aims for an Empire With \uc2 Time Warner\b0\par\par\uc2 By LESLIE PICKER, ANDREW ROSS SORKIN and EMILY STEEL; Michael J. de la Merced and Cecilia Kang contributed reporting. \par \uc2 1,260 \uc2 words\par \uc2 22 October 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 1\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 For companies that sell consumers cable and internet service, merely distributing entertainment and programs is not enough. They want to own them.\par \par \uc2 The media conglomerate \uc2 Time Warner\uc2 , which owns \uc2 HBO\uc2 , \uc2 CNN\uc2  and the movie studio \uc2 Warner Bros\uc2 ., has long been among the most prized takeover targets.\par \par \uc2 It is being courted by \uc2 AT&T\uc2 , a telecommunications giant that lacks ownership of any of the shows and videos it delivers through its various businesses. The two are in advanced talks for \uc2 AT&T\uc2  to acquire \uc2 Time Warner\uc2 , and a deal may be announced as early as Monday, according to people with knowledge of the discussions.\par \par \uc2 A merger would come at a pivotal time in the communications industry, where the giants are scrambling to create entertainment empires to maintain competitiveness as consumers increasingly embrace cheaper, digital alternatives.\par \par \uc2 More combinations, possibly involving \uc2 Comcast\uc2 , \uc2 Viacom\uc2  or Apple, could reshape the media landscape. Already, the family that controls \uc2 Viacom\uc2  and \uc2 CBS\uc2  has asked their boards to study a possible merger, a deal that could happen before the end of the year.\par \par \uc2 Regulators have been wary of allowing combinations of businesses that could create less competition and thwart innovation by start-ups, and a tie-up of \uc2 AT&T\uc2  and \uc2 Time Warner\uc2  could raise concerns. It is a bold move in an \uc2 election\uc2  year that will usher in a new administration and a fresh set of regulators.\par \par \uc2 Time Warner\uc2  is asking \uc2 AT&T\uc2  to pay more than $90 a share in the deal, said the people who asked not to be named because the details are still private.\par \par \uc2 At a minimum, that amount, which would put the price around $70 billion, would make this deal the largest of the year, surpassing \uc2 Bayer AG\uc2 's $56 billion takeover of \uc2 Monsanto\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 The transaction is not yet final and may fall apart or get delayed, said the people with knowledge of the discussions. Representatives from \uc2 Time Warner\uc2  and \uc2 AT&T\uc2  declined to comment.\par \par \uc2 A combination with \uc2 AT&T\uc2  would be an about-face from \uc2 Time Warner\uc2 's strategy just seven years ago. The company divested \uc2 Time Warner Cable\uc2  in 2009, and \uc2 Time Inc\uc2 . in 2014, in order to focus on developing programs and entertainment.\par \par \uc2 But since then, other cable providers have teamed up with media companies. \uc2 Comcast\uc2  agreed to acquire NBC Universal from \uc2 General Electric Company\uc2  for about $30 billion in 2009. \uc2 Verizon\uc2  acquired the aging internet property \uc2 AOL\uc2  last year for $4.4 billion and signed a $4.8 billion deal to acquire the core business of another older internet firm, \uc2 Yahoo\uc2 , earlier this year.\par \par \uc2 The terms of the \uc2 AT&T\uc2  transaction will most likely be higher than the $85-a-share price that \uc2 21st Century Fox\uc2  was willing to pay for \uc2 Time Warner\uc2  two years ago. \uc2 Time Warner\uc2  spurned the proposal, saying it could create more value for shareholders by staying independent, and \uc2 21st Century Fox\uc2 , led by \uc2 Rupert Murdoch\uc2 , withdrew the offer.\par \par \uc2 AT&T\uc2 's interest in \uc2 Time Warner\uc2  comes more than two years after it announced a $48.5 billion deal for \uc2 DirecTV\uc2 , the nation's largest satellite television provider. The merger created the country's largest television distributor with about 26 million subscribers, surpassing \uc2 Comcast\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Still, \uc2 AT&T\uc2  has historically been less aggressive than its peers in building a content empire. It was a losing bidder for \uc2 Yahoo\uc2 , for example.\par \par \uc2 But it has had some exposure to content. By purchasing \uc2 DirecTV\uc2 , \uc2 AT&T\uc2  obtained the rights to N.F.L. Sunday Ticket, giving customers access to football game broadcasts. The company also created a joint venture in 2014 with the Chernin Group to invest in media businesses and start internet streaming video services.\par \par \uc2 AT&T\uc2  has a tendency to acquire industry leaders. In the media world that would be \uc2 Time Warner\uc2  and \uc2 Disney\uc2 , and \uc2 Disney\uc2 's $150 billion market valuation makes it a much larger takeover to swallow. Two other companies, \uc2 Viacom\uc2  and \uc2 CBS\uc2 , both controlled by the Redstone family, have been exploring a reunification.\par \par \uc2 The biggest question posed by analysts after Bloomberg News first reported the talks on Thursday is whether or not this transaction would pass regulatory muster. Regulators including the \uc2 Federal Communications Commission\uc2  and the Justice Department have historically been skeptical of similar combinations.\par \par \uc2 ''At best, we believe a lengthy antitrust review of T/TWX with an uncertain outcome may give both sides pause on considering a combination,'' \uc2 Credit Suisse\uc2  research analysts wrote in a note on Thursday using the ticker symbols for \uc2 AT&T\uc2  and \uc2 Time Warner\uc2 . ''At worst, it may act as a barrier to a deal being proposed, in our view.''\par \par \uc2 Additionally, it is an audacious move with the presidential \uc2 election\uc2  just around the corner, which will most likely yield a reshaping of the top regulators that will study this deal. Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  has promised to be tough on corporate mega-powers and consolidation within industries. Most analysts have surmised that a deal between \uc2 AT&T\uc2  and \uc2 Time Warner\uc2  would carry a significant amount of regulatory scrutiny.\par \par \uc2 For \uc2 Jeff Bewkes\uc2 , the chief executive of Time Warner, signing a deal may be worth the risk, if \uc2 AT&T\uc2  is willing to pay both a high enough price and a generous breakup fee in the event that the combination is blocked, said Richard S. Greenfield, an analyst at BTIG.\par \par \uc2 The last comparable merger, involving \uc2 Comcast\uc2 's purchase of \uc2 NBCUniversal\uc2 , was approved by the Justice Department and the F.C.C., but \uc2 Comcast\uc2 's attempt to purchase \uc2 Time Warner Cable\uc2  was blocked by regulators.\par \par \uc2 In addition to the potential regulatory challenges, an acquisition of \uc2 Time Warner\uc2  would be a large one for \uc2 AT&T\uc2  to digest. The combined company would have about $150 billion worth of debt, with around $175 billion in annual revenue. In a low-interest rate environment, financing of such large deals has been more prudent.\par \par \uc2 Some analysts are skeptical that \uc2 AT&T\uc2  could handle the deal. \uc2 AT&T\uc2  has said its ''plate is full'' in absorbing \uc2 DirecTV\uc2 , \uc2 Mike McCormack\uc2 , an analyst with Jefferies, said in a note.\par \par \uc2 Time Warner\uc2  itself is no stranger to slicing and merging. The company is a byproduct of a merger between \uc2 Time Inc\uc2 . and \uc2 Warner Communications\uc2  in 1989, which created the largest media conglomerate in the world at the time, with cable, publishing and movie assets. Seven years later, the company acquired \uc2 Turner Broadcasting\uc2 , bringing the cable network \uc2 CNN\uc2  under its wing.\par \par \uc2 In 2000, \uc2 Time Warner\uc2  merged with \uc2 AOL\uc2 , a combination that has since been seen as one of the largest mistakes ever in deal making. Nine years later, \uc2 Time Warner\uc2  said it would spin off \uc2 AOL\uc2  at a fraction of its valuation after the dot-com bubble burst.\par \par \uc2 These days, \uc2 Time Warner\uc2 's units comprise premium channels such as \uc2 HBO\uc2  and Cinemax, as well as Turner, which operates \uc2 TBS\uc2 , Turner Sports and others, in addition to \uc2 CNN\uc2 . \uc2 Time Warner\uc2  also runs \uc2 Warner Bros. Entertainment\uc2 , which released movies including ''Sully,'' ''Storks'' and ''Suicide Squad'' this year.\par \par \uc2 If the deal between \uc2 AT&T\uc2  and \uc2 Time Warner\uc2  succeeds, other media and entertainment companies could become takeover targets. Many stocks in that industry gained on Friday as more reports surfaced about the deal.\par \par \uc2 Time Warner\uc2 's shares gained 7.8 percent on Friday to $89.48, while \uc2 AT&T\uc2 's declined 3 percent to $37.49.\par \par \uc2 Time Warner's headquarters in New York.

\par\par \uc2 National Desk; SECTA\par \b \uc2 Disputing Vote Is an Uphill Battle\b0\par\par\uc2 By NICK CORASANITI \par \uc2 856 \uc2 words\par \uc2 22 October 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 12\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 It was the most searing moment of the final presidential debate, plastered across newspaper front pages and dominating the cable news: \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's warning that he might not accept the results of the presidential \uc2 election\uc2  if he felt it was ''rigged'' against him.\par \par \uc2 He clarified his stance on Thursday, saying in Ohio that he would not dispute a win or loss by a wide margin, ''but I would also reserve my right to contest or file a legal challenge in the case of a questionable result.''\par \par \uc2 Should either candidate refuse to accept the outcome on Nov. 8, there are a number of ways he or she could try to change it, but they are nearly all on a state-by-state basis; the electoral process is exceptionally decentralized and lacking in uniformity.\par \par \uc2 Doing so in more than one state would be a mammoth and expensive undertaking; the 2000 recount, after all, only involved Florida.\par \par \uc2 And the loser would not be operating in a vacuum: Should Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  seek to overturn his defeat by \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , for example, she and a united Democratic Party could be counted on to fight tooth and nail to see that it is not reversed.\par \par \uc2 Refusing to concede\par \par \uc2 No concession -- whether in a public speech or a private phone call -- is formally required of the losing candidate in a presidential \uc2 election\uc2 ; only tradition and civility demand it. But especially in a race that is not close, withholding a concession could add to the toxicity of the political environment and threaten the ability of the winner to govern.\par \par \uc2 As a practical matter, conceding removes the initial pressure for a speedy official count of the vote to be conducted, said Richard L. Hasen, a professor and \uc2 election\uc2  law expert at the University of California. Legally, the results tabulated and reported on \uc2 election\uc2  night are considered ''preliminary'' in most states; it can take states a few days or sometimes weeks to determine the official count of polling-place and absentee ballots.\par \par \uc2 Demanding a recount\par \par \uc2 The laws regarding recounts vary state by state. In some, when a vote falls within a certain margin, an automatic recount is set off. In Florida and Pennsylvania, that threshold is one-half of 1 percent; in Ohio, it is one-fourth of 1 percent for a statewide \uc2 election\uc2 . A candidate may also request a recount when the margin is larger, but in most states, the campaign requesting it must shoulder the cost of the recount.\par \par \uc2 Contesting a state's \uc2 election\par \par \uc2 Contesting a state's \uc2 election\uc2  is a much more difficult undertaking than merely seeking a recount. If the losing campaign believes that the vote in one or more states was inaccurately counted, or that voter fraud may have occurred, with ineligible votes being cast or eligible votes being rejected -- and in large enough numbers to swing the outcome -- then it could move for a special judicial proceeding under state law, known as an \uc2 election\uc2  contest.\par \par \uc2 But it would need to muster persuasive evidence to halt any vote-certification process, and quickly, according to \uc2 Benjamin L. Ginsberg\uc2 , an \uc2 election\uc2  lawyer who represented George W. Bush against Al Gore in their 2000 standoff.\par \par \uc2 And it would need to contest the results in as many states as are necessary to flip the result of the \uc2 election\uc2  -- and possibly more, to cover its bets.\par \par \uc2 Persuading the electors\par \par \uc2 Election\uc2  Day is Nov. 8, but the Electoral College does not meet until December. Theoretically, the loser of the national \uc2 election\uc2  could try to persuade electors to ignore the wishes of their states's voters. But this would be exceptionally difficult.\par \par \uc2 Its members are chosen in each state: If Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  carries that state, the Republican slate is elected, and if Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  wins, the Democratic slate is elected (except in Maine and Nebraska, which have separate processes.) Individual electors are typically public officials and party leaders chosen with input from that party's presidential campaign.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's best chance, were he to find himself in this spot, could be to try to convince Democratic electors that they should vote for a third candidate, like Senator Bernie Sanders, preventing Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  from getting to 270 electoral votes and throwing the \uc2 election\uc2  to the House of Representatives.\par \par \uc2 Alternatively, and just as theoretically, the defeated candidate could assert that the electors in a given state are unjust and ask that state's legislature to appoint a new slate of electors, Mr. Hasen said.\par \par \uc2 Appealing to Congress\par \par \uc2 The Congress recognizes and counts the votes of the Electoral College. So Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  could plead with Congress not to recognize a state's votes, or to challenge the way they were counted, Mr. Hasen said. But that would be uncharted territory for Congress.\par \par \uc2 Find out what you need to know about the 2016 presidential race today, and get politics news updates via \uc2 Facebook\uc2 , \uc2 Twitter\uc2  and the First Draft newsletter.\par \par \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2  on Friday in Johnstown, Pa. He says he reserves the right to contest results he considers questionable.

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 You can imagine Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  sitting on his golden throne in the Las Vegas hotel he built with all that cheap Chinese steel, imagine him trying to keep every molecule of reality from entering the room. He's seething, because his numbers are cratering. And yet, in his mind he cannot be losing. So, everything is rigged.\par \par \uc2 When he takes the debate stage, he does not smile. The closest thing to it is a sore-loser sneer for failing to get an Emmy out of a reality television show that allowed him to belittle women. He tries to act normal -- to hold back the hatred inside him. But this dangerous man is incapable of bottling up his dark self for a full 90 minutes. And in the end, he finally crosses the one political barrier he had yet to fully cross -- trashing democracy itself, we the people.\par \par \uc2 The best presidents are aspirational, urging us to climb every mountain and ford every stream. \uc2 Trump\uc2  has never been able to make it out of the gutter.\par \par \uc2 The remaining enablers -- Reince Priebus, \uc2 Rudy Giuliani\uc2 , \uc2 Mike Pence\uc2  -- had to know that things were bad when the Republican presidential nominee was tougher on the sainted Ronald Reagan than on the Russian strongman, \uc2 Vladimir Putin\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 And they had to know the game was over when another 3 a.m. tweet was blasted out by \uc2 Trump\uc2 , with his conclusion that he won, because of online polls that could not pass the vetting of Baghdad Bob.\par \par \uc2 The smear and loathing in Las Vegas was in character. So was \uc2 Trump\uc2 's lack of stamina. He's become a very tired and confused 70-year-old man feeding nuts to squirrels in the park of his delusions.\par \par \uc2 Thus, every \uc2 Trump\uc2  lie, every \uc2 Trump\uc2  insult, every \uc2 Trump\uc2  befuddlement over something he's utterly clueless about barely made a dent in the public's perception of him. What resonated was when he went after us, and after the most powerful tool of a self-governing nation.\par \par \uc2 To understand how \uc2 Trump\uc2  got this point you have to understand who is shaping \uc2 Trump\uc2 's worldview. The architect of the candidate's last-gasp attempt to bring the country down with him is Steve Bannon, the former head of a fabulist, far-right website -- Breitbart. Bannon is not much of a Republican.\par \par \uc2 ''I'm a Leninist,'' he said in a conversation recounted by Ronald Radosh in The Daily Beast. ''Lenin wanted to destroy the state, and that's my goal, too. I want to bring everything crashing down and destroy all of today's establishment.''\par \par \uc2 Bannon later said that he didn't recall the conversation. But he is the \uc2 Trump\uc2  whisperer, the one whose influence you can see with every minute left in the hourglass of this \uc2 election\uc2 . You have no better blueprint for \uc2 Trump\uc2 's destructive campaign than those words.\par \par \uc2 Trump\uc2  himself does not have a plan. He certainly doesn't have a governing philosophy. When asked about his Supreme Court values, the only thread of the Constitution he could talk about was the Second Amendment. But he is, in the words attributed to Bannon, doing all he can to bring everything crashing down.\par \par \uc2 So, we arrive at this American gut check. Are we the country that sends \uc2 election\uc2  monitors out to fledgling democracies, with more than two centuries of experience to impart? Are we a nation of Rockwellian citizens at polling booths overseen by church ladies? Is there any morning in \uc2 Trump\uc2 's America, or is it just the sleazy bar with a candidate desperately looking for a ''10'' at last call?\par \par \uc2 His debate-night threat, holding the validity of the \uc2 election\uc2  itself hostage, is no surprise. \uc2 Trump\uc2  is bereft of patriotism, and seems to hate the country he wants to lead. He's been talking down this nation and its most cherished institutions throughout his campaign. Time and again, he would rather defend Russia than the United States.\par \par \uc2 He's gone after free speech -- that would be the right granted in the amendment just before the only one he knows -- threatening his enemies in the press. That same first amendment ensures that a religious test will not be used to judge us -- another thing he has thrown to the side.\par \par \uc2 When most of us look in the big mirror, we see a nation of immigrants. We see families who fled a famine, who fled war, who fled nations that offered no hope to own property or have a say in choosing a leader. \uc2 Trump\uc2  sees only menace, and lowlifes with foreign accents.\par \par \uc2 He attacks the rule of law, due process, the separation of powers. He will jail his opponent, he promises. And a federal judge is disqualified because of his ethnic ancestry.\par \par \uc2 As the writer David Frum noted: ''Who among us hasn't woken up in Las Vegas feeling he made a fool of himself the night before?'' \uc2 Trump\uc2  will never know he made a fool of himself. But in the final debate, his true persona was there for all to see -- a self-hating American.\par \par \uc2 I invite you to follow me on Twitter (@nytegan).\par \par \uc2 Follow The \uc2 New York Times\uc2  Opinion section on \uc2 Facebook\uc2  and Twitter (@NYTopinion), and sign up for the Opinion Today newsletter.\par \par \uc2 Document NYTF000020161022ecam00047\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 OP-ED COLUMNIST\par \uc2 Editorial Desk; SECTA\par \b \uc2 Don't Take Donald to Dinner\b0\par\par\uc2 By GAIL COLLINS \par \uc2 893 \uc2 words\par \uc2 22 October 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 23\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 The evidence continues to mount: There is nothing in the world that \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  can't make worse.\par \par \uc2 Our latest example is the Al Smith Dinner, a feel-good annual event at New York's Waldorf Astoria hotel, in which the political and business elite gather to congratulate themselves for raising money to help poor children. It's sponsored by the Catholic archdiocese, and in presidential \uc2 election\uc2  years it's a tradition for the candidates to show up and make witty, self-deprecatory speeches in which each can also take gentle gibes at the other.\par \par \uc2 The nation is filled with must-show events for politicians. (There was quite a stir in Florida a few years ago when the gubernatorial candidates failed to attend the Wausau Possum Festival.) But few are as high-end and theoretically bipartisan as the Smith dinner. The most important guests are seated in tiers onstage, where hoi polloi can admire their table manners.\par \par \uc2 The first time I attended was back in 1980, when Ronald Reagan and \uc2 Jimmy Carter\uc2  were the star attractions. It was one of my very first assignments as a New York reporter. More prominent people covered the speeches; my job was to watch the stage and make sure the famous developer-power broker Robert Moses, who was in his 90s, made it through the meal. Moses kept sort of nodding off, his head dipping toward his soup. But my scoop never came.\par \par \uc2 There was one moment of excitement when \uc2 Jimmy Carter\uc2  tried to tell a sassy joke. He warned people to avoid getting too close to Reagan's ''I Love New York'' button because ''the paint is still wet.'' The crowd cried out, shocked that the president had gone over the good-manners line. You get the idea. This thing has been going on since 1945 without major incident, and it took \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  to screw it up.\par \par \uc2 He began with a self-pitying comment about how the New York political world had turned on him since he became a Republican. It's true that \uc2 Trump\uc2  is wildly unpopular in the city right now, although changing parties was not quite as important as the part about becoming the nastiest, most undisciplined, overall terrifying presidential nominee in American history.\par \par \uc2 Then \uc2 Trump\uc2  compared himself to Jesus (''a guy who started out as a carpenter working for his father''). But by recent standards, he was getting along pretty well. And he did note modestly that ''nobody can compete with God.''\par \par \uc2 Then things went downhill. We have seen this now so many times, people. The man can keep himself together for 10 minutes, but then he loses control. Do you think he gets bored? We know he has a severely truncated attention span. ''Hillary is so corrupt, she got kicked off the Watergate commission,'' he jibed. \uc2 Trump\uc2  broke the code about not making personal attacks, and just for good measure, he did it with a totally fictional piece of internet lore.\par \par \uc2 ''Oooh,'' muttered the crowd. \uc2 Trump\uc2  rolled on, making email jokes, \uc2 WikiLeaks\uc2  jokes and all-purpose insults. (''Hillary believes that it's vital to deceive the people ....'') The reaction moved into flat-out booing, even before he offered them up the hilarious observation that \uc2 Clinton\uc2  was there ''pretending not to hate Catholics.''\par \par \uc2 ''We're having some fun here tonight and that's good,'' \uc2 Trump\uc2  said between the groans and howls.\par \par \uc2 In a perfect world, \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  would then have gotten up and given the most good-natured speech in political history, scrapping all the barbed lines in her prepared script, like the one about how a \uc2 Trump\uc2  White House would be awkward for gatherings of the ex-presidents (''How is Barack going to get past the Muslim ban?''). But she didn't change a word, because \uc2 Clinton\uc2  is not a spontaneous politician.\par \par \uc2 If this were a normal \uc2 election\uc2 , we could have a very interesting discussion about how programmed she can be, and whether that would be a problem if she's elected. But as things stand, unless we discover she's actually an android, there's just no point.\par \par \uc2 Nobody wants to get sucked into the \uc2 Trump\uc2  vortex. For months now, he's been on a downward spiral that keeps getting wider and weirder. Everything he touches turns to crazy.\par \par \uc2 His best pal \uc2 Rudy Giuliani\uc2  used to be a credible public figure. Now, looking like a superannuated bulldog with a toothache, Giuliani prowls from one cable TV show to another, announcing that \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  was absolutely brilliant to avoid paying taxes, starting an argument about whether \uc2 Clinton\uc2  was at ground zero after 9/11 and declaring that ''everybody'' commits adultery.\par \par \uc2 Trump\uc2 's fans have graduated from paranoia about immigrants to an obsession with buses full of dead inner-city residents voting on \uc2 Election\uc2  Day.\par \par \uc2 There's nothing \uc2 Trump\uc2  can't ruin, people. We've already noted that if he became president, he'd refuse to pardon the Thanksgiving turkey. He'd decorate the White House Christmas tree with gold-plated golf balls. And I'll bet he'd bring one of those creepy clowns to the Easter Egg Roll.\par \par \uc2 I invite you to join me on \uc2 Facebook\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Follow The \uc2 New York Times\uc2  Opinion section on \uc2 Facebook\uc2  and \uc2 Twitter\uc2  (@NYTopinion), and sign up for the Opinion Today newsletter.\par \par \uc2 Document NYTF000020161022ecam0003z\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 National Desk; SECTA\par \b \uc2 Clinton\uc2  Hopes for a Mandate and Coattails\b0\par\par\uc2 By TRIP GABRIEL and ASHLEY PARKER; Trip Gabriel reported from Cleveland, and Ashley Parker from Fletcher, N.C. Amy Chozick contributed reporting from New York. \par \uc2 1,378 \uc2 words\par \uc2 22 October 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 1\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 CLEVELAND -- \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  entered the final phase of her campaign on Friday, working to ensure a victory that is decisive enough to earn a mandate for her presidency and a surge of voters to help Democrats win congressional races.\par \par \uc2 Emerging from a nine-day absence from the trail, Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  seized on the momentum of her performance in the final presidential debate, choosing Ohio -- a battleground state where she has struggled the most against \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2  -- as her first stop on a four-day swing. With new polls showing Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  closing in on Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  in the state, her campaign is glimpsing the opportunity for a clean sweep of traditional swing states.\par \par \uc2 Reminding voters of Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's refusal in Wednesday's debate to say definitively he would accept the outcome on \uc2 Election\uc2  Day, Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  said that as secretary of state she had visited countries whose leaders jailed political opponents and invalidated elections they did not win. ''We know in our country the difference between leadership and dictatorship,'' she said.\par \par \uc2 She also portrayed herself as a the candidate who could attract independent, undecided and even Republican voters unhappy with Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's campaign. ''I want to say something to people who may be reconsidering their support of my opponent,'' she said. ''I know you still may have questions for me, I respect that. I want to answer them. I want to earn your vote.''\par \par \uc2 Her stop here marked the start of a rare multiday tour of swing states as the \uc2 Clinton\uc2  campaign revved up its efforts to decisively defeat Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  on Nov. 8, including releasing a powerful minute-long ad featuring Khizr Khan, the father of a Muslim American soldier killed in Iraq. The ad featuring Mr. Khan, who was attacked by Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  after he spoke at the Democratic convention, will run in Ohio, Florida, Pennsylvania and North Carolina, as well as other crucial states.\par \par \uc2 With Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  holding a healthy lead in most national polls, Democrats have turned their focus to trying to ensure victory by as large a margin as possible, deploying \uc2 Michelle Obama\uc2  in Arizona and President Obama in Florida. The larger the victory, the less Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  and his supporters can claim foul play, Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's allies said.\par \par \uc2 A month ago, Ohio seemed to be aligning as a \uc2 Trump\uc2  stronghold, as its large bloc of white working-class voters responded to Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's economic populism and America-first message. But the state is now back in play, with a poll from Suffolk University in Boston showing a tied race.\par \par \uc2 Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's afternoon rally at a community college in Cleveland, the heart of Democratic strength in Ohio, was aimed at increasing early voting, which began last week.\par \par \uc2 While early voting has traditionally been a Democratic strength in Ohio, the data shows potential complications for Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  on this front. Requests for early ballots are down 22.3 percent in Cuyahoga County, where Cleveland is, compared with the same period in 2012. Requests are also off 12.7 percent in Franklin County, which includes Columbus, the capital, according to data compiled by Michael McDonald, a University of Florida professor who studies voter turnout.\par \par \uc2 A decided advantage for Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  here is the strength of Democrats' grass-roots efforts. The party has leased 93 offices statewide, according to Chris Wyant, the \uc2 Clinton\uc2  campaign director in Ohio.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's Ohio director cut ties recently with the state's Republican chairman, Matt Borges, over Mr. Borges's sharply worded public doubts about Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 . ''They have an internal civil war on the Republican side,'' Brian Fallon, Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's press secretary, told reporters here.\par \par \uc2 He added that two weeks ago, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  was slightly ahead in the state. ''But Ohio is really a symbol of the progress we've made in the past two weeks since the first debate,'' he said.\par \par \uc2 Ohio is not essential to Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's road to the White House. She could lose it and still romp through the Electoral College given her dominance in other swing states like Virginia, Pennsylvania and Colorado, according to polls.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  spent the day hopscotching to rallies in North Carolina and Pennsylvania, a state where Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  has built a formidable lead. While he projected a subdued confidence at a rally in Fletcher, N.C., he also seemed to prepare for at least the possibility of an \uc2 Election\uc2  Day loss.\par \par \uc2 ''I don't know what kind of shape I'm in, but I'll be happy, and at least I will have known, win, lose or draw -- and I'm almost sure, if the people come out, we're going to win -- I will be happy with myself,'' he said.\par \par \uc2 At his rally in Fletcher, he offered a slightly more restrained version of his typically freewheeling speech, largely hewing to his prepared remarks.\par \par \uc2 Gone were his complaints of a ''rigged'' and ''stolen'' \uc2 election\uc2  -- they have drawn condemnation by Democrats and Republicans alike -- and he did not, as he has recently, try to counter accusations from the 10 women who have come forward to accuse him of inappropriate sexual advances.\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 Trump\uc2  campaign has said that it plans to increase Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's schedule in the final weeks, potentially holding as many as six rallies a day. Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  explained that he wanted to have no regrets, should he lose.\par \par \uc2 ''I don't want to think back, 'If only I did one more rally, I would have won North Carolina by 500 votes instead of losing it by 200 votes.'''\par \par \uc2 Later, again seeming to acknowledge that he might not win the White House, he grumbled, ''What a waste of time if we don't pull this off.''\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's team increasingly views North Carolina as a state that is critical to a victory in November, along with others like Florida, Ohio and Pennsylvania. Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's running mate, \uc2 Gov. Mike Pence\uc2  of Indiana, visited the same town just last week.\par \par \uc2 At a rally later on Friday in Johnstown, Pa., Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  took the stage with a renewed vigor -- ''I just got caught in the rain,'' he bellowed, ''how does my hair look?'' -- and he returned to his theme of a ''rigged system.''\par \par \uc2 Speaking to a crowd in the mill town, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  cast himself as the champion of Pennsylvania's working class. ''The iron and steels forged in your mills formed the backbone of our nation,'' he said, promising to bring prosperity back to the region. ''You were the leading steel producer in the United States -- did you know that?''\par \par \uc2 In Cleveland, Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  accused Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  of buying Chinese-made steel for his high-rise buildings. ''I'm going to let Donald try to explain himself to the steelworker filing for unemployment,'' she said.\par \par \uc2 Seemingly energized by the more raucous Pennsylvania crowd, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  ended his rally with a call to victory. ''We will win,'' he said. ''We will shock the world.''\par \par \uc2 Then, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , who, on the eve of a campaign trip to Scotland, admitted he did not really understand the nuances of the ''Brexit'' vote, ended with an ebullient rallying cry by predicting an upset victory. His win in November, he said, would be ''Brexit-plus.''\par \par \uc2 But a full day of events seemed to drain some of the energy from Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , whose mood often rises on the strength of his crowds. At his final rally of the day, in Newtown, Pa., the Republican nominee began well ahead of schedule, spoke for just 30 minutes and wrapped up his speech at 7:31 p.m. -- exactly one minute after he was originally slated to take the stage.\par \par \uc2 Find out what you need to know about the 2016 presidential race today, and get politics news updates via \uc2 Facebook\uc2 , \uc2 Twitter\uc2  and the First Draft newsletter.\par \par \uc2 This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.\par \par \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  at a rally at Cuyahoga Community College in Cleveland on Friday.

UPDEGROVE \par \uc2 953 \uc2 words\par \uc2 22 October 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 23\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Austin, Tex. -- Richard M. Nixon, the first president to resign from office, was hardly a beacon of moral integrity. Nor was Nixon above demagogy on the campaign trail, infamously fanning the flames of Communist paranoia during the McCarthy era by unjustly painting his opponent in his 1950 Senate race, the California congresswoman Helen Gahagan Douglas, as the ''Pink Lady.''\par \par \uc2 But the 37th president, as controversial as he was, offers a good example for \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2  on the importance of putting the country ahead of one's ego and personal ambition on \uc2 Election\uc2  Day.\par \par \uc2 When Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , amid his claims that the voting process is rigged, was asked in Wednesday's debate if he would accept a losing result in the coming \uc2 election\uc2 , he responded by spitting in the face of American democracy. ''I will tell you at the time. I'll keep you in suspense,'' he said glibly, as though presaging a reality-show cliffhanger. The next day he told an audience in Ohio that he would accept the results of the \uc2 election\uc2  -- ''if I win.''\par \par \uc2 He would do well to look at the \uc2 election\uc2  of 1960, which pitted Nixon, the Republican presidential nominee and sitting vice president, against his Democratic rival, the Massachusetts senator John F. Kennedy. The two candidates waged admirable campaigns, which included squaring off in four substantive, widely watched debates, culminating with the \uc2 election\uc2  on Nov. 8.\par \par \uc2 The outcome was a wafer-thin victory for Kennedy, who garnered 49.7 percent of the vote and 303 electoral votes, versus 49.5 percent and 219 votes for Nixon. Of the 68 million votes cast, only 119,000 swung the \uc2 election\uc2  for Kennedy, who had taken Illinois and Minnesota by the slimmest of margins.\par \par \uc2 But shortly after Nixon's concession to Kennedy, which he offered in a gracious telegram to his opponent early on the morning of Nov. 9, reports of voting fraud in Illinois and Texas benefiting the Democratic ticket began to surface. In Chicago, in one instance, 121 votes were counted after only 43 people voted, and 6,138 ballots were cast in a Texas county with just 4,895 registered voters.\par \par \uc2 The Republican establishment challenged the results in the news media and in state-level demands for a recount. President Dwight D. Eisenhower even offered to help Nixon raise money to cover what could easily have been a monthslong fight. Over the following weeks the Republicans relentlessly pursued charges of voting irregularity in Illinois and 10 other states, betting that if they won there, they could force a nationwide recount.\par \par \uc2 But in contrast to Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's rhetoric today, they tended to cast their efforts in patriotic terms; Eisenhower insisted that he merely wanted to show that the federal government ''did not shirk its duty'' when it came to questions about the electoral process. Unlike Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , they started from a position of trust in the system, focusing their charges of specific malfeasance, rather than declaiming the \uc2 election\uc2  itself as ''rigged.''\par \par \uc2 Nevertheless, Nixon, while agonized by his defeat and its dubious circumstances, opted not to join in.\par \par \uc2 At least publicly, he played the statesman; he subordinated his own ambitions for the sake of governmental continuity, ensuring that the country was not thrown off balance at a time when the United States was enmeshed in a Cold War with the Soviet Union. ''I could think of no worse example for nations abroad,'' he said, ''than that of the United States wrangling over the results of our presidential elections, and even suggesting that the presidency itself could be stolen by thievery at the ballot box.'' (And, of course, he hoped to have a long political career ahead of him; being seen as a sore loser wouldn't further it.)\par \par \uc2 Whether Nixon privately encouraged the recount efforts is almost beside the point; unlike Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , he understood that unless rock-solid evidence existed to the contrary, the country needed to have faith in the electoral process and the peaceful transition of power, and it needed to hear from the losing candidate that he did, too. (Some argue, however, that Nixon's experience in 1960 drove his paranoid turn as president, leading directly to Watergate.)\par \par \uc2 The good of the country, Nixon averred, was more important than the fate of any one man. When Kennedy took office on a bitterly cold January day two and a half months after the \uc2 election\uc2 , he sounded a similar theme: ''Ask not what your country can do for you. Ask what you can do for your country.''\par \par \uc2 In a bizarre twist, Nixon was an early supporter of \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2 . After hearing rave reviews about the brash developer from Nixon's wife, Pat, who had seen him on ''The Phil Donahue Show'' in December 1987, he wrote Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  an unsolicited letter. ''I did not see the program,'' he wrote, ''but Mrs. Nixon said you were great.'' He added, ''As you can imagine, she is an expert on politics, and she predicts that whenever you decide to run for office you will be a winner!'' One wonders what Nixon, a political sage, would think of Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  the ''winner'' today.\par \par \uc2 But there's little doubt that if Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  winds up the loser on Nov. 8, Nixon, despite outsize flaws in his own character, would advocate putting country above self. Doing anything less would take some of the greatness out of America.\par \par \uc2 Follow The \uc2 New York Times\uc2  Opinion section on \uc2 Facebook\uc2  and \uc2 Twitter\uc2  (@NYTopinion), and sign up for the Opinion Today newsletter.\par \par \uc2 Mark K.

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 To the Editor:\par \par \uc2 Re ''\uc2 Trump\uc2  Stays Firm on Having Option to Dispute Vote'' (front page, Oct. 21):\par \par \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  might not accept the results of the presidential \uc2 election\uc2 ? O.K., I think that means that after Nov. 8 there will be no end to the angry blaming, bleating, threatening, denigrating attacks appearing in the leading stories of any and all media sources. When -- oh when -- will this ever stop? I'm desperate for silence.\par \par \uc2 A month of silence would allow us to hear ourselves thinking; we could shed the dread and just get back to enjoying our lives. It might enable the collective national wounds to begin healing.\par \par \uc2 Admittedly, I sense that this wish is unlikely to be fulfilled. But I must ask The Times, could you lead the way to inner peace by declaring a monthlong moratorium on any stories containing the word ''\uc2 Trump\uc2 '' or ''Donald''? Could you starve the beast for just 30 days? Could you instead feed me, your subscriber, by giving me a break?\par \par \uc2 Please?\par \par \uc2 SUSAN H. TAFT\par \par \uc2 Pike, Ohio\par \par \uc2 To the Editor:\par \par \uc2 The campaign is drawing to a close, and I wish that The Times's coverage had been more objective. There was often little difference between news and editorial content, and a strong anti-Republican slant.\par \par \uc2 Look at your news analysis on the final debate (''Interrupting, Mocking and Taunting, \uc2 Clinton\uc2  Turns the Tormentor,'' front page, Oct. 20). \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  is praised for outmaneuvering Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  by adopting some of the abrasive behaviors he has shown, while the calmer Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  is mocked as ''defanged.''\par \par \uc2 I will hide under my bed if Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  wins, but The Times's dislike of him permeates news articles and throws the paper's ability to provide truthful reporting into doubt. Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  is an extreme example, but coverage of other Republicans has followed suit. Meanwhile, the paper has tap-danced around Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's email issue.\par \par \uc2 Reporting needs to be accurate, even when showing shortcomings of a public figure. But an obvious slant toward one party doesn't help readers, who must rely on objective reporting to make good decisions.\par \par \uc2 ANGELA CAMACK\par \par \uc2 Jackson, N.J.\par \par \uc2 To the Editor:\par \par \uc2 In ''Criticism of Press Takes On Sinister Tone'' (Mediator column, Oct. 17), Jim Rutenberg urges ''a far more assertive defense from the news media, of what it does well and honestly.'' Mr. Rutenberg is right: The public's distrust of the news media is an existential threat to our country and the media itself.\par \par \uc2 The campaign to discredit journalists has been going on for decades. Spiro Agnew famously attacked TV commentators in November 1969, after their ''instant analysis'' disparaged an address by President Richard M. Nixon.\par \par \uc2 Blaming the media has become the standard defense of politicians, celebrities, public officials and corporations who would rather loot the public and write the laws for their own benefit without pesky journalists bent on public disclosure.\par \par \uc2 As a journalist myself, I can delineate the media's biases and shortcomings better than most. But I also know that without a robust media fundamentally trusted by the public, our democracy is in dire peril.\par \par \uc2 FRANCES CERRA WHITTELSEY\par \par \uc2 Huntington, N.Y.\par \par \uc2 The writer is a former reporter for The New York Times.\par \par \uc2 Document NYTF000020161022ecam00033\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw272\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4080\pichgoal600

\par\par \b \uc2 Trump\uc2 's Posts Fuel Discord in Facebook Ranks --- Debate over whether content should be removed as hate speech reached CEO\b0\par\par\uc2 By Deepa Seetharaman   \par \uc2 963 \uc2 words\par \uc2 22 October 2016\par \uc2 The Wall Street Journal\par \uc2 J\par A1\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 Some of Republican presidential candidate \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2 's posts on \uc2 Facebook\uc2  have set off an intense debate inside the social media company over the past year, with some employees arguing certain posts about banning Muslims from entering the U.S. should be removed for violating the site's rules on hate speech, according to people familiar with the matter.\par \par \uc2 The decision to allow Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's posts went all the way to Facebook Inc. Chief Executive \uc2 Mark Zuckerberg\uc2 , who ruled in December that it would be inappropriate to censor the candidate, according to the people familiar with the matter. That decision has prompted employees to complain on \uc2 Facebook\uc2 's internal messaging service and in person to Mr. Zuckerberg and other managers that it was bending the site's rules, and some employees who work in a group charged with reviewing content threatened to quit, the people said.\par \par \uc2 "\uc2 Facebook\uc2  has never contacted us about employee complaints and has never removed a post," a spokeswoman for Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's campaign said. "We are not concerned about the liberal \uc2 Clinton\uc2  elites who are so intolerant of conservative ideas that they would seek to censor the \uc2 Trump\uc2  campaign's enormously successful \uc2 Facebook\uc2  engagement."\par \par \uc2 In a statement provided Wednesday evening, a Facebook spokeswoman said its reviewers consider the context of a post when assessing whether to take it down. "That context can include the value of political discourse," she said. "Many people are voicing opinions about this particular content and it has become an important part of the conversation around who the next U.S. president will be."\par \par \uc2 On Friday, senior members of \uc2 Facebook\uc2 's policy team posted more details on its policy. "In the weeks ahead, we're going to begin allowing more items that people find newsworthy, significant, or important to the public interest -- even if they might otherwise violate our standards," they wrote.\par \par \uc2 The internal debates shed light on how \uc2 Facebook\uc2  has grappled with its position as one of the biggest sources of political information during a particularly contentious \uc2 election\uc2  cycle.\par \par \uc2 This past week, a controversy bubbled up around Facebook director \uc2 Peter Thiel\uc2 , who recently pledged $1.25 million to support Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 . In an internal post to employees confirmed by the company, Mr. Zuckerberg urged tolerance of Mr. Thiel's political activity, saying it was key to cultivating diversity. \uc2 Facebook\uc2  declined to comment further, and Mr. Thiel didn't respond to a request for comment.\par \par \uc2 Facebook\uc2  -- which stands to collect an estimated $300 million from online political advertising this year, according to Nomura analysts -- has strived to appear nonpartisan and neutral, amid complaints that the company and key executives favor Democrats. A May report from tech blog Gizmodo alleged \uc2 Facebook\uc2  contract workers suppressed news of interest to conservative readers on the site's influential trending topics feature. \uc2 Facebook\uc2  denied bias, but in August, it fired the contractors so that it could run the feature largely by software.\par \par \uc2 "They are confronting in a very real way for the first time the political dimensions of their platform," said Anna Lauren Hoffmann, who teaches information ethics at the \uc2 University of California, Berkeley\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 About 44% of Americans get at least some of their news from \uc2 Facebook\uc2 , according to Pew Research.\par \par \uc2 While the company says it is a neutral platform for open debate, it has strict rules around what users can post. The rules, which \uc2 Facebook\uc2  has tightened in recent years, ban discrimination toward people based on their race and religion. \uc2 Facebook\uc2  typically removes content that violates the rules.\par \par \uc2 Issues around Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's posts emerged when he posted on \uc2 Facebook\uc2  a link to a Dec. 7 campaign statement "on preventing Muslim immigration." The statement called for "a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States until our country's representatives can figure out what is going on." Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  has since backed away from an outright ban based on religion, saying his policies would target immigrants from countries with a record of terrorism.\par \par \uc2 Users flagged the December content as hate speech, a move that triggered a review by \uc2 Facebook\uc2 's community-operations team, with hundreds of employees in several offices. Some \uc2 Facebook\uc2  employees said in internal chat rooms that the post broke \uc2 Facebook\uc2 's rules on hate speech as detailed in internal guidelines, according to people familiar with the matter.\par \par \uc2 Content reviewers were asked by their managers not to remove the post, according to some of the people familiar. \uc2 Facebook\uc2 's head of global policy management, Monika Bickert, later explained in an internal post that the company wouldn't take down any of Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's posts because it strives to be impartial in the \uc2 election\uc2  season, according to people who saw the post.\par \par \uc2 During one of Mr. Zuckerberg's weekly town-hall meetings in late January at the company's Menlo Park, Calif., headquarters, a Muslim employee asked how the executive could condone Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's comments. Mr. Zuckerberg acknowledged Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's call for a ban did qualify as hate speech, but he said the implications of removing the posts were too drastic, according to two people who attended the meeting. Mr. Zuckerberg said he backed Ms. Bickert's call, they said.\par \par \uc2 Many employees supported the decision. "Banning a U.S. presidential candidate is not something you do lightly," said one person familiar with the decision.\par \par \uc2 But others, including some Muslim employees, were upset that the platform would make an exception. In Dublin, where many of \uc2 Facebook\uc2 's content reviewers work, more than a dozen Muslim employees met with their managers to discuss the policy, according to another person familiar with the matter.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=wjco20161022000125"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document J000000020161022ecam0003a\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw272\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4080\pichgoal600

The \uc2 FBI\uc2  closed the case without recommending any charges.\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 FBI\uc2  forensically recovered about 15,000 deleted email messages from Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's personal server as part of its investigation. Of those, 9,400 were deemed personal while another 5,600 were deemed work-related and will be released to the public.\par \par \uc2 -- Byron Tau\par \par \uc2 ---\par \par \uc2 RALLY\par \par \uc2 Trump\uc2  Criticizes\par \par \uc2 Michelle Obama\par \par \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  took a rare swipe at first lady \uc2 Michelle Obama\uc2  Friday, reminding voters of a comment she had made about \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  eight years ago that he called "vicious."\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , speaking at a rally in North Carolina, criticized Mrs. Obama's frequent campaigning for the Democratic nominee, and quoted a crack she had made during the 2008 Democratic presidential primary contest.\par \par \uc2 "I see how much [\uc2 Michelle Obama\uc2 ] likes Hillary, but wasn't she the one that originally started the statement, 'If you can't take care of your home, you can't take care of the White House or the country,'" he said, quoting a line that at the time was seen as an allusion to the rocky patches of the \uc2 Clinton\uc2  marriage.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  suggested he had considered using the line in his own speeches but decided against it.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  has refrained from attacking the first lady, and turning his fire on her now carries political risks. Polls show that she is one of the most popular public figures in America. The latest Wall Street Journal/NBC New poll showed 59% of Americans viewed her positively, compared with 40% for Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  and 29% for Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 -- Janet Hook\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=wjco20161022000122"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document J000000020161022ecam00037\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw272\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4080\pichgoal600

\par\par \b \uc2 Election\uc2  2016: Spending Increases as Race Winds Down\b0\par\par\uc2 By Rebecca Ballhaus   \par \uc2 571 \uc2 words\par \uc2 22 October 2016\par \uc2 The Wall Street Journal\par \uc2 J\par A4\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 WASHINGTON -- \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  and \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  escalated their spending last month, particularly on television advertising, as they prepared for the final offensive of the 2016 presidential campaign.\par \par \uc2 The parallels ended there.\par \par \uc2 Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , the Democratic nominee, spent $82 million in September, about $9 million more than she raised and $33 million more than she spent the previous month, according to a report her campaign filed with the \uc2 Federal \uc2 Election\uc2  Commission\uc2  late Thursday.\par \par \uc2 The primary driver of her increased spending: a $66 million investment in TV advertising, up from $32.6 million in August. Her second-largest expenditure was on payroll, which cost her campaign $3.4 million -- up from about $3.2 million in August.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's spending last month took a more dramatic shift. He spent $70 million, more than double the $30 million he had spent the previous month and $25 million more than he raised in September. He, too, grew his investment in TV advertising, spending $23.2 million -- up from $5.2 million in August.\par \par \uc2 Yet unlike Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  didn't devote a particularly large share of his resources to his staff. His spending on payroll grew by just $200,000 last month, while his spending on field consulting shrank by about $100,000. Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  paid about 220 staffers last month, his filing showed, compared with 815 paid by Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 . In total, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  spent $1.7 million on staff last month. His investment in hats and other campaign merchandise was far larger: $3.7 million.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's outsize spending last month left his coffers $25 million short of Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's. He had $34.7 million in the bank at the end of September, to Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's $59 million. Including funds raised by their joint party accounts, Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  ended September with twice as much in the bank as Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  -- $150 million to his $75 million.\par \par \uc2 Among the firms that drew the largest checks from the \uc2 Trump\uc2  campaign was Giles-Parscale, a San Antonio-based web-marketing company run by Brad Parscale, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's digital director. The firm earned $20.6 million from the campaign in September -- up from $11.1 million in August. The payments were categorized as for "digital consulting/online advertising."\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  also escalated his payments to a data-analytics firm called Cambridge Analytica, which is partly owned by hedge-fund executive \uc2 Robert Mercer\uc2 , one of the nominee's top donors, who has expanded his influence in the campaign in recent months. Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  paid the firm $5 million in September, up from $250,000 in August.\par \par \uc2 While Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  has overall reduced spending on his own companies in recent months, he more than doubled his payments last month to Tag Air, an airline he owns. The campaign paid the airline $757,000 in September, up from $319,000 the previous month. Overall, it paid close to $990,000 to \uc2 Trump\uc2 -owned firms last month.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's legal expenses also more than doubled last month, when he paid nearly $500,000 to seven law firms. In August, he paid $232,000 to four firms. In contrast, Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's spending on legal consulting last month dropped, totaling $118,000 to two firms -- nearly a fourth of what she spent on lawyers in August.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=wjco20161022000121"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document J000000020161022ecam00036\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw272\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4080\pichgoal600

\par\par \b \uc2 Election\uc2  2016: With Debates Over, \uc2 Clinton\uc2  Is Back Out on the Trail\b0\par\par\uc2 By Peter Nicholas   \par \uc2 602 \uc2 words\par \uc2 22 October 2016\par \uc2 The Wall Street Journal\par \uc2 J\par A5\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 CLEVELAND -- Over the past week, voters attending rallies in battleground states have seen the marquee players in Democratic politics campaigning for \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 : President \uc2 Barack Obama\uc2 , first lady \uc2 Michelle Obama\uc2 , former President \uc2 Bill \uc2 Clinton\uc2  and Vice President \uc2 Joe Biden\uc2 , among them.\par \par \uc2 Who they haven't seen is Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 . But that's about to change.\par \par \uc2 The Democratic nominee, after days holed up in hotel rooms preparing for this past week's final presidential debate, returned to the trail Friday with a rally in Cleveland. A campaign blitz in the next few days will take her to Pennsylvania, North Carolina and New Hampshire, where she will make a joint appearance with Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts.\par \par \uc2 By her own admission, Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  hasn't kept up an especially brisk campaign pace heading into the final sprint to \uc2 Election\uc2  Day. Her last campaign rallies were on Oct. 12 in Colorado and Nevada. After returning to her home in Chappaqua, N.Y., early Thursday morning following the debate in Las Vegas, she took part in the Alfred E. Smith gala in New York that evening, where she and Republican rival \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  swapped jabs.\par \par \uc2 At the lectern, she quipped: "This is such a special event that I took a break from my rigorous nap schedule to be here."\par \par \uc2 Prepping for the debates, her aides said, was time well spent. Since the first debate on Sept. 26, Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  has expanded her lead over Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  from about 2 percentage points to more than 6 points, according to a Real Clear Politics average of national polls. It's a leap her staff attributes in part to debate performances.\par \par \uc2 "It's also great to be able to campaign, but to prepare this way and be ready to take full advantage of that [debate] stage and make her case to voters is worthwhile," \uc2 Clinton\uc2  spokeswoman Jennifer Palmieri told reporters.\par \par \uc2 The final face-off drew 71.6 million television viewers, according to Nielsen.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  has prioritized rallies. In an interview Friday, he cited the large crowds and the news coverage of the events to justify his approach.\par \par \uc2 "We're doing sometimes five stops a day. We have a very rigorous campaign."\par \par \uc2 At times Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  has questioned his rival's stamina and whether she is up to the demands of the presidency. Asked about that contention, he said: "I hope that she is perfectly healthy. I can't speak to her health. I can only speak to the fact that few people have ever seen a campaign that is like mine."\par \par \uc2 Steve McMahon, a Democratic strategist, said the continuous TV coverage of Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  is now working to Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's advantage. "It helps when \uc2 Trump\uc2  is out there doing his thing," he said. "Why compete with it?"\par \par \uc2 The race has grown increasingly bitter, as evidenced by the barbed speeches at the Smith dinner, an event normally leavened by self-deprecating humor. Still, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  and Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  shook hands at the end, a gesture the two avoided during the last debate.\par \par \uc2 As the race has wound down, Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  has tested the proposition that blanketing the campaign trail is a candidate's best strategy. She has the benefit of a large roster of popular Democrats happy to campaign on her behalf.\par \par \uc2 Still, some party activists privately say having the nominee headline an event helps energize grass-roots supporters, who can then be deployed to voter-turnout programs.\par \par \uc2 ---\par \par \uc2 Carol E.

\par\par \b \uc2 Inside Paul Ryan's House Rescue Mission\b0\par\par\uc2 By Joseph Rago   \par \uc2 2,091 \uc2 words\par \uc2 22 October 2016\par \uc2 The Wall Street Journal\par \uc2 J\par A9\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 Miami -- Someone has neglected to remove the most recent tear-sheet from an \uc2 election\uc2  calendar on the wall of Congressman Carlos Curbelo's campaign office in a nondescript Florida strip mall. This seems to indicate that there is one more day left until Nov. 8 than there really is, which is one day too many. Then again, time is on everyone's mind in the middle of \uc2 Paul Ryan\uc2 's rolling-thunder tour, as the House speaker travels to save Republican majorities.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Ryan will visit 45 cities in 17 states and do more than 100 events, and Florida's 26th Congressional District was a destination this week. FL-26, which stretches from southwest Miami-Dade County to the Keys, is among the most contested in the nation and will help determine the balance of power in Washington next year. The GOP holds 246 seats of the 435-member House, Democrats 186, with three vacancies, which means Republicans can afford to lose no more than 29 to retain control.\par \par \uc2 For a meet-and-greet at his phone bank, Mr. Curbelo introduces "Mr. Speaker, Paul" to the mostly college-age volunteers. There are selfies. "Believe it or not, we have ideas. We have solutions," Mr. Ryan says, fishing a pocket copy of the GOP's "Better Way" campaign agenda from his suit jacket. "I always tell people, if you're just getting started in politics, forget about what you see on \uc2 Twitter\uc2  and TV, and think about the ideas in this campaign."\par \par \uc2 Ideas haven't mattered in the joyless twilight struggle between \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  and \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , not that Mr. Ryan hasn't tried to change the subject. One imagines his omnipresent copies of the "Better Way" brochure -- detailed reforms for the economy and national security -- spilling out of glove compartments and kitchen cabinets.\par \par \uc2 He agreed to serve as speaker -- fewer than 365 days ago -- only on the condition that "we will be a proposition party, offering an agenda," he said in an interview this week. He prefers to talk substance: "I think at the end of the day that's the kind of campaign we should run from a moral standpoint but also from a strategic standpoint."\par \par \uc2 The "Better Way" was developed by consensus within the GOP conference, which is the largest since 1928. Yet the possibility that the House could flip has gone from unrealistic a year ago to increasingly possible.\par \par \uc2 The nonpartisan Cook Political Report rates 57 House races as competitive. For most of the year House races had been relatively stable, but this month polling from Oregon Rep. Greg Walden's National Republican Congressional Committee discovered an ominous downward trend after videotape emerged of Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's colloquy with Billy Bush.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Ryan concedes that political analysts can "concoct a realistic scenario where our majority could be in jeopardy." He says he feels "pretty confident that we're going to keep it, but it's going to be a bigger fight just given the headwinds we have, more or less" and "my level of urgency is never take anything for granted."\par \par \uc2 Mr. Curbelo is a portrait of the stakes. The son of Cuban exiles and a former Miami school-board member, the freshman has carved out an independent profile and concentrated on education and antipoverty. As he toured elementary schools with Mr. Ryan this week, he showcased the Every Student Succeeds Act, which gave students learning English more time to become proficient in reading. (FL-26 is majority-Hispanic.) He also repeatedly cited -- in English and Spanish -- provisions he wrote in "Better Way" about juvenile criminal-justice reform.\par \par \uc2 On Tuesday Mr. Ryan visited Will Hurd, another freshman, in Texas' 23rd district, which reaches from San Antonio to El Paso and includes 800 miles of Mexican border. On Friday he toured Green Bay with Mike Gallagher, a smart and impressive Marine vet who is running to replace retiring Republican Rep. Reid Ribble in Wisconsin's 8th district.\par \par \uc2 These are the swing districts that make a House majority -- usually suburban, decided each \uc2 election\uc2  by a couple of percentage points, with voters who tend to be moderate, middle-class, younger than average and college-educated. These districts also tend to produce Congress's most creative and productive politicians. Think of Mike Coffman, from the Denver suburbs, or Barbara Comstock of Virginia's Washington exurbs, Bob Dold of northern Chicagoland, or Utah's Mia Love, the first black Republican woman sent to Congress. They show what the GOP, despite the \uc2 Trump\uc2  interregnum, could be -- optimistic, forward-looking, inclusive.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Ryan says the "Better Way" was designed to be "majoritarian, an agenda that can win in the suburbs of Miami and Denver and Midland, Texas. Something that can succeed and capture the hearts and minds of discerning voters in red, purple and blue areas, so that we can win a national \uc2 election\uc2 , win the Electoral College, keep Congress, put it into law. That is the only way in my opinion under this constitutional republic you can save this country."\par \par \uc2 This conviction helps explain Mr. Ryan's ambiguity about Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , who is already constructing a stabbed-in-the-back narrative that blames the speaker for his likely loss. Mr. Ryan believes the government and economic status quo isn't merely inherited from the past but borrowed from the future, which American leaders have an obligation to change.\par \par \uc2 "We have a window, no one knows how long it is, but it's not long, to fix this trajectory that we're on, on our own terms as a country," he explains, adding that "we're in a vicious cycle: bad economy, bad debt, bad foreign policy, bad politics, so people feel much more insecure, economically and from a security standpoint.\par \par \uc2 "It doesn't take much in my opinion, but for some big things to happen, a handful of big reforms, and we can turn ourselves into a virtuous cycle. America can regenerate very quickly," he continues.\par \par \uc2 "Do I wish we were having a debate about these ideas right now instead of the latest \uc2 Twitter\uc2  storm or \uc2 WikiLeaks\uc2  or, you know, personality contest?" Mr. Ryan says. "Yeah, of course I do. But it is what it is."\par \par \uc2 Even amid Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's intrusions, Mr. Ryan says that "our nominee is fine with this agenda. He doesn't run on the agenda. He doesn't talk about it. But we know we don't have a problem or an obstacle with our nominee with this agenda. Would it have been ideal -- "\par \par \uc2 Was that because the "Better Way" skips trade and immigration?\par \par \uc2 "Well, that was something that was divisive in our own party," Mr. Ryan replies. "We need to run on an agenda that unifies us as Republicans and as conservatives, and what are the big issues that must be tackled? The economy, growth, poverty, debt, deficits, self-government, the Constitution, national security -- that's pretty big right there."\par \par \uc2 The other political problem for Mr. Ryan is that maybe a third of GOP House districts are pro-\uc2 Trump\uc2 , a third anti-\uc2 Trump\uc2  and a third somewhere in between. He has been in a vise since Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  won the nomination. If the nominee keeps sinking, he could take down the House and Senate majorities in the undertow.\par \par \uc2 Democrats are up a couple points in the so-called generic ballot, where pollsters ask voters which party they prefer to control Congress. But over the fall the Republican image has improved slightly even as Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's has plummeted. Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  isn't popular either, and the Democratic advantage hasn't reached (not yet at least) the double-digits that precede a wave \uc2 election\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 This week Democrats launched a huge battleground advertising blitz hoping to tie vulnerable Republicans to Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's medicine ball. The polls generally show that voters decouple Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  from the Republican Party -- so far.\par \par \uc2 This late message may not break through because until now Democrats have depicted Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  as far worse than a normal Republican, and the competitive House media markets are expensive. Good examples are New Hampshire's 1st District, which covers Manchester and the seacoast region north of Boston, or Minnesota's 2nd District, the suburbs west of the Twin Cities. Mr. Ryan has raised nearly $50 million for GOP candidates.\par \par \uc2 One less noticed edge is that individual Republicans are in sync politically with their districts. Democrats didn't follow the \uc2 Rahm Emanuel\uc2  strategy of 2006, when they recruited top-tier centrists to build a majority. Most of them got wiped out in 2010 with a 63-seat loss, and this year's slate is more in keeping with the leftward march of President Obama's progressive party. Mr. Curbelo's opponent, former congressman Joe Garcia, refers to the GOP as "the \uc2 Taliban\uc2 ."\par \par \uc2 Surveys suggest that most Americans can't wait for the \uc2 election\uc2  to be over. But this anticipation discounts the potential for U.S. politics to get worse, not better.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Ryan tried to work out a corporate-tax-reform-for-infrastructure trade with \uc2 Sen. Chuck Schumer\uc2 , which he says failed because the Democratic Party is now "run by Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren. This is not a party run by \uc2 Alice Rivlin\uc2  and \uc2 Erskine Bowles\uc2 . There aren't 1990s Democrats in this party anymore." He isn't optimistic about an emergence of a pragmatic Hillary that some like to imagine.\par \par \uc2 Meanwhile, the GOP Stations of the Cross will probably continue. Mr. Ryan's critics, on the left and right, often attribute the \uc2 Trump\uc2  phenomenon to the speaker's agenda and priorities and their supposed lack of popular appeal: Voters aren't thrilled by tax reform and won't attend a rally about every student succeeding.\par \par \uc2 Republicans need to "offer" more, this critique goes, whether that implies benefits like child subsidies or \uc2 Trump\uc2 -style populism. There is some evidence in support: The presidential candidates who ran in explicit opposition to the Republican Party -- Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  and Ted Cruz -- captured 44.9% and 25.1% of the GOP primary vote, respectively.\par \par \uc2 "The critics basically say to be populist and give vague platitudes. What does that achieve? We need to be smart in how we talk about our ideas, but if we believe in what we believe in we should be clear and honest," Mr. Ryan responds. "If you think you know the right way to fix a problem, then go identify that solution and go talk about it and campaign on it. Do I believe everybody is going to read every little detail of this" -- removing another copy of the "Better Way" from his coat pocket -- "or do I believe that people are going to be focused on the micro-policy or principles of this?\par \par \uc2 "No. But what matters is they know we actually have a solution, what that solution looks like, so that we can earn the right to put that solution in place. To me it's all about winning the moral authority to put it in place after the \uc2 election\uc2 ," Mr. Ryan continues. "To me, critics who say it's too dense, or it's not populist enough, are missing the point."\par \par \uc2 Meanwhile, if Congress's Carlos Curbelos and Mia Loves get washed out but the GOP retains the House, the lower chamber could become even more of a horror show, as a smaller majority would intensify the GOP's factional politics. "We need to have a healthy majority and a strong majority. If we have a razor-thin majority then every vote can be problematic. Every vote on everything can be difficult," Mr. Ryan says. A larger majority, he adds, can "dictate terms," whoever ends up in the White House.\par \par \uc2 So does the 2012 vice presidential nominee think that year or 2016 was worse? He pauses a few beats.\par \par \uc2 "I don't know the answer to that yet," Mr. Ryan says.\par \par \uc2 Depends on the outcome?\par \par \uc2 "Yeah. Depends. Look, I don't mind taking hits at all. It doesn't bother me, I'm so used to that. I just want to make sure that we win. So whatever it takes to save our majority, that's my primary responsibility. So if we win and we can put these reforms in place, then it's all worth it. If we lose again, like we did in 2012, I just so deeply worry about where this country is going."\par \par \uc2 ---\par \par \uc2 Mr. Rago is a member of the Journal's editorial board.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=wjco20161022000080"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document J000000020161022ecam00022\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw272\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4080\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 REVIEW & OUTLOOK (Editorial)\par \b \uc2 Hillary's New Constitution\b0\par\par\uc2 851 \uc2 words\par \uc2 21 October 2016\par \uc2 The Wall Street Journal\par \uc2 J\par A12\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.  \par \par \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  is no legal scholar, but at Wednesday's presidential debate he showed a superior grasp of the U.S. Constitution than did \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 . Amid the overwrought liberal fainting about Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's bluster over accepting the \uc2 election\uc2  result, Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  revealed a view of the Supreme Court that is far more threatening to American liberty.\par \par \uc2 Start with her answer to moderator Chris Wallace's question about the role of the courts. "The Supreme Court should represent all of us. That's how I see the Court," she said. "And the kind of people that I would be looking to nominate to the court would be in the great tradition of standing up to the powerful, standing up on our behalf of our rights as Americans."\par \par \uc2 Where to begin with that one? The Supreme Court doesn't -- or shouldn't -- "represent" anyone. In the U.S. system that's the job of the elected branches. The courts are appointed, not elected, so they can be nonpartisan adjudicators of competing legal claims.\par \par \uc2 Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  is suggesting that the Court should be a super-legislature that vindicates the will of what she calls "the American people," which apparently excludes "the powerful." But last we checked, the Constitution protects everyone, even the powerful. The law is supposed to protect individual rights, not an abstraction called "the people."\par \par \uc2 The Democrat went downhill from there, promising to appoint judges who would essentially rewrite the First and Second Amendments. Asked about the 2008 Heller decision that upheld an individual right to bear arms, Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  claimed to support "reasonable regulation." She said she criticized Heller because it overturned a District of Columbia law intended merely "to protect toddlers from guns and so they wanted people with guns to safely store them."\par \par \uc2 Toddlers had nothing to do with it. What Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  calls "reasonable" was an outright ban on handguns. The D.C. law allowed the city's police chief to award some temporary licenses -- but not even the police officer plaintiff in the case could persuade the District to let him register a handgun to be kept at his home.\par \par \uc2 Anyone who did lawfully possess a gun had to keep it unloaded and either disassembled or bound by a trigger lock at all times, ensuring it would be inoperable and perhaps useless for self-defense. As Antonin Scalia wrote for the Heller majority, "Few laws in the history of our Nation have come close to the severe restriction of the District's handgun ban."\par \par \uc2 If Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  supports such gun restrictions, then she thinks an individual's right to bear arms is meaningless. If the Justices she appoints agree with her, then they can gradually turn Heller into a shell of a right, restriction by restriction, even without overturning the precedent.\par \par \uc2 Then there's the First Amendment, which Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  wants to rewrite by appointing Justices she said would "stand up and say no to \uc2 Citizens United\uc2 , a decision that has undermined the \uc2 election\uc2  system in our country because of the way it permits dark, unaccountable money to come into our electoral system."\par \par \uc2 Citizens United\uc2  is the 2010 Supreme Court decision that found that unions and corporations can spend money on political speech -- in that specific case for a movie that was critical of Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 . The Democrat seems to take the different view that while atomized individuals might have the right to criticize politicians, heaven forbid if they want to band together to do it as a political interest group.\par \par \uc2 As for "dark" money, she certainly knows that territory. Does money get any darker than undisclosed \uc2 Clinton\uc2  Foundation\uc2  donations from foreign business magnates tied to uranium concessions in Kazakhstan?\par \par \uc2 There is at least one right that Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  did suggest she believes to be absolute -- to an abortion, at any time during pregnancy right up until birth. She claimed merely to oppose the repeal of Roe v. Wade, which allows some regulation of late-term abortions. But she somehow overlooked Gonzales v. Carhart, the 2007 decision that upheld a legislative ban on so-called partial-birth abortion.\par \par \uc2 Justice \uc2 Anthony Kennedy\uc2  wrote the Carhart opinion that ruled such restrictions are consistent with Roe and the Constitution. Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  kept invoking "the life and the health of the mother" to justify her opposition to any limit on abortion, but Carhart found the life of the mother can be sufficient.\par \par \uc2 To put all this another way, Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  believes there is no restriction on abortion she would ever support, and there is no restriction on gun rights she would ever oppose. Carhart, \uc2 Citizens United\uc2  and Heller were 5-4 decisions, and Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  wants each of them to be litmus tests for her Supreme Court appointments. She mocks Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  for saying he won't abide by the \uc2 election\uc2  result, but she wants to rewrite the Constitution to fit her own political views.\par \par \uc2 (See related letters: "Letters to the Editor: The Oath Says: 'Preserve, Protect and Defend'" -- WSJ Oct. 29, 2016)\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=wjco20161021000059"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document J000000020161021ecal0001k\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw272\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4080\pichgoal600

\par\par \b \uc2 The Upside to an Unpopular President\b0\par\par\uc2 By Charlie Black   \par \uc2 732 \uc2 words\par \uc2 21 October 2016\par \uc2 The Wall Street Journal\par \uc2 J\par A13\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 No matter who wins the White House on Nov. 8, a majority of the country will dislike the next president. Polling this week from Gallup shows that 56% of Americans view \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  unfavorably, and 68% view \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  unfavorably. These are record numbers for presidential candidates.\par \par \uc2 But from the ashes of this ugly, bitter campaign comes a terrific opportunity for bipartisan cooperation. Because President \uc2 Clinton\uc2  or President \uc2 Trump\uc2  will be so unpopular from day one, he or she will have a strong incentive to compromise. Pursuing a partisan agenda that creates gridlock in Washington, and bitter debates that threaten to shut down the government, will only make the new president more disliked -- and re-\uc2 election\uc2  in 2020 a long shot.\par \par \uc2 Incoming White House advisers will know this. Every newly elected president appoints staff and develops a policy agenda of what the administration will try to accomplish over its first term. This substantive plan is synchronized with the political plan to get re-elected in four years. Even if the president does not have the next campaign in mind, the senior staff and outside political advisers do.\par \par \uc2 There's only one way that either of these politically crippled leaders will get anything done as president: lead an unprecedented era of bipartisan compromise between Congress and the White House. Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  and Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  are experienced negotiators. Neither is an ideologue, willing to fall on his or her sword for a philosophical cause.\par \par \uc2 History tells us that bipartisan compromise is how big issues get solved in Washington. President Reagan and Speaker Tip O'Neill saved Social Security. President George H.W. Bush reached a budget deal with Democratic leaders. President \uc2 Clinton\uc2  worked with Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott and Speaker \uc2 Newt Gingrich\uc2  to balance the budget, reform welfare and fight crime.\par \par \uc2 Today's challenges include reducing the budget deficit, reforming the tax code, repairing America's infrastructure, rebuilding the military, fixing the immigration system, and maybe even shoring up entitlement programs like Social Security and Medicare.\par \par \uc2 A single party working alone cannot address these issues. The \uc2 election\uc2  might result in divided government, with President \uc2 Clinton\uc2  facing a Republican House, or President \uc2 Trump\uc2  a Democratic Senate. But even assuming a one-party sweep, the Senate's filibuster rules mean that significant legislation must pass with 60 votes -- and support on both sides of the aisle.\par \par \uc2 The good news is that Speaker \uc2 Paul Ryan\uc2  is eager to negotiate to solve big problems. So are Mitch McConnell and \uc2 Chuck Schumer\uc2 , one of whom will be the next Senate Majority Leader. None of these leaders enjoys Congress's terrible reputation for inaction. This view is shared by the broad mainstream of both parties.\par \par \uc2 Although the House Freedom Caucus counts a few dozen hard-line conservatives among its members, congressional leaders do not need the extremists in either party to pass legislation. Hard work and serious negotiation will produce bills that a majority of Republicans and Democrats can support.\par \par \uc2 By pursuing bipartisanship, the new president might alienate some of the purists among his or her supporters. But the president will have nothing to fear from the voters at large. Most of the country craves a leader who will seek and achieve political unity to solve problems. In a September poll from \uc2 Quinnipiac University\uc2 , 76% of likely voters said it was "very important" that the next president unite the nation. That includes strong majorities of every group polled: 79% of Republicans, 77% of Democrats and 74% of independents; 68% of men and 82% of women; 76% of whites and 77% of nonwhites; 82% of seniors and 69% of millennials.\par \par \uc2 Bipartisan compromise on big issues promotes a feeling of unity and gives Americans the sense that government is working. Achieving this might provide the new president's only realistic shot at a second term. And the kicker is that it is the right thing to do for the country. Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  and Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  aren't popular, and there's only one way to win over Americans: By reaching across the aisle to fix the country's problems.\par \par \uc2 ---\par \par \uc2 Mr. Black is chairman of the Prime Policy Group and a vice chairman of No Labels.\par \par \uc2 (See related letter: "Letters to the Editor: Not Much Bipartisanship Seen in the Political Future" -- WSJ Nov. 3, 2016)\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=wjco20161021000031"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document J000000020161021ecal0000s\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 National Desk; SECTA\par \b \uc2 Videos Force Democrats on Defensive About Tricks\b0\par\par\uc2 By STEVE EDER and JONATHAN MARTIN; Alan Rappeport contributed reporting, and Kitty Bennett research. \par \uc2 1,233 \uc2 words\par \uc2 21 October 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 17\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 A Democratic operative, wearing a checkered blue shirt and a tie, spoke calmly, explaining exactly how agents could infiltrate the rallies of \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2  and cause mayhem among the Republican's nominee team, his security staff and supporters.\par \par \uc2 Creating an explosive reaction, said the operative, Scott Foval, was ''the whole point of it.''\par \par \uc2 Mr. Foval and Robert Creamer, another operative working for the \uc2 Democratic National Committee\uc2 , were the unwitting stars of undercover videos released this week in which they and others were captured discussing unseemly tactics like instigating violence at Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's rallies and arranging for fraudulent voting.\par \par \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's campaign and the party committee moved to distance themselves from the behavior described in the videos, and the committee said the two men were no longer assisting it. The party also cast doubt on the veracity of the released videos, which were produced by Project Veritas, a conservative group led by the activist James O'Keefe that has been heavily criticized as using deceptive editing.\par \par \uc2 Still, the videos were an embarrassment for Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  at a moment when she is trying to frame Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's claims of a rigged \uc2 election\uc2  as nothing more than the fevered dreams of a conspiracy theorist. During Wednesday's debate Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  referred to the videos, which together have been viewed more than eight million times on \uc2 YouTube\uc2 , as proof of unfair play.\par \par \uc2 And just months after the Democratic chairwoman, Representative \uc2 Debbie Wasserman Schultz\uc2 , was forced out of her post after hacked emails revealed party officials discussing how to damage Senator Bernie Sanders's presidential bid, the \uc2 Clinton\uc2  campaign was again forced on the defensive because of the actions of the party.\par \par \uc2 Campaign finance records show that the Democratic committee made two payments, one in July and another in August, totaling about $64,000 to Mobilize Inc., a Chicago-based firm connected to Mr. Creamer, for ''communications consulting.''\par \par \uc2 The committee said that Mr. Creamer was brought on for something relatively tame: ''bracketing,'' the industry term for when one party holds a dueling event, like a news conference, to draw attention from an opposition event.\par \par \uc2 But in the Project Veritas videos, the tactics described went far beyond mere distraction.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Creamer is not seen on the Project Veritas videos approving or endorsing plans to instigate fights at \uc2 Trump\uc2  rallies, but his underling, Mr. Foval, is shown boasting about using unseemly methods, like planting people at the gatherings to agitate the crowd.\par \par \uc2 ''Sometimes the crazies bite,'' Mr. Foval said. ''Sometimes the crazies don't bite.''\par \par \uc2 Both men and others in the videos are seen discussing -- or at least nodding along when their undercover interviewers broach the idea -- how people could illegally vote. Among the practices described are moving voters across state lines by using cars with the destination state's plates, and using pay stubs to make illegal immigrants appear to be citizens for voter registration purposes.\par \par \uc2 While the 2016 race has been remarkable for its ugly tone, there is a rich political history of campaigns pushing ethical and legal boundaries to undermine the opposition. In 1972, supporters of Richard M. Nixon, who was even better positioned to win than Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , unleashed an organized campaign of sabotage: forging letters, disrupting rallies and even flying an airplane over the Democratic National Convention that year with a banner that read ''Peace Pot Promiscuity -- Vote McGovern.''\par \par \uc2 And during the Florida presidential recount in 2000, George W. Bush's backers, including the longtime \uc2 Trump\uc2  confidant Roger J. Stone, staged the ''Brooks Brothers Riot,'' when young Republicans were flown into South Florida to disrupt the recount.\par \par \uc2 But it was unclear from the Project Veritas videos whether any of the elaborate plans had been carried out.\par \par \uc2 ''We do not believe, or have any evidence to suggest, that the activities articulated in the video actually occurred,'' said Donna Brazile, the interim Democratic chairwoman. The \uc2 Clinton\uc2  campaign similarly denounced the tactics, while chiding Project Veritas, saying it has ''been known to offering misleading video out of context.''\par \par \uc2 Mr. Creamer said in a statement on Wednesday that the ''unprofessional and careless hypothetical conversations'' caught on hidden camera were regrettable, and he denied that any of the ''schemes described'' had ever taken place.\par \par \uc2 He told The Chicago Sun-Times that one interviewer had posed as a potential donor and another as a niece of the donor, raising the possibility that people captured in the videos were merely engaging in puffery to pry some money loose.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Foval did not respond to a message seeking comment on Thursday.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Creamer is a longtime Democratic strategist from Chicago, and was a consultant during President Obama's 2008 and 2012 campaigns. According to White House guest logs, he has been a frequent visitor, usually as part of groups of Democratic activists or while accompanying his wife, Jan Schakowsky, a Democratic congresswoman from Illinois, to social events.\par \par \uc2 The hacked emails of the party committee and of \uc2 John Podesta\uc2 , the \uc2 Clinton\uc2  campaign chairman, have shown an occasional lack of coordination between the party and Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's campaign. They also give a glimpse of Mr. Creamer's role in party strategy.\par \par \uc2 During the final days of the 2012 campaign, Mr. Creamer co-hosted a call with the Democratic committee's communications director at the time, Brad Woodhouse, for supporters about the ''state of play'' in battleground states, according to Mr. Podesta's emails made public by \uc2 WikiLeaks\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 In the late spring of this year, Mr. Creamer was included and referred to on a series of internal Democratic committee emails also published by \uc2 WikiLeaks\uc2 . In one email, the party officials discussed having a presence with signs outside the \uc2 Republican National Committee\uc2  when Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  met there with Speaker Paul D. Ryan in May.\par \par \uc2 ''Discussed with Creamer, et. al today,'' wrote Eric Walker, a communications staff member.\par \par \uc2 Trump\uc2  rallies were a particularly ripe target, gatherings that have sometimes been marked by violence, as Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  revved up his supporters with tough talk and protesters tried to disrupt the events.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Foval, a seasoned field operative who has worked with People for the American Way and Americans United for Change, and others in the videos claimed credit for orchestrating some high-profile incidents, including when protesters heckled Gov. Scott Walker of Wisconsin, then a presidential candidate, at the 2015 Iowa State Fair.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Foval appeared to claim that his group had trained a 68-year-old woman who breathes with the help of an oxygen tank and was knocked to the ground during a confrontation at a \uc2 Trump\uc2  rally in North Carolina last month.\par \par \uc2 But in a phone interview Thursday, the woman, Shirley Teter, said she had attended the rally, which was near her home, on her own accord and had not received any protest training.\par \par \uc2 ''The last thing in the world I want to see is \uc2 Trump\uc2  getting elected to be our president,'' Ms. Teter said. ''It is the first time in years that my heart actually ached, and I felt I had to do it.''\par \par \uc2 Find out what you need to know about the 2016 presidential race today, and get politics news updates via \uc2 Facebook\uc2 , \uc2 Twitter\uc2  and the First Draft newsletter.\par \par \uc2 The video was made by a conservative group that has been criticized as using deceptive editing. \par \par \uc2 Document NYTF000020161022ecal0000k\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

When Mr. Podesta presented his findings five months later, he called the internet's onslaught of big data ''a historic driver of progress.'' But two short years later, as chairman of \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's presidential campaign, Mr. Podesta would also become one of the internet's most notable victims.\par \par \uc2 On Thursday, private security researchers said they had concluded that Mr. Podesta was hacked by \uc2 Russia's foreign intelligence service\uc2 , the GRU, after it tricked him into clicking on a fake \uc2 Google\uc2  login page last March, inadvertently handing over his digital credentials.\par \par \uc2 For months, the hackers mined Mr. Podesta's inbox for his most sensitive and potentially embarrassing correspondence, much of which has been posted on the \uc2 WikiLeaks\uc2  website. Additions to the collection on Thursday included three short email exchanges between Mr. Podesta and Mr. Obama himself in the days leading up to his \uc2 election\uc2  in 2008.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Podesta's emails were first published by \uc2 WikiLeaks\uc2  earlier this month. The release came just days after James R. Clapper Jr., the director of national intelligence, and the Department of Homeland Security publicly blamed Russian officials for cyberattacks on the \uc2 Democratic National Committee\uc2 , in what they described as an effort to influence the American presidential \uc2 election\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 To date, no government officials have offered evidence that the same Russian hackers behind the D.N.C. cyberattacks were also behind the hack of Mr. Podesta's emails, but an investigation by the private security researchers determined that they were the same.\par \par \uc2 Threat researchers at \uc2 Dell SecureWorks\uc2 , an Atlanta-based security firm, had been tracking the Russian intelligence group for more than a year. In June, they reported that they had uncovered a critical tool in the Russian spy campaign. \uc2 SecureWorks\uc2  researchers found that the Russian hackers were using a popular link shortening service, called Bitly, to shorten malicious links they used to send targets fake \uc2 Google\uc2  login pages to bait them into submitting their email credentials.\par \par \uc2 The hackers made a critical error by leaving some of their Bitly accounts public, making it possible for \uc2 SecureWorks\uc2  to trace 9,000 of their links to nearly 4,000 Gmail accounts targeted between October 2015 and May 2016 with fake \uc2 Google\uc2  login pages and security alerts designed to trick users into turning over their passwords.\par \par \uc2 Among the list of targets were more than 100 email addresses associated with \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's presidential campaign, including Mr. Podesta's. By June, 20 staff members for the campaign had clicked on the short links sent by Russian spies. In June, \uc2 SecureWorks\uc2  disclosed that among those whose email accounts had been targeted were staff members who advised Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  on policy and managed her travel, communications and campaign finances.\par \par \uc2 Two security researchers who have been tracking the GRU's spearphishing campaign confirmed Thursday that Mr. Podesta was among those who had inadvertently turned over his \uc2 Google\uc2  email password. The fact that Mr. Podesta was among those breached by the GRU was first disclosed Thursday by Esquire and the Motherboard blog, which published the link Russian spies used against Mr. Podesta.\par \par \uc2 ''The new public data confirming the Russians are behind the hack of \uc2 John Podesta\uc2 's email is a big deal,'' Jake Sullivan, Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's senior policy adviser, said Thursday. ''There is no longer any doubt that Putin is trying to help \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  by weaponizing \uc2 WikiLeaks\uc2 .''\par \par \uc2 The new release of Mr. Podesta's email exchange with Mr. Obama from 2008 made clear that Mr. Obama's team was confident he would win.\par \par \uc2 In one of the emails, Mr. Podesta wrote Mr. Obama a lengthy memo in the evening on \uc2 Election\uc2  Day recommending that he not accept an invitation from President George W. Bush to attend an emergency meeting of the \uc2 Group of 20\uc2  leaders.\par \par \uc2 ''Attendance alongside President Bush will create an extremely awkward situation,'' the memo said. ''If you attempt to dissociate yourself from his positions, you will be subject to criticism for projecting a divided United States to the rest of the world. But if you adopt a more reserved posture, you will be associated not only with his policies, but also with his very tenuous global standing.''\par \par \uc2 The White House did not respond to questions about the email.\par \par \uc2 Follow The \uc2 New York Times\uc2 's politics and Washington coverage on \uc2 Facebook\uc2  and \uc2 Twitter\uc2 , and sign up for the First Draft politics newsletter.\par \par \uc2 Correction: October 22, 2016, Saturday\par \par \uc2 This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article on Friday about suspected email hacking by \uc2 Russia's foreign intelligence service\uc2  misstated the name of one organization that first disclosed that a presidential counselor, \uc2 John D. Podesta\uc2 , was among those whose accounts were breached. The blog is Motherboard, not VICE Motherload.\par \par \uc2 Document NYTF000020161022ecal0000h\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 A well-intentioned producer once said to me, ''John, you're so talented, but too bad you're Latin -- otherwise you'd be so much further along.'' When I pitched a movie about Latinos, another producer said: ''Latin? People don't want to see Latin people.'' This is not just my experience but a typical Latino person's experience in America.\par \par \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2  has done one good thing. He has galvanized a conflicted and diverse community. For years, activists and politicians have struggled to get Latinos to vote and show their power. But not until Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's racist rhetoric shone a light on anti-Latino sentiment did we feel the need to make our voices heard on the issues that matter to us: from proper funding for our schools, better infrastructure in our communities and financial aid, to health care that doesn't consider poverty a pre-existing condition.\par \par \uc2 There are around 56 million of us. We are the largest ethnic minority in the United States, at almost 18 percent of the country's population. And yet Latino students drop out of high school at a higher rate than members of any other minority. We are victims of neglect, discrimination and ignorance. We have grown up amid an entrenched disrespect for Latin culture, and we have often internalized that disrespect.\par \par \uc2 The dominant narrative is that we have just ''illegally'' crossed the border or are ''fresh off the boat.'' In fact the Spanish are evidence of America's first original sin: We were mistreating indigenous people here long before the British brought slaves to the colonies. People forget that Latinos founded some of America's first cities.\par \par \uc2 Latinos have been dying for America since before we were a nation. Why have our children not heard that thousands of Latino patriots fought for America in the Revolutionary War? Bernardo de G\u225\'00\'E1lvez, a Spanish general, recruited Mexicans, Cubans, Native Americans and free African-Americans to fight against the British in the South, while Cuban women donated their jewelry and money to help the patriots. Where is the Ken Burns documentary about that?\par \par \uc2 Why don't they know about the many Latinos in the War of 1812? Or anything of the 20,000 Latinos who fought valiantly in the Civil War? Or of those who earned Purple Hearts or the Croix de Guerre in World War I? Or of the up to 500,000 who served in the military in World War II?\par \par \uc2 It's as if our heroism and sacrifice somehow counted less, as if we didn't exist in history at all. Without a past to glorify and uplift you, how do you propel yourself into an unknown, tenuous future?\par \par \uc2 I'm only an amateur historian. But I am an expert on my own life and career. So to bring it around to more contemporary slights: Hispanics are the most underrepresented ethnic group in film and television. ''Saturday Night Live'' has only just hired its first Latina comic. Are we really to believe there are so few funny Latinos? We are similarly marginalized in business and corporate life.\par \par \uc2 This exclusion sends a painful message to every Latino child about how he is seen and judged. Latino people face a double challenge: to create our own positive self-image while battling against the way the broader society portrays us. Without textbooks in schools that do justice to our contributions to the making of America, and without media representation expanding to include more Latin faces and voices, we are vulnerable to a demagogue like Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  claiming that we are all ''drug dealers,'' ''rapists'' and ''criminals.''\par \par \uc2 But a range of studies find no link between violent crime and immigration. The fact is that immigrants as a group commit far fewer crimes than the rest of the American population. Almost every immigrant is just here to make a better life for himself.\par \par \uc2 That can be hard to do when the states where many immigrants live -- Texas and Arizona in particular -- gerrymander Latino communities out of political power and limit funding to their neighborhoods. Latinos aren't uniformly liberal; some are conservative because of their religious beliefs or fiscal views. And yet if all of the eligible Latinos voted, a number of states would turn from red to blue.\par \par \uc2 We need a Latino Spring in this country. We need to demand power and equal opportunity. A friend of mine recently did a small experiment to tease out anti-Latin sentiment. She sent out two r\u233\'00\'E9sum\u233\'00\'E9s for an acting job with her picture attached. She happens to be very dark skinned (''morena,'' as we say in Spanish). On one r\u233\'00\'E9sum\u233\'00\'E9 she used her own traditionally Latina-sounding name, while on the other she used a traditionally white-sounding name. The Latina name received zero callbacks while the white name received a few responses.\par \par \uc2 Where else is this racial profiling going on while we are ''living while Latin''? It is going on while we are working for the promotion that doesn't come, while we are trying to rent an \uc2 Airbnb\uc2  for vacation but no one will respond, while we are hoping to make our children's lives better than our own.\par \par \uc2 Latinos need to demand our place in American history, and in corporate, political and social fields. We must demand an equal share of the American dream, and not accept a downgraded version of it. We need to stop accepting exclusion over persecution. In this critical \uc2 election\uc2 , and in the future, I urge you all to register and vote, to be counted and heard.\par \par \uc2 Follow The \uc2 New York Times\uc2  Opinion section on \uc2 Facebook\uc2  and \uc2 Twitter\uc2  (@NYTOpinion) , and sign up for the Opinion Today newsletter .\par \par \uc2 John Leguizamo (@JohnLeguizamo) is an actor, writer and producer.

\par\par \uc2 Business/Financial Desk; SECT\par \b \uc2 Morning Agenda: A Billionaire's Ties to \uc2 Trump\uc2 , SoFi Commitments, \uc2 Steven Cohen\uc2 's Return\b0\par\par\uc2 By AMIE TSANG \par \uc2 552 \uc2 words\par \uc2 21 October 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 The New York Times on the Web\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 In the third and final debate, \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2  said that he might not accept the results of next month's \uc2 election\uc2  if he feels it has been rigged, casting doubt on the country's democracy.\par \par \uc2 Acceptance seems to be an issue for his campaign.\par \par \uc2 In Silicon Valley, technology executives are having to explain why they continue to do business with the billionaire investor \uc2 Peter Thiel\uc2 , who donated $1.25 million to Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's campaign.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Thiel will address the controversy in a speech in Washington this month. But executives with ties to him have had to explain why they have not cut them.\par \par \uc2 And they have faced criticism.\par \par \uc2 ''We agree that people shouldn't be fired for their political views, but this isn't a disagreement on tax policy, this is advocating hatred and violence,'' wrote Ellen Pao, the head of Project Include, an organization that aims to increase diversity in the tech industry. Project Include has severed ties with \uc2 Y Combinator\uc2 , where Mr. Thiel is a part-time partner, because of his involvement.\par \par \uc2 SoFi Seeks Commitment\par \par \uc2 Social Finance Inc\uc2 . wants longer-term relationships with its borrowers, and it seems it wants its borrowers to have longer-term relationships as well.\par \par \uc2 The company is running singles events, as well as providing career counseling and wine tasting, in an attempt to enmesh itself further into the lives of its customers.\par \par \uc2 It is trying to attract its potential customer base, so-called Henrys (an acronym for high earners, not rich yet), as well as investors who quickly fled from the online lending industry after \uc2 Lending Club\uc2  acknowledged that it had misstated financial records and dumped its founder.\par \par \uc2 And SoFi does seem to be on the rebound, handling more student, personal and home loans than it was before the \uc2 Lending Club\uc2  crisis.\par \par \uc2 The singles nights are helping.\par \par \uc2 ''They are making their customers into better risks and more committed customers,'' said one attendee, Kim Hutchison. ''I'm jealous of their business model. I wish I had thought of it.''\par \par \uc2 Steven Cohen\uc2  Mulls Return\par \par \uc2 Steven A. Cohen\uc2  is a little closer to making his return to the hedge fund industry.\par \par \uc2 He is barred from managing money for others and his former hedge fund pleaded guilty to insider trading, but the new investment firm he opened this year will probably begin raising money from outside investors in early 2018, when the prohibition expires.\par \par \uc2 The move to open the firm, Stamford Harbor Capital, has already provoked anger.\par \par \uc2 Senator Elizabeth Warren, Democrat of Massachusetts, sent a letter to the \uc2 Securities and Exchange Commission\uc2  in April saying that the firm made a mockery of the agency's mission to protect investors.\par \par \uc2 Coming Up\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 European Central Bank\uc2  will announce the results of its latest monetary policy meeting. Most economists expect it to leave its benchmark interest rate unchanged. Investors will be watching for details of further plans for the bank's stimulus program.\par \par \uc2 Microsoft\uc2  should finally provide more detail on how its cloud business is performing, data that investors have been clamoring for.\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 Federal Reserve Bank of New York\uc2  will host a conference on culture and behavior in the financial services industry.\par \par \uc2 Follow Amie Tsang on Twitter @amietsang .\par \par \uc2 Document NYTF000020161021ecal00043\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , who has been in politics all her adult life, seems to have learned something from \uc2 Michelle Obama\uc2 , who has never run for public office. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  gave three masterful answers in the debate Wednesday night that were tonally different from her normal clich\u233\'00\'E9s.\par \par \uc2 They were about \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2 's alleged assaults on women, his refusal to respect the democratic process and the contrast between his years of ''Celebrity Apprentice'' experience and her own governing experience. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's answers were given in a slow and understated manner, but they were marked by moral passion, clarity and quiet contempt.\par \par \uc2 They were not spoken from the point of view of a politician. They were spoken from the point of view of a parent, which is the point of view \uc2 Michelle Obama\uc2  frequently uses. The politician asks: What can I offer to win votes? The parent asks: What world are my children going out into when they leave the house?\par \par \uc2 The politician is focused on individual interest, but the parent is interested in the shared social, economic and moral environment.\par \par \uc2 That turns out to be a useful frame for this ugly year. It's becoming ever clearer that the nation's moral capital is being decimated, and the urgent challenge is to name that decimation and reverse it.\par \par \uc2 Moral capital is the set of shared habits, norms, institutions and values that make common life possible. Left to our own, we human beings have an impressive capacity for selfishness. Unadorned, the struggle for power has a tendency to become barbaric. So people in decent societies agree on a million informal restraints -- codes of politeness, humility and mutual respect that girdle selfishness and steer us toward reconciliation.\par \par \uc2 This year \uc2 Trump\uc2  is dismantling those restraints one by one. By savagely attacking Carly Fiorina's looks and Ted Cruz's wife he dismantled the codes of etiquette that prevent politics from becoming an unmodulated screaming match. By lying more or less all the time, he dismantles the fealty to truth without which conversation is impossible. By refusing to automatically respect the \uc2 election\uc2  results he corrodes confidence in our common institutions and risks turning public life into a never-ending dogfight.\par \par \uc2 Clinton\uc2  has contributed to the degradation too. As the James O'Keefe videos remind us, wherever \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  has gone in her career, a cloud of unsavory people and unsavory behavior has traveled alongside. But she is right to emphasize that \uc2 Trump\uc2  is the greatest threat to moral capital in recent history and that the health of that capital is more fundamental than any particular policy position.\par \par \uc2 The sad fact is that in the realm of common life, gnats can undo the work of giants. ''Moral communities are fragile things, hard to build and easy to destroy,'' Jonathan Haidt writes in his book ''The Righteous Mind.'' ''When we think about very large communities such as nations, the challenge is extraordinary and the threat of moral entropy is intense.''\par \par \uc2 We are now in a country in which major presidential candidates can gibe about the menstrual cycles of their interviewers and the penis size of their opponents. We are now in a society in which the childish desires of a reality-TV narcissist can insult the inheritance that Washington and Hamilton risked their lives to bequeath. We are now in a society in which serial insults to basic decency aren't automatically disqualifying.\par \par \uc2 Clearly, we have a giant task of moral repair ahead of us. That starts with a renunciation of the \uc2 Trump\uc2  style. One big lesson of 2016 is that that can only happen if people police members of their own party. If somebody is destroying the basic social and moral fabric through brutalistic rhetoric and vicious misogynistic behavior, it doesn't really matter that he agrees with you on taxes and the Supreme Court; he has to be renounced or else he will drag the whole society to a level of degradation that will make all decent politics impossible.\par \par \uc2 It also means addressing the substantive social chasms that fueled \uc2 Trump\uc2 's rise. We are clearly going to have a lot of angry populists around in the years ahead, of right and left. It should be possible to oppose them with a political movement that champions dynamism with cohesion, globalism with solidarity -- a movement that supports free trade, open skilled immigration, ethnic diversity and a free American-led world order, but also local community building, state-fostered economic security, moral cohesion and patriotic purpose.\par \par \uc2 In other words, it should be possible to be conservative on macroeconomics, liberal on immigration policy, traditionalist on moral and civic matters, Swedish on welfare state policies, and Reaganesque on America's role in the world.\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 election\uc2  of 2016 has exposed the staleness of the Republican and Democratic ideologies. It has also established a nihilistic, reality TV standard of conduct that will pull down the country if it is allowed to survive. The one nice thing about \uc2 Trump\uc2  is that he has prompted so many people to find their voice, and to turn from their revulsion to a higher alternative.\par \par \uc2 Follow The \uc2 New York Times\uc2  Opinion section on \uc2 Facebook\uc2  and \uc2 Twitter\uc2  (@NYTopinion), and sign up for the Opinion Today newsletter.\par \par \uc2 Document NYTF000020161021ecal0003p\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 CRITIC'S NOTEBOOK\par \uc2 National Desk; SECTA\par \b \uc2 Was That a Presidential Debate or a Pitch for an Edgy \uc2 Trump\uc2  Channel?\b0\par\par\uc2 By JAMES PONIEWOZIK \par \uc2 1,014 \uc2 words\par \uc2 21 October 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 16\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Was Wednesday the final presidential debate of 2016 or the opening night of the \uc2 Trump\uc2  News Channel?\par \par \uc2 Earlier in the week, The \uc2 Financial Times\uc2  reported that \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's son-in-law had met with investors about possibly starting a television network. And a half-hour before the debate, we got a sneak preview of what \uc2 Trump\uc2  TV might look like, via Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's \uc2 Facebook\uc2  page.\par \par \uc2 ''If you're tired of biased, mainstream media reporting (otherwise known as Crooked Hillary's super PAC),'' Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  posted, ''tune into my \uc2 Facebook\uc2  Live broadcast.''\par \par \uc2 That ramshackle pregame show was like state television produced by QVC, with interviews by, of and for Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's supporters, cable-news-like graphics and a relentless sales pitch.\par \par \uc2 Trump\uc2  endorsers, including the former Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer and Gen. Michael T. Flynn pre-hyped the debate. \uc2 Ivanka \uc2 Trump\uc2 , in a taped message, called for donations and promised, ''My father will make us all proud!'' There were ''ad breaks'' for Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's campaign spots. Even he could not call this coverage rigged against him.\par \par \uc2 From the beginning, the former ''Apprentice'' host has approached this campaign like a programmer, assiduously feeding the beast to maximize free media coverage of his rallies.\par \par \uc2 On Wednesday, he dominated the pre-debate chatter by inviting to the event a list of provocative guests -- among them \uc2 Sarah Palin\uc2 , Barack Obama's half brother and the mother of a man killed in the attack at Benghazi -- as if he were casting a reality show: ''So You Think You Can Rattle \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 .''\par \par \uc2 Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  had the more normal, boring job at the final debate, something you might recognize from a past \uc2 election\uc2  cycle, before we all entered Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's reality. As the front-runner, she sought to protect her lead and make a final case, needling her opponent strategically and deflecting potential damage (including questions on the \uc2 Clinton\uc2  Foundation\uc2  and the revelations from \uc2 WikiLeaks\uc2 ).\par \par \uc2 But there were two Donald Trumps at the debate, at the \uc2 University of Nevada, Las Vegas\uc2 , with two conflicting missions. The presidential candidate, trailing in the polls, was looking at his last chance to broaden his appeal for a general electorate. The possible future media mogul had to service a passionate niche audience that expects edgier content.\par \par \uc2 The candidate showed up first. Prompted by the moderator, Chris Wallace of Fox, to discuss the Supreme Court, the two nominees actually discussed it. It was the kind of debate Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  might have imagined having against, say, Jeb Bush, in which two politicians soberly contrast positions on judicial issues -- abortion, gun regulation -- that don't involve one throwing the other in jail.\par \par \uc2 It was not a friendly meeting. There were no handshakes, before or after the face-off. But Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  was more stone-faced and conscious of his body language than at the first debate, where he raged, or the second, where he loomed. He declined the bait early when Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  accused him of having ''choked'' in a meeting with the president of Mexico.\par \par \uc2 But like the previous two debates, this one took a turn, as Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  the performer gave in to the urge to riff and mix it up.\par \par \uc2 It played like a preview reel of \uc2 Trump\uc2  TV attractions. There was an old-timey Western, in which Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  promised to rid the country of ''bad hombres'' from across the border. There was a Charlie McCarthy routine, as Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  called Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  a ''puppet'' of Russia's president, \uc2 Vladimir V. Putin\uc2 , and he responded: ''No puppet. You're the puppet!'' At times, the glowering candidate seemed to be imitating \uc2 Alec Baldwin\uc2  on ''Saturday Night Live'' imitating him.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Wallace had raised concerns earlier that he would be a laissez-faire moderator, saying that it was not his role to fact-check candidates. But he proved a tough disciplinarian, policing not only the candidates but -- at long last -- the crowd, whose hooting and cheering he shut down. (Memo to America in 2020: No more debate audiences, ever.)\par \par \uc2 Mr. Wallace prompted the biggest headline of the night, asking Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , who has charged that the \uc2 election\uc2  is rigged against him, if he will accept the results of the vote. ''I will tell you at the time,'' Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  said. ''I'll keep you in suspense, O.K.?''\par \par \uc2 In other words: Stay tuned for the shocking series finale of ''America''!\par \par \uc2 Was it a mistake? For a candidate trying to reassure a general-\uc2 election\uc2  audience, you would think so. That candidate might also -- already under fire for his treatment of women -- not volunteer the sound bite, ''Such a nasty woman,'' when Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  dinged him for avoiding taxes.\par \par \uc2 But for the potential owner-operator-star of \uc2 Trump\uc2  TV, it was all branding.\par \par \uc2 Ask Roger Ailes, late of Fox News, who has advised Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , or Stephen Bannon, of Breitbart News, who is his campaign chief executive: A loyal political-media audience needs continual grievance and craves conflict. They're against you! They robbed us! Only I will fight for you, as long as you don't change the channel!\par \par \uc2 After the debate, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's surrogates spun his comments for the general electorate. Surely, they said, he must have meant that he was keeping his options open in case the \uc2 election\uc2  required a recount.\par \par \uc2 But on Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's \uc2 Facebook\uc2  Live aftershow, no explanation was necessary. ''That was the greatest Republican debate performance since Abraham Lincoln!'' said Jeff DeWit, the \uc2 Trump\uc2  campaign's chief operating officer. The crawl at the bottom of the screen blared, ''IN A FANTASTIC DEBATE \uc2 DONALD \uc2 TRUMP\uc2  MAKES HIS CASE TO BE THE PRESIDENT.''\par \par \uc2 One way or another, the production suggested, come Nov. 9, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  will still be around to give his audience a show.\par \par \uc2 The Harlem Tavern in New York during the debate. Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2  seemed to act as a candidate and a future media mogul.

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 There were no handshakes or pleasantries between \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  and \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2  in their final debate, which moved quickly from a discussion of policy to a flurry of personal attacks.\par \par \uc2 She called him a ''puppet'' of Russia, he called her ''a nasty woman.'' While Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  appeared sharp and steady in the early moments of the debate, his refusal to say he would accept the results of the \uc2 election\uc2  and his meandering answers on foreign policy led many commentators and critics to declare that Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  was the clear winner.\par \par \uc2 Here is a sampling of post-debate reaction:\par \par \uc2 ''\uc2 Clinton\uc2  really is doing well tonight. Again and again, she's taken \uc2 Trump\uc2  apart.''\par \par \uc2 James Astill, Washington bureau chief of The Economist\par \par \uc2 ''Though his temper slipped a few times, he was generally less of a boorish oaf this time than he typically is. In that way, he certainly gave people holding out some modicum of shelter to consider him.''\par \par \uc2 Caleb Howe, writer for the conservative blog Red State\par \par \uc2 ''This was the Democratic nominee's best debate performance. She finally figured out the right calibration of ignoring and engaging \uc2 Trump\uc2 .''\par \par \uc2 Chris Cillizza, writer for the Washington Post blog ''The Fix''\par \par \uc2 ''What's the \uc2 Trump\uc2  dictionary definition of a woman who is prepared, earnest, ambitious and ready to move past mistakes? Oh yes, nasty.''\par \par \uc2 Rituparna Chatterjee, deputy editor of Huffington Post India\par \par \uc2 ''Hillary is nasty. Good that \uc2 Trump\uc2  pointed it out.''\par \par \uc2 Ann Coulter, conservative commentator and author\par \par \uc2 ''\uc2 Trump\uc2  won. Hillary spun.''\par \par \uc2 Michelle Malkin, senior editor of Conservative Review\par \par \uc2 ''It's completely heartbreaking to see \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  so outclass a Republican nominee across 3 debates.''\par \par \uc2 Rich Lowry, editor of the conservative National Review\par \par \uc2 ''He should have said he would accept the results of the \uc2 election\uc2 . There is no other option unless we're in a recount again.''\par \par \uc2 Laura Ingraham, editor in chief of the conservative website LifeZette\par \par \uc2 ''His only use of Spanish in \uc2 election\uc2  was to further nasty stereotypes against Latino immigrants -- and ONLY Latino immigrants.''\par \par \uc2 Van Jones, Democratic commentator for CNN\par \par \uc2 ''She devastated him. He melted down. His refusal to accept the results of this \uc2 election\uc2  disqualifies him automatically from any office in the United States. There were several areas where he was utterly incoherent, grasping at 'facts,' without any understanding of policy. His personal foulness emerged.''\par \par \uc2 Andrew Sullivan\uc2 , blogger for New York Magazine\par \par \uc2 ''Chris Wallace is the real winner of this debate. America is the loser. At least this one was substantive and stayed on topic.''\par \par \uc2 Meghan McCain, host of America Now Radio\par \par \uc2 ''The Emmys are NOT rigged.''\par \par \uc2 Julia Louis-Dreyfus, the actress who played Elaine on ''Seinfeld''\par \par \uc2 ''Debate 1: Dying of excitement\par \par \uc2 Debate 2: We're all going to die\par \par \uc2 Debate 3: Kill me already.''\par \par \uc2 James Poniewozik, television critic for The \uc2 New York Times\par \par \uc2 Find out what you need to know about the 2016 presidential race today, and get politics news updates via \uc2 Facebook\uc2 , \uc2 Twitter\uc2  and the First Draft newsletter.\par \par \uc2 Document NYTF000020161021ecal00075\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 Express; SECT\par \b \uc2 'Nasty Woman' and 'Bad Hombres': The Real Debate Winners?\b0\par\par\uc2 By ERIN McCANN and JONAH ENGEL BROMWICH \par \uc2 1,009 \uc2 words\par \uc2 21 October 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 The New York Times on the Web\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 In one corner, we had ''bad hombres.'' In the other, ''nasty woman.''\par \par \uc2 The phrases were both uttered by \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2  during the third and final debate against \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  on Wednesday night in Las Vegas, in the bitter race for the White House.\par \par \uc2 And the internet pounced, adding them to its meme factory and its profiteering assembly line, even as the terms drew mocking comments and disgust from social media users.\par \par \uc2 Within hours, dozens of sellers on \uc2 Etsy\uc2  had whipped up merchandise -- T-shirts and buttons -- bearing both slogans. The comedian Chelsea Handler tossed out a poll to \uc2 Twitter\uc2  users: ''Are you a bad hombre or a nasty woman?'' After about 12 hours, ''nasty woman'' was winning with 60 percent of the vote.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , the Republican nominee, unfurled the ''hombre'' line when he took on a question about immigration from the moderator, Chris Wallace.\par \par \uc2 ''And once the border is secured, at a later date, we'll make a determination as to the rest. But we have some bad hombres here, and we're going to get them out,'' he said.\par \par \uc2 Critics howled that the phrase was racist and in line with his previous description of undocumented Mexican immigrants as criminals, drug dealers and ''rapists,'' though he allowed at the time that some of them were ''good people.''\par \par \uc2 How did Mexicans view the rhetoric on Wednesday night? The crowd watching the debate at a barbecue restaurant in Mexico City laughed when Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  reiterated his deportation promise, according to The Associated Press.\par \par \uc2 Later in the debate, as Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , the Democratic nominee, was explaining her plan to improve the Social Security program, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  muttered, ''Such a nasty woman.''\par \par \uc2 That set off a fierce reaction on \uc2 Twitter\uc2 , as women sought to reclaim and embrace a label that many saw as another in a long line of sexist insults unleashed by Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  at women.\par \par \uc2 Nasty Woman seeks Bad Hombre to share long walks on the beach, leisurely afternoons reading, and trading off who is the real puppet. -- Jill Filipovic (@JillFilipovic) October 20, 2016\par \par \uc2 ''From one #NastyWoman to another, you were an inspiration last night,'' \uc2 Nancy Pelosi\uc2 , the former speaker of the House, tweeted on Thursday about Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 ''RT if you're a nasty woman and it's made your life a freakin' pleasure,'' Lena Dunham, the actress and creator of ''Girls,'' posted on \uc2 Twitter\uc2 . Within an hour, it had 1,300 retweets.\par \par \uc2 At Vox, the writer Liz Plank said the phrase was ''the feminist rallying cry that \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  needed.''\par \par \uc2 A Janet Jackson fan went into action and spliced footage of the debate into a video of her 1986 song ''Nasty.'' (Spotify said streams of Ms. Jackson's original hit surged 250 percent.)\par \par \uc2 Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  herself brushed off the comment. ''I just didn't pay any attention to that,'' she said after the debate.\par \par \uc2 Well behaved women rarely make history #nastywoman pic.twitter.com/fEoKIfbjyO -- Ruth Lapointe (@Ruth1Lapointe) October 20, 2016\par \par \uc2 In any event, someone created a blunt domain name that declares ''nasty women'' get stuff done, and redirected it to hillaryclinton.com.\par \par \uc2 Merriam Webster said ''hombre'' and ''nasty'' both topped its list of the most-searched words during the debate -- as did ''omber,'' an old card game, and ''ombr\u233\'00\'E9,'' a type of hair style that involves colors fading into each other. The dictionary cited uses of the phrase ''bad hombre'' as far back as the 19th century.\par \par \uc2 Aight, this bad hombre's gotta pack for London. Ta-ta for now! pic.twitter.com/0NObMJJTRz -- Lin-Manuel Miranda (@Lin_Manuel) October 20, 2016\par \par \uc2 The memes also quickly gained steam on the online marketplace. Some of the craftspeople who sell merchandise on \uc2 Etsy\uc2  were primed to take advantage of an \uc2 election\uc2  that tends to offer up memes on a daily basis.\par \par \uc2 Ginger Knight of Philadelphia, who described herself as ''not really that political,'' said she was more focused on the Republican nominee, reading \uc2 Facebook\uc2  statuses to see which of Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's phrases were catching on with other users. ''And I just started making word buttons,'' she said.\par \par \uc2 She made a ''bad hombres'' button, a ''nasty woman'' button and a ''rigged'' button, among others. They've been selling ''every couple of minutes'' she said.\par \par \uc2 Laura Brittain, another \uc2 Etsy\uc2  user and a Democrat from North Carolina, said that her source for quotes most likely to sell well on \uc2 Etsy\uc2  came from her teenage daughter.\par \par \uc2 ''If we're watching the debate and something comes up and our 17-year-old daughter keeps bringing it up, we usually make a shirt or make something,'' she said.\par \par \uc2 ''Last night she just kept saying, 'He reminds me of an angry Cheetoh,' '' she said of Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 . While she was planning to vote for Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , Ms. Brittain said, she wasn't particularly enthusiastic.\par \par \uc2 Others saw their use of Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's comments as a form of political expression. Erin Boyd of Bellingham, Wash., who has been on \uc2 Etsy\uc2  for about a decade, made her own version of the ''nasty woman'' T-shirt.\par \par \uc2 ''I don't usually make meme-type shirts,'' she said. ''But in this \uc2 election\uc2 , you just can't not. It's so easy because there have been so many amazing quotes from Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 .''\par \par \uc2 Ms. Boyd, a registered Democrat, sold out of the shirts overnight and re-listed them Thursday morning, interrupting a phone conversation to remark that she had just sold another one.\par \par \uc2 ''They're selling like literal hot cakes,'' she said. ''It's insane.''\par \par \uc2 She said this was a particularly compelling \uc2 election\uc2  for women given the contrast between the two candidates, and that she planned on voting for Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 ''We have a woman running for president. Her opponent is a man from whom we can get quotes like'' this and '' 'such a nasty woman,' '' she said, before pausing to think.\par \par \uc2 ''It's sort of like the high and low of being a woman in America,'' she added.\par \par \uc2 Document NYTF000020161021ecal0007b\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 National Desk; SECTA\par \b \uc2 Trump\uc2  and \uc2 Clinton\uc2  Both Accelerated Spending in September, Federal Reports Show\b0\par\par\uc2 By NICHOLAS CONFESSORE \par \uc2 655 \uc2 words\par \uc2 21 October 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 19\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2  and \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  unleashed a barrage of spending in September, with both candidates burning through more money than they raised as the fall campaign sprint began.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  spent $70 million in September, according to reports filed Thursday with the \uc2 Federal \uc2 Election\uc2  Commission\uc2 , more than double the $30 million his campaign laid out in August and more than three times what he spent in July. He began the final full month of the campaign with just $35 million in cash on hand.\par \par \uc2 Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's campaign spent even more, $95 million, according to figures provided by her campaign, and began October with $59 million on hand. Both candidates' coffers are relatively small by the standards of modern campaigns.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's campaign spent at least $1 million on his own aircraft and \uc2 Trump\uc2 -owned hotels, resorts or office buildings. In addition to the $21 million Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  spent on online advertising -- his single largest expense -- he was billed at least $5 million by Cambridge Analytica, a publicity-shy data mining and analytics firm owned by Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's chief financial benefactor, the wealthy investor Robert Mercer.\par \par \uc2 The purpose of the spending was listed as ''data management'' in \uc2 election\uc2  commission reports. In August, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  paid the same firm just $250,000.\par \par \uc2 Despite Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's cultivated image as a candidate who tells it as it is and draws his inspiration from his crowds, his campaign also paid at least five pollsters in September. The month began a period in which Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  has struggled to stay on message and find a solid footing against Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , while he feuded with a former beauty queen and fended off accusations of sexual harassment and abuse from a growing roster of women.\par \par \uc2 And even as the Democrats vastly out-organized Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , his spending on payroll went up only modestly in September, suggesting that he has given up on trying to compete with Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  in the field. While she has a staff of hundreds, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  has reliably spent more on hats and other merchandise for supporters than he has on staff.\par \par \uc2 He also reported what was said to be a final payout of $100,000 to his former campaign manager, \uc2 Corey Lewandowski\uc2 , who was fired months ago but continues to travel with Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  on the trail.\par \par \uc2 All in all, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's campaign took in about $55 million in September compared with $84 million for Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , according to a tally her campaign released this month, a record for the Democratic nominee in her second presidential bid.\par \par \uc2 While presidential campaigns typically accelerate their spending heavily in the fall, they also usually keep raising more and more money as party donors come off the sidelines and the stakes of the race become clear. But Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's fund-raising has remained relatively flat since he became the nominee.\par \par \uc2 Two-thirds of the cash his campaign raised in September came directly from grass-roots supporters, indicating his struggles in bringing wealthy Republican donors on board. On Thursday, his campaign announced via text message that Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  had raised $9 million in a single day from 125,000 people after the third and final presidential debate.\par \par \uc2 More money is sitting in joint funds whose proceeds are shared with Republican Party committees, though it is unclear exactly how much of that is owed to Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's campaign.\par \par \uc2 ''Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  has said many times that this is not a campaign, it's a movement,'' said Brad Parscale, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's digital director, in an email.\par \par \uc2 Find out what you need to know about the 2016 presidential race today, and get politics news updates via \uc2 Facebook\uc2 , \uc2 Twitter\uc2  and the First Draft newsletter.\par \par \uc2 Supporters wore \uc2 Trump\uc2  hats at a campaign rally in April.

\par\par \uc2 National Desk; SECTA\par \b \uc2 In Night of Punch Lines, \uc2 Trump\uc2 's Routine Prompts New York's Elite to Heckle\b0\par\par\uc2 By MATT FLEGENHEIMER and ASHLEY PARKER; Maggie Haberman contributed reporting \par \uc2 1,253 \uc2 words\par \uc2 21 October 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 19\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2  began this quadrennial exercise in campaign humility and self-deprecation on Thursday by comparing himself to the son of God -- just another ''carpenter working for his father'' in his youth.\par \par \uc2 By the end, facing cascading and uncomfortable jeers from a crowd full of white ties and gowns, he had called \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  Catholic-hating, ''so corrupt'' and potentially jail-bound in a prospective \uc2 Trump\uc2  administration.\par \par \uc2 ''I don't know who they're angry at, Hillary, you or I,'' Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  said sheepishly from the dais, turning to his opponent amid the heckling.\par \par \uc2 It seemed clear to everyone else. Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  was being booed at a charity dinner.\par \par \uc2 So it went at the \uc2 Alfred E. Smith Memorial Foundation\uc2  Dinner in Manhattan, a presidential campaign ritual of levity and feigned warmth -- upended, like so much else in this \uc2 election\uc2  season, by the gale-force bid of Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Breaking with decades of tradition at the gathering once he took the microphone, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  set off on a blistering, grievance-filled performance that translated poorly to the staid setting, stunning many of the well-heeled guests who had filed into the Waldorf Astoria hotel for an uncommon spectacle: an attempted d\u233\'00\'E9tente in a campaign so caustic that the candidates, less than 24 hours earlier, declined to shake hands on a debate stage.\par \par \uc2 Relations did not much improve.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's set began typically enough. He joked about the size of his hands and Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's comparatively small crowds. He even very nearly poked fun at himself -- insofar as a zinger about his wife, and her partly plagiarized Republican convention speech, qualifies -- when discussing the ''biased'' news media.\par \par \uc2 ''You want the proof? \uc2 Michelle Obama\uc2  gives a speech, and everyone loves it,'' Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  said. ''My wife, Melania, gives the exact same speech and people get on her case.''\par \par \uc2 Some sharper jokes about Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  seemed to edge just to the line.\par \par \uc2 ''Just before taking the dais, Hillary accidentally bumped into me. And she very civilly said, 'Pardon me,''' Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  said, as murmurs filled the room. ''I very politely replied, 'Let me talk to you about that after I get into office.'''\par \par \uc2 Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , seeming to get the joke before some others, bellowed before the punch line.\par \par \uc2 But quickly, his remarks took a more menacing turn.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  said Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  was merely ''pretending not to hate Catholics,'' an allusion to hacked correspondences from \uc2 Clinton\uc2  aides that appeared to include messages criticizing Roman Catholic conservatism.\par \par \uc2 He wondered aloud how someone like Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  -- ''so corrupt,'' he said -- could sell herself to the American people. ''What's her pitch?'' he asked. ''The economy is busted, the government's corrupt, Washington is failing. Vote for me.''\par \par \uc2 He fake-griped that ''all the jokes were given to her in advance.''\par \par \uc2 He appeared to disparage the \uc2 Clinton\uc2  Foundation\uc2 's oft-criticized efforts in Haiti.\par \par \uc2 ''As some of you have noticed, Hillary isn't laughing as much as the rest of us,'' he said.\par \par \uc2 By then, he had decisively lost the room.\par \par \uc2 As for Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , she began with some easy self-deprecation.\par \par \uc2 ''I took a break from my rigorous nap schedule to be here,'' she said, adding, ''Usually, I charge a lot for speeches like this.''\par \par \uc2 But she quickly turned to more cutting satire, joking that Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  was ''translating from the original Russian'' on his teleprompters and wondering just how President Obama might be able to visit the White House for a reunion of former presidents under a \uc2 Trump\uc2  administration.\par \par \uc2 ''How is Barack going to get past the Muslim ban?'' she asked.\par \par \uc2 She also spoke of the Statue of Liberty, recounting how for most Americans, the green lady of freedom represents a shining beacon of hope and a welcome symbol for immigrants arriving on the nation shores. But Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , she added with a glint of steel, ''looks at the Statue of Liberty and sees a 4'' -- a not-so-veiled reference to his comments rating the physical appearance of women.\par \par \uc2 ''Maybe a 5 if she loses the torch and tablet and changes her hair,'' she continued, before making an explicit, if subtle, pitch for becoming the nation's first female president.\par \par \uc2 ''You know, come to think, know what would be a good number for a woman? 45,'' she concluded triumphantly.\par \par \uc2 At the dinner before the remarks, the pair could be seen chatting, at least briefly, seated two seats apart, with only Cardinal \uc2 Timothy M. Dolan\uc2 , the archbishop of New York, between them. (Perhaps only a man of God could, for a night, soothe a campaign that has included an F.B.I. inquiry, overnight \uc2 Twitter\uc2  binges, multiple accusations of sexual misconduct and an international feud between the Republican nominee and Pope Francis).\par \par \uc2 Before the candidates spoke, Alfred E. Smith IV, the chairman of the dinner, which benefits Catholic charities, seemed to offer a preview of what may await Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  as he tries to return to New York society life should he not win the White House in November.\par \par \uc2 ''Before the dinner started, \uc2 Trump\uc2  went to Hillary and asked, 'How are you?''' Mr. Smith said, waiting a beat. ''She said, 'I'm fine -- now get out of the ladies' dressing room.'''\par \par \uc2 Even under the best of circumstances, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  is not known for an eagerness to laugh at himself. A veritable roasting at Washington's annual ''nerd prom,'' the \uc2 White House Correspondents' Association\uc2 's annual dinner, in 2011 may have hastened -- or even catalyzed -- his bid for the Oval Office. And now a flagging presidential campaign -- most polls place him several percentage points behind Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  nationally -- has done little to help.\par \par \uc2 Then there was the guest list. In addition to Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  was surrounded on the dais by assorted adversaries from his political and professional life. \uc2 Michael R. Bloomberg\uc2 , the billionaire former New York City mayor who has vocally opposed Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's bid, was perched in the first row, just in front of the candidates. And Eric T. Schneiderman, the New York attorney general, whose office has opened an investigation into Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's foundation, was positioned a safe distance away in the back.\par \par \uc2 At least one \uc2 Trump\uc2  ally, former Mayor \uc2 Rudolph W. Giuliani\uc2 , did attend what is, during even typical \uc2 election\uc2  seasons, a quintessentially New York event, packed with local political leaders and power brokers.\par \par \uc2 This year, it so happens that two New Yorkers can also be found at the top of the ballot.\par \par \uc2 One seemed to have more fun on Thursday than the other. Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  sat with his arms tightly folded as Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  spoke, a similarly taut smile across his face. But when Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  returned to one his favorite themes -- her health -- he seemed momentarily buoyed.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  said, had chivalrously sent a car to ferry her to the dinner. ''Actually, it was a hearse,'' she said.\par \par \uc2 Finally, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  laughed with real joy.\par \par \uc2 Find out what you need to know about the 2016 presidential race today, and get politics news updates via \uc2 Facebook\uc2 , \uc2 Twitter\uc2  and the First Draft newsletter.\par \par \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  and Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2  flanked Cardinal Timothy M. Dolan on Thursday night at the Alfred E. Smith Memorial Foundation Dinner, a charity event in Manhattan that is a traditional exercise in self-deprecation for presidential candidates.

\par\par \uc2 Politics; SECT\par \b \uc2 Debate Takeaways: \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  Had a Lot to Do, and He Didn't Do It\b0\par\par\uc2 By NICHOLAS CONFESSORE \par \uc2 818 \uc2 words\par \uc2 21 October 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 The New York Times on the Web\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Last chance, no backsies. The third and final presidential debate, held in Las Vegas on Wednesday night, was the last real chance for either \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  or \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2  to shift the momentum of the 2016 campaign. Wherever the race is now, it is highly likely to stay that way for the next 19 days. So what happened? Check out our takeaways.\par \par \uc2 Trump\uc2  took a chill pill\par \par \uc2 For much of the debate, viewers could -- sort of, if they squinted -- see the \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  that his advisers and coaches had been trying to summon since the spring. He was less impulsive. He interrupted less often. Gone was the thin-skinned, jittery counterpuncher of the first two showdowns, when Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  could not resist lashing out whenever Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  rolled a grenade down the hall. There were times when he even seemed to remember the facts and talking points he had evidently been drilled on: missing State Department funds, for example, and a \uc2 WikiLeaks\uc2  email in which a top \uc2 Clinton\uc2  adviser lamented her bad instincts.\par \par \uc2 He knows which voters he needs\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  seemed intent on stopping his bleeding among habitual Republican voters, whose support he needs to regain if he is to have even a slim hope of beating Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 . He spit out reasonably focused attacks on Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's support for the right to late-term abortion and promised to appoint conservative Supreme Court justices. For his own base of disenchanted working-class voters, there were riffs on the \uc2 North American Free Trade Agreement\uc2  and trade-related job losses. He promised tax cuts that would unleash prosperity for all -- standard Republican fare that may prove comforting to some who are wavering on his candidacy.\par \par \uc2 But so does \uc2 Clinton\par \par \uc2 Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  went to Las Vegas with a binder full of attacks on Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  and his treatment of women, all aimed at getting under his skin and reminding a crucial voting bloc of why it had abandoned him. While she was in Beijing defending women's rights as first lady in the 1990s, Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  said, he was calling Alicia Machado, a former Miss Universe, an ''eating machine.'' He said the women accusing him of sexual assault were too undesirable for him to have groped. ''He goes after their dignity, their self-worth,'' Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  said, ''and I don't think there's a woman anywhere who doesn't know what that feels like.'' Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  was left to protest lamely, and falsely, that the accusations against him had been widely debunked. Gender gap, meet gender chasm.\par \par \uc2 The chill pill didn't last\par \par \uc2 It didn't take long for the ''Saturday Night Live'' caricature to emerge: a harrumphing Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  muttering, ''Wrong,'' as Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  went on the attack; a virtually incomprehensible riff on Syria and the Islamic State that ended with Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  declaring that Aleppo, Syria's largest city before the war, had fallen to Russian and government troops (it hasn't). He whiffed on chances to hit Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  on Wall Street and pivot to allegations of sexual assault against her husband, former President \uc2 Bill \uc2 Clinton\uc2 . And toward the end of the debate, frustrated at Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's attacks on his tax avoidance, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  called her a ''nasty woman'' -- words that will most likely haunt him until \uc2 Election\uc2  Day and make it more difficult for him to recover the moderate female voters he needs to win.\par \par \uc2 One nonresponse could cost him\par \par \uc2 The moderator, Chris Wallace, pushed Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  on whether he would ''accept the result of this \uc2 election\uc2 ,'' a question that has raised hackles in recent days as Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  has floated unsubstantiated allegations of widespread voter fraud. It wasn't a well-framed query -- many candidates demand recounts or challenge initial results -- and a more agile debater might have pushed back. But when Mr. Wallace went further, asking whether the actual loser of the race should concede to the winner, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  left him hanging. ''What I'm saying is that I will tell you at the time,'' he said. ''I'll keep you in suspense. O.K.?'' That answer -- splashed on front pages and replayed on television -- is almost certain to pressure more Republicans into distancing themselves from him.\par \par \uc2 We're right where we were\par \par \uc2 It wasn't Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's best debate. It wasn't Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's worst. But he needed more than a split decision. With Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  well behind in virtually every swing state and hemorrhaging support, he needed to force Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  into a stumble while somehow rebooting perceptions of himself. It was a tall order. And Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  did not deliver.\par \par \uc2 Find out what you need to know about the 2016 presidential race today, and get politics news updates via \uc2 Facebook\uc2 , \uc2 Twitter\uc2  and the First Draft newsletter.\par \par \uc2 Document NYTF000020161021ecal0006o\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

Narrated by Neil deGrasse Tyson, the film explores mysterious dark matter and dark energy, and the ways scientists are working to improve their understanding of these phenomena. Every half-hour from 10:30 a.m. to 4 p.m. on weekdays, to 5 p.m. on weekends, Central Park West and 79th Street, 212-769-5200, amnh.org.\par \par \uc2 BROOKLYN HISTORICAL SOCIETY\uc2 : 'TRUMAN CAPOTE'S BROOKLYN: THE LOST PHOTOGRAPHS OF DAVID ATTIE' (continuing) Behind this new exhibition -- 40 photographs of Capote and Brooklyn Heights taken by David Attie in 1958 -- is the story of a son's rediscovery of his father's long-lost work. Mr. Attie died in 1982, when his sons were very young. One of them, the television writer Eli Attie, has spent the last few years exploring his father's archive for the first time; in the process he found photos his father had taken to accompany the Truman Capote essay ''A House on the Heights,'' which appeared in Holiday magazine in February 1959. Few of the photos were published, and the magazine included none of the Capote portraits. Now they are on view in an intimate show that feels like both a celebration of and an elegy for an unrefined Brooklyn that once earned the provocative opening line in Capote's essay: ''I live in Brooklyn. By choice.'' 128 Pierrepont Street, near \uc2 Clinton\uc2  Street, Brooklyn Heights, 718-222-4111, brooklynhistory.org.\par \par \uc2 INTREPID SEA, AIR & SPACE MUSEUM: 'ON THE LINE: INTREPID AND THE VIETNAM WAR' (through Oct. 2, 2017) Visitors familiar with this museum are likely to be well aware of its flight deck, perhaps even some of its wartime history. During the Vietnam War, the Intrepid served three tours overseas between 1966 and 1969. Now, in an exhibition set in the space where crew members lived and worked, the museum tells their stories with artifacts, film clips and photographs. Pier 86, 46th Street and 12th Avenue, \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , 877-957-7447, intrepidmuseum.org.\par \par \uc2 NEW YORK PUBLIC LIBRARY\uc2 : '\uc2 ALEXANDER HAMILTON\uc2 : STRIVER, STATESMAN, SCOUNDREL' (through Dec. 31) It's the New York Public Library's turn to take advantage of ''Hamilton''-mania. This exhibition, made from the library's collection, provides some answers to that question posed at the beginning of Lin-Manuel Miranda's hit musical about the ''founding father without a father,'' \uc2 Alexander Hamilton\uc2 : ''How does a bastard, orphan, son of a whore and a Scotsman, dropped in the middle of a forgotten spot in the Caribbean by providence, impoverished, in squalor, grow up to be a hero and a scholar?'' Stephen A. Schwarzman Building, New York Public Library, 917-275-6975, nypl.org/locations/schwarzman.\par \par \uc2 'SEE HOW THEY RAN! F.D.R. AND HIS OPPONENTS: CAMPAIGN TREASURES FROM THE \uc2 NEW-YORK HISTORICAL SOCIETY\uc2 ' (through Nov. 30) This \uc2 election\uc2  exhibition highlights the ''new media'' of Franklin D. Roosevelt's era. We have \uc2 Twitter\uc2  and Snapchat selfies; voters in the 1930s and '40s had campaign buttons and radio broadcasts. The show includes those political oldies, along with broadsides, popular music and posters, including one with a vivid original painting by the artist Ben Shahn. Roosevelt House Public Policy Institute at Hunter College, 47-49 East 65th Street, between Madison and Park Avenues, Upper East Side, 212-650-3174, roosevelthouse.hunter.cuny.edu; free.\par \par \uc2 Events\par \par \uc2 ARCHTOBER (through Oct. 31) Tours, talks, exhibitions -- it's difficult to keep track of all the events going on during New York's annual monthlong celebration of architecture and design. Each day features a building of the day, with a tour. Make reservations early; coveted tours sell out quickly. Among the options for the coming week is the Beaux-Arts landmark Gould Memorial Library, at Bronx Community College (Wednesday at noon). Other highlights include the panel discussion ''Authenticity and Innovation: The Inherent Value of Older Buildings,'' with the speakers Contantine Kontakosta, a professor at New York University; \uc2 Charles Bendit\uc2 , the co-chief executive of Taconic Investment Partners; and Claire Weisz, principal-in-charge at WXY architecture + urban design (Tuesday at 6 p.m., at the Center for Architecture, 536 LaGuardia Place in Greenwich Village). More information at archtober.org.\par \par \uc2 CIDER WEEK (Friday through Oct. 30) It's time to celebrate this seasonal specialty. Apple cider is pressed from a wide variety of apples, with flavor that reflects -- just like wine -- the land it came from. It is also tannic and can be sparkled. Learn more about craft cider, whose fans will tell you it's nothing like beer, in this citywide series of events and tastings. The lineup is at ciderweeknyc.com.\par \par \uc2 NYSCI AFTER DARK: HORROR SCIENCE (Saturday) The New York Hall of Science is primarily an educational playground for children, but for this series it stays open late for the 21+ crowd. October's edition comes with a Halloween twist: Activities include making costumes and prosthetic wounds, as well as demonstrations of blood cannons and special effects for onstage blood and guts. From 6 to 9 p.m., Flushing Meadows-Corona Park, 47-01 111th Street, Flushing Meadows-Corona Park, Queens, 718-699-0005, nysci.org.\par \par \uc2 TOMPKINS SQUARE HALLOWEEN DOG PARADE (Saturday) This costume contest is not for amateurs. Every year, hundreds of dogs and their owners dress up and compete for best in show -- and thousands of dollars in prizes. Costumes are often inspired by current events, and sometimes partnered outfits make for adorable, if absurd tableaus. (Picture a Chihuahua dressed as a chef, pretend-boiling another Chihuahua dressed as a lobster. It's happened.) If you don't have a dog or if you aren't feeling competitive, no need to worry: After the judging, all the contestants will strut their stuff in a parade. From noon to 3 p.m., Tompkins Square Park, Avenue A to Avenue B, and Seventh Street to 10th Street, East Village, tompkinssquaredogrun.com.\par \par \uc2 Spoken Word\par \par \uc2 ABBI JACOBSON (Tuesday) On ''Broad City,'' the comedy series Ms. Jacobson created and stars in with Ilana Glazer, she plays a fictional version of herself. But like her television alter ego, Ms. Jacobson is a visual artist. In this talk, she shares ''Carry This Book,'' her collection of illustrations of everyday objects we carry with us. Oprah's favorite purse makes an appearance, as does Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2 's weekend bag. (Spoiler: It contains a lot of self-tanning lotion.) Ms. Jacobson will be joined by Lena Dunham, the creator of ''Girls'' and author of ''Not That Kind of Girl.'' At 7:30 p.m., Strand Book Store, 828 Broadway, at 12th Street, 212-473-1452, strandbooks.com.\par \par \uc2 THE MAKING OF THE PRESIDENTS (Tuesday) Biographers of recent American presidents gather for this talk about the current \uc2 election\uc2  season and the state of political commentary. The speakers include David Remnick, editor of The New Yorker and author of ''The Bridge: The Life and Rise of \uc2 Barack Obama\uc2 ''; Jacob Weisberg, author of ''Ronald Reagan''; \uc2 David Maraniss\uc2 , author of ''First in His Class: A Biography of \uc2 Bill \uc2 Clinton\uc2 ''; and Jonathan Alter, an NBC News journalist who is currently at work on a biography of \uc2 Jimmy Carter\uc2 . Lesley Stahl, a correspondent for CBS's ''60 Minutes,'' will moderate. At 6:30 p.m., Greenberg Lounge, N.Y.U. School of Law, 40 Washington Square South, between Macdougal and Sullivan Streets, Greenwich Village, eventbrite.com.\par \par \uc2 NATIONAL CONVERSATION ON RIGHTS AND JUSTICE: WOMEN'S RIGHTS AND GENDER EQUALITY (Friday) This series of talks and spoken-word performances, presented by the \uc2 National Archives and Records Administration\uc2 , covers a wide range of the history and state of women's rights -- including health, work and education issues. Speakers include Soledad O'Brien, the broadcast journalist and leader of Starfish Media Group, and \uc2 Melissa Mark-Viverito\uc2 , speaker of the New York City Council. More information at archivesfoundation.org. From 9 a.m. to 4 p.m., United States Custom House, 1 Bowling Green, Lower Manhattan.\par \par \uc2 OPERA IN POP CULTURE (Monday) Regardless of whether you know the whole operas, you could probably recall the overture to Rossini's ''Guillaume Tell'' or the ''Flight of the Valkyries'' from Wagner's ''Die Walk\u252\'00\'FCre.'' These musical moments that transcend opera are the subject of a three-part series of talks hosted by the Metropolitan Opera Guild and led by William Berger, the author and co-host of the Met's radio broadcasts. It concludes on Monday with ''Opera in Film.'' At 5:30 p.m., Opera Learning Center, Samuel B. and David Rose Building at Lincoln Center, 65th Street, between Broadway and Amsterdam Avenue, Upper West Side, 212-769-7028, metguild.org.\par \par \uc2 'WELCOME TO THE UNIVERSE' (Wednesday) Once upon a time at \uc2 Princeton University\uc2 , the astrophysicists Neil deGrasse Tyson, Michael A. Strauss, and J. Richard Gott taught a popular astronomy course that doubled as a broad tour of the cosmos. The class inspired the book ''Welcome to the Universe,'' recently published by \uc2 Princeton University\uc2  Press. To celebrate, the authors are getting together to discuss astronomy and what fascinates them: planets, black holes and even time travel. At 7 p.m., \uc2 American Museum of Natural History\uc2 , Central Park West and 79th Street, 212-769-5200, amnh.org.\par \par \uc2 Walking Tours\par \par \uc2 BROADWAY UP CLOSE: 'ACT I' (daily) Broadway Up Close's flagship tour takes participants through the history of Manhattan's theater district, from its origins in the 1880s to this season's hits. Highlights include 42nd Street itself, ghost stories and theaters where history was made -- including the Nederlander, where the tour begins and where the musical ''Rent'' introduced changes (like ticket lotteries) that remain popular today. At 11 a.m., beginning at 208 West 41st Street, Manhattan, 917-841-0187, broadwayupclose.com. Reservations are required.\par \par \uc2 CANDLELIGHT GHOST TOURS (through Oct. 30) The Merchant's House Museum -- where eight members of the Tredwell family lived and, more important, died -- opens its doors for tours and tales of ghost sightings, disembodied voices and other supernatural events. At various times; the schedule is at merchantshouse.org. At 4 p.m. on Sunday, the museum also hosts a re-enactment of a 19th-century funeral and graveyard procession. In 1865, the house's owner, Seabury Tredwell, died at the home; his funeral begins in the museum's double parlor and continues at the nearby New York Marble Cemetery, which is rarely open. 29 East Fourth Street, East Village, 212-777-1089.\par \par \uc2 (PHOTOGRAPHS BY JASON DeCROW/INVISION FOR PURINA BEGGIN'/ASSOCIATED PRESS; ''PURINA BEGGIN") \par \par \uc2 Document NYTF000020161021ecal0006h\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 National Desk; SECTA\par \b \uc2 Widening Attack on G.O.P., Obama Targets Rubio in Florida\b0\par\par\uc2 By MARK LANDLER and JULIE HIRSCHFELD DAVIS; Mark Landler reported from Miami Gardens, and Julie Hirschfeld Davis from Phoenix. \par \uc2 1,161 \uc2 words\par \uc2 21 October 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 18\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 MIAMI GARDENS, Fla. -- President Obama joined a parade of Democrats on Thursday in rebuking \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2  for threatening not to abide by the results of the \uc2 election\uc2 . But he saved his thorniest barbs for Senator \uc2 Marco Rubio\uc2 , the Florida Republican who endorsed Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  after labeling him a ''dangerous con artist'' during their bitter primary battle.\par \par \uc2 ''How can he call him a con artist and dangerous, and object to all the controversial things he's said, but then say, 'I'm still going to vote for him?''' Mr. Obama said to a boisterous crowd at a \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  rally at a historically black college in this swing state.\par \par \uc2 ''C'mon, man,'' he said.\par \par \uc2 ''That is the sign of someone who will say anything, do anything, pretend to be anybody just to get elected,'' said Mr. Obama, as he praised Representative Patrick Murphy, who is waging an uphill battle to unseat Mr. Rubio. ''If you're willing to be anybody just to be somebody, man, you don't have the leadership that Florida needs in the \uc2 United States Senate\uc2 .''\par \par \uc2 Mr. Obama's assault on Mr. Rubio showcased the president's determination to broaden his indictment of Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  into an indictment of the Republican Party, parts of which continue to support the nominee, even after a calamitous few weeks in which he was heard speaking about women in crudely sexual terms in a 2005 recording and then declared in his debate with Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  on Wednesday that he might not accept the voters' verdict on \uc2 Election\uc2  Day.\par \par \uc2 Speaking to a crowd of 2,800 at Florida Memorial University, in a tone that was sarcastic even by his sardonic standards, Mr. Obama asked how Republicans could stand by a candidate who called women pigs; threatened to silence reporters, jail his opponent, and expel Muslims from the country; and cozied up to the autocratic leader of Russia.\par \par \uc2 ''If you've made a career of idolizing Ronald Reagan,'' he said, ''then where were you when your party's nominee for president was kissing up to \uc2 Vladimir Putin\uc2 , the former K.G.B. officer.''\par \par \uc2 ''I agree with the U.S. senator, a Republican, who a while back said that we cannot afford to give the nuclear codes of the United States to an erratic individual,'' Mr. Obama said. ''By the way, you know who said that?'' he added, pausing for his punch line, ''\uc2 Marco Rubio\uc2 .''\par \par \uc2 Mr. Obama repeated his criticism of Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  for suggesting that he would dispute the results of the \uc2 election\uc2  if he lost. After lampooning his assertion of widespread voter fraud -- and questioning whether he had ever visited a polling place -- the president struck a serious note.\par \par \uc2 ''That's not a joking matter,'' he said. ''That is dangerous. When you try to sow the seeds of doubt in people's minds about the legitimacy of our elections, that undermines our democracy.''\par \par \uc2 The president's wife, Michelle, speaking in Phoenix on Thursday, made a passionate case against Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , portraying him as a bigoted elitist out of touch with the concerns of ordinary people and untethered from the values that undergird American democracy.\par \par \uc2 Making a direct appeal to Republicans and independent voters in a traditionally right-leaning state, Mrs. Obama contrasted Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's privileged upbringing with the middle-class roots she and Mr. Obama share with Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , arguing that he lacks the empathy to lead the country.\par \par \uc2 ''Perhaps living life high up in a tower in a world of exclusive clubs, measuring success by wins and losses, the number of zeros in your bank account, perhaps you just develop a different set of values,'' Mrs. Obama said, drawing boos and hisses from a crowd of 7,000 in a convention center downtown, as she referred to Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  without naming him.\par \par \uc2 ''Maybe with so little exposure to people who are different than you, it becomes easy to take advantage of those who are down on their luck, folks who play by the rules, pay what they owe, because to you, those folks just aren't very smart and seem somehow less deserving.''\par \par \uc2 Mrs. Obama denounced Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  for suggesting that he might not accept the outcome of the \uc2 election\uc2 , urging voters to recognize it as an effort to discourage them from casting ballots and to reject it forcefully.\par \par \uc2 ''When a presidential candidate threatens to ignore our voices and reject the outcome of this \uc2 election\uc2 , he is threatening the very idea of America itself, and we cannot stand for that,'' she said.\par \par \uc2 ''You do not keep American democracy 'in suspense,''' Mrs. Obama added, seeking to turn Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's equivocating words in Wednesday's debate against him.\par \par \uc2 Mrs. Obama's appearance in Phoenix underlined a remarkable turn in the race, as Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  presses to widen her growing advantage over Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  and use it to help down-ballot Democrats in areas normally considered out of their reach.\par \par \uc2 Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's decision to deploy Mrs. Obama, perhaps her most potent surrogate, was the latest evidence that her campaign believes that Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's vulnerability could sweep Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  to victory in Republican-leaning states, carrying a broader slate of Democrats into Congress along with her.\par \par \uc2 Mrs. Obama's speech on Thursday was a far broader indictment of Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  than her remarks last week in New Hampshire, when she spoke in deeply personal terms about Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's demeaning remarks about women.\par \par \uc2 She said that speech, a striking moment in the campaign, had sparked an outpouring of letters and emails to her office. ''Here's what I'm asking,'' Mrs. Obama said. ''If you liked that speech, then go vote.''\par \par \uc2 In Florida, her husband mixed campaigning for Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  with a defense of his marquee legislative accomplishment, the Affordable Care Act. Speaking earlier, at Miami Dade College, Mr. Obama hailed the law's progress in enrolling people in health insurance plans, even as he conceded there were flaws in the program.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Obama said he hoped the next president, working with Congress, would undertake the repair work. With him no longer in the picture, he mused, Republicans might be more willing to collaborate -- and he said he would be fine with them taking credit for it.\par \par \uc2 ''They can even change the name of the law to ReaganCare. Or they can call it \uc2 Paul Ryan\uc2  Care,'' he said. ''I don't care.''\par \par \uc2 Follow The \uc2 New York Times\uc2 's politics and Washington coverage on \uc2 Facebook\uc2  and \uc2 Twitter\uc2 , and sign up for the First Draft politics newsletter.\par \par \uc2 President Obama campaigning for Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  at Florida Memorial University, where he praised Patrick Murphy, who is trying to unseat Senator Marco Rubio.; Mr. Obama called Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's assertions of widespread voter fraud ''dangerous.''

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 The fiery final presidential debate between \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  and \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2  drew 71.6 million viewers, the third-highest total ever for a presidential debate, according to data from Nielsen released on Thursday.\par \par \uc2 The debate did not approach the record-setting first debate on Sept. 26, which had 84 million viewers, but it did surpass the second debate audience of 66.5 million.\par \par \uc2 By this point, record ratings have become a familiar story line for this year's \uc2 election\uc2  cycle. Wednesday night closed out a 14-month debate season that featured two dozen debates, many of which set records, including:\par \par \uc2 \u226\'00\'E2\u8211\'20\'13\u160\'00\'A0 The most-viewed debate ever (the first presidential debate).\par \par \uc2 \u226\'00\'E2\u8211\'20\'13\u160\'00\'A0 The highest-rated primary debate and the highest-rated non-sports cable event ever (the first Republican debate, which drew 24 million viewers in August 2015).\par \par \uc2 \u226\'00\'E2\u8211\'20\'13\u160\'00\'A0 The highest-rated Democratic debate ever (the first Democratic debate in October 2015 had 15.8 million viewers).\par \par \uc2 Chris Wallace of Fox News moderated Wednesday's debate and received something that's been elusive this \uc2 election\uc2  cycle for moderators: nearly universal praise.\par \par \uc2 One of Mr. Wallace's questions provided the day's biggest headline. When Mr. Wallace pressed Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  on whether he would unequivocally accept the \uc2 election\uc2  results, he refused to say he would. ''I will keep you in suspense,'' he said.\par \par \uc2 Unlike the first two presidential debates, Wednesday's debate did not go head-to-head against a \uc2 National Football League\uc2  game, though it did have competition from Game 4 of the National League Championship Series (The second debate on Oct. 9 ran opposite ''Sunday Night Football,'' so \uc2 NBC\uc2  did not broadcast the debate at all).\par \par \uc2 Fox News had the highest ratings of any network on Wednesday, 11.3 million, besting ABC's 11 million, which ranked second. The ratings did not include streaming statistics or \uc2 C-Span\uc2 , so the total audience was most likely quite a bit larger.\par \par \uc2 The second most-viewed debate ever, the 1980 debate between Ronald Reagan and Jimmy Carter, had 80.6 million viewers.\par \par \uc2 This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.\par \par \uc2 Document NYTF000020161021ecal00062\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

SANGER \par \uc2 1,206 \uc2 words\par \uc2 21 October 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 1\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 WASHINGTON -- \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  made it abundantly clear Wednesday night that if she defeats \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2  next month she will enter the White House with the most contentious relationship with Russia of any president in more than three decades, and with a visceral, personal animus toward \uc2 Vladimir V. Putin\uc2 , its leader.\par \par \uc2 ''We haven't seen a you-can't-trust-these-guys tone like this since the days of Ronald Reagan,'' said Stephen Sestanovich, who served in President \uc2 Bill \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's State Department and is the author of ''Maximalist: America in the World from Truman to Obama.'' ''But even that was more a systemic criticism of the Soviet Union. This is focused on Putin himself.''\par \par \uc2 In a reversal of political roles, Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , the Democratic candidate, is the one portraying Mr. Putin as America's newest archenemy, whose underlings hack into her Brooklyn campaign headquarters, bomb Syrian civilians and threaten Ukraine and \uc2 NATO\uc2  allies in Europe. For a woman who presented a big red ''reset'' button to her Russian counterpart in March 2009 (with the word incorrectly translated into Russian), the change in tone was more striking than ever in her debate with \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 She, and the Obama White House, insist they were on the right course until Mr. Putin decided he had more to gain from reviving Cold War tensions than from a quarter-century effort to integrate with the West. Now, much of the Democratic foreign policy establishment has become as hawkish as Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  on the subject of Russia, a view that seems almost certain to outlast the campaign.\par \par \uc2 Privately, some of her longtime advisers are already thinking about what mix of sanctions, diplomatic isolation and international condemnation they might put together if they take office to deal with Mr. Putin and the fragile economic state he runs, an update of the ''containment'' strategy that George F. Kennan formulated for President Harry S. Truman in 1947.\par \par \uc2 Equally surprising is the Republican reversal of tone. Only four years ago, it was the Republican presidential nominee, \uc2 Mitt Romney\uc2 , who was warning of the dangers of a revanchist Russia and President Obama who said ''the 1980s are now calling to ask for their foreign policy back,'' noting that ''the Cold War's been over for 20 years.''\par \par \uc2 Most of the Republican Party remains firmly distrustful of Russia. But not Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , its standard-bearer.\par \par \uc2 ''If the United States got along with Russia, wouldn't be so bad,'' he said Wednesday, uttering not a word about Mr. Putin's land grabs. Instead, he urged viewers to ''take a look at the 'Start Up' they signed,'' apparently confusing the lingo of Silicon Valley with New START, the 2010 arms control treaty. The problem, he said, is that Russia is outbuilding the United States' nuclear arsenal -- it is not, at least so far, because of the treaty's limits. The debate then devolved into an argument over which candidate was Putin's puppet.\par \par \uc2 Time after time, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  has insisted, as he did during Wednesday's debate, that the United States has ''no idea'' who was behind the hacking of the \uc2 Democratic National Committee\uc2  and Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's aides. ''Putin has outsmarted her and Obama at every single step of the way,'' he argued, from Syria to the development of new missiles.\par \par \uc2 For days, hacked emails from the Gmail account of \uc2 John D. Podesta\uc2 , Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's campaign chairman, have embarrassed her campaign, and on Thursday, emails from an account Mr. Obama had during his 2008 transition surfaced for the first time. No one knows if the hacking campaign is winding down or whether the revelations so far are simply a prelude to something bigger between now and \uc2 Election\uc2  Day.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Obama is considering retaliation that, according to several senior officials, could include attacks inside Russia that could expose corruption among the leadership and embarrass Mr. Putin. It is not clear whether Mr. Obama will choose that route, even after Vice President \uc2 Joseph R. Biden Jr\uc2 . issued a threat last weekend that Mr. Putin could get some of his own medicine.\par \par \uc2 But it is clear that if Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  wins, she will enter the White House with a very personal grudge against Mr. Putin. He, in turn, has long harbored a grudge against her for her statements in 2011 calling into question the validity of a Russian parliamentary \uc2 election\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 It is possible, Mr. Sestanovich warned, that Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  and the Obama administration are seeing Mr. Putin's direct hand in too many events. He questioned how the director of national intelligence, James R. Clapper Jr., would know for certain that the Kremlin leadership was behind the hacking of the \uc2 Democratic National Committee\uc2  and the emails of Mr. Podesta and Colin L. Powell, one of Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's predecessors as secretary of state. The United States has released none of its evidence, so it is unclear if the conclusion was based on an educated guess about Kremlin operations, an ''implant'' in Russian networks, or a human spy or communications intercept.\par \par \uc2 But it is clear, Mr. Sestanovich said, that Mr. Putin is using this moment of leadership transition to press for any advantage, with methods such as using information warfare techniques on American soil, intimidating Ukraine, and running major military exercises on the border with Norway.\par \par \uc2 Not surprisingly, some Democrats on the left find all this a bit unnerving. ''That reckless branding of \uc2 Trump\uc2  as a Russian agent, most of it is coming from the \uc2 Clinton\uc2  campaign,'' \uc2 Stephen F. Cohen\uc2 , a professor emeritus at \uc2 New York University\uc2  and Princeton, told \uc2 CNN\uc2  in an interview over the summer. ''And they really need to stop.''\par \par \uc2 In fact, many in the Democratic Party have spent decades invested in bringing Moscow into the Western fold, dating to the days when President \uc2 Bill \uc2 Clinton\uc2  first met with Boris Yeltsin, then the Russian president, and began the process of expanding the Group of 7 industrialized countries to the Group of 8. They also began the long process of bringing Russia into the \uc2 World Trade Organization\uc2 , an effort to wrap the country in Western-created rules. The nuclear arsenals on both sides shrank by more than 80 percent, to 1,550 deployed warheads on each side under New START, which Mr. Obama negotiated in his first year in office.\par \par \uc2 The treaty remains in effect. But there are arguments over new weapons, and a major program to dispose of military stockpiles of plutonium was halted this month by Mr. Putin, citing the deterioration of relations with the United States.\par \par \uc2 And it is Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  who says he can reverse all that, with good negotiations, if he is president.\par \par \uc2 ''I think I could see myself meeting with Putin and meeting with Russia prior to the start of the administration,'' he said in an interview with Michael Savage, the talk show host, this week. ''I think it would be wonderful.''\par \par \uc2 Find out what you need to know about the 2016 presidential race today, and get politics news updates via \uc2 Facebook\uc2 , \uc2 Twitter\uc2  and the First Draft newsletter.\par \par \uc2 Vladimir V. Putin has a grudge against Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  to match the one she has against him.

\par\par \uc2 National Desk; SECTA\par \b \uc2 He's a Spanish-Language Soap Star. Why Was He Moonlighting?\b0\par\par\uc2 By LIZETTE ALVAREZ \par \uc2 1,391 \uc2 words\par \uc2 21 October 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 1\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 MIAMI -- It was a scene right out of a juicy telenovela, one of those Spanish-language soap operas that unfold one betrayal and love affair at a time on television screens all over the world.\par \par \uc2 Pablo Azar, the green-eyed Mexican telenovela star, stepped out of a limousine and walked down the red carpet at an awards show here last year amid the usual celebrity mayhem. Cameras flashed. Fans shouted. Mr. Azar, 34, smiled broadly and walked inside.\par \par \uc2 But after the awards show, Mr. Azar did something his army of admirers would never have imagined: He changed out of his suit, climbed behind the wheel of his car and started his shift as an Uber driver, a job he relies on when he's between acting gigs to pay his bills.\par \par \uc2 ''At first, I was ashamed of this,'' Mr. Azar, a Miami-based actor who is often recognized by telenovela lovers here and abroad, said from the Wynwood studio where he also paints and sells his art. ''Our fans from Latin America who watch novelas, they think we are millionaires and that we drive Ferraris and live in Beverly Hills.''\par \par \uc2 Despite their devoted worldwide following, Mr. Azar and many other working novela actors who shoot their shows in Miami struggle to make ends meet between jobs. This is not because they work for a foreign company: The novelas are produced by \uc2 Telemundo\uc2 , a Spanish-language network owned by NBCUniversal and based in Miami (\uc2 Univision\uc2 , its rival, imports nearly all its novelas from \uc2 Televisa\uc2 , a Mexican company).\par \par \uc2 And it is not because \uc2 Telemundo\uc2 , once an underdog, is financially ailing: Its ratings have climbed so high that this summer it billed itself as the fourth major network, and it now routinely beats \uc2 Univision\uc2  with the coveted 18-to-49-year-old viewers in prime time during the week. What's more, telenovelas are blockbusters for Spanish-language network television.\par \par \uc2 The difference is this: \uc2 Telemundo\uc2 's television shows are produced in Spanish, not English, making it easier for the network to argue that the shows are different from others produced in the United States. As a result, it has been easier for \uc2 Telemundo\uc2  to sidestep the pressure from the television industry's union, SAG-Aftra, which is pushing the network to come to an agreement.\par \par \uc2 In fact, \uc2 Telemundo\uc2  is the only large network in the United States that hires professional actors, but does not produce its shows under union contracts. \uc2 Telemundo\uc2  actors say their pay is generally not as high as their counterparts in American soap operas.\par \par \uc2 Now it is facing a push by many of its actors to work under the protection of the union at a time when \uc2 Telemundo\uc2  is reimagining telenovelas -- a kissing cousin, so to speak, of the American soap opera, only on steroids. Unlike American soaps, which have run for decades, the novelas often stay on the air for only a year or two, or on \uc2 Telemundo\uc2  a little longer if they are successful.\par \par \uc2 Telemundo\uc2  has shaken up the telenovela by making it hipper, edgier and more diverse. It sets some of them in cities like Chicago, Miami, and Los Angeles -- not just places in Latin America -- and plumbs the worlds of drug cartels (they call these shows narco novelas), border crossers, immigrant families and truck-driving empires.\par \par \uc2 This has attracted more men and younger audiences in the United States and elsewhere, including the recently captured Mexican drug kingpin known as El Chapo, Joaqu\u237\'00\'EDn Guzm\u225\'00\'E1n Loera. He was so enamored of ''Reina del Sur'' -- ''Queen of the South'' -- that he secretly met with its star, Kate del Castillo, who played a powerful drug kingpin.\par \par \uc2 Another occasional telenovela face was Alicia Machado, the former Miss Universe who was derided by Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2  as being overweight. Ms. Machado worked mostly for \uc2 Telemundo\uc2 's rivals, including \uc2 Televisa\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 One thing that has not wavered is the overwrought nature of the novela -- characters cavort and scheme; sisters betray one another; husbands philander; wives yearn for younger men; men and women overcome cancer, violence, amnesia, soul transmigrations, miscarriages, greed, corruption, baby switches and false imprisonments (sometimes in one season). Syrupy music is pivotal. Weeping is essential. Love scenes are inescapable.\par \par \uc2 But unlike American soap operas, whose viewership has plummeted in recent years, telenovelas remain immensely popular. And unlike American soap opera actors (or most any television actor) in the United States, the \uc2 Telemundo\uc2  actors in Miami, most of whom are legal United States residents or citizens, do not work under union protection.\par \par \uc2 This means they do not get health insurance, residuals for reruns or the sizable international market, or coverage for accidents on the set, which are far from uncommon. There is also no set minimum-wage guarantee, although that tends not to be as great a problem.\par \par \uc2 Some of them already belong to SAG-Aftra because they have worked on English-language shows. But once they utter ''te quiero'' instead of ''I love you,'' their union protection -- along with residuals and health insurance -- goes out the door.\par \par \uc2 ''It's a double standard,'' said Steve Sidawi, the union's national director for organizing. ''This is something that is fundamentally a social justice issue for us.''\par \par \uc2 Some \uc2 Telemundo\uc2  actors who work in Miami are pledging to sign union cards and vote in a union \uc2 election\uc2 , if given the chance. They said that the lack of union protection for them in Miami, where \uc2 Telemundo\uc2  is building a large $250 million facility, defies common sense in an industry where the next job is always a hustle and schedules can be grueling.\par \par \uc2 In a statement, \uc2 Telemundo\uc2  said that its performers were free to join the union and that SAG-Aftra could organize a secret ballot to have them do so, a process established by the \uc2 National Labor Relations Board\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 ''We remain committed to making \uc2 Telemundo\uc2  a great place to work for our employees and continue to invest in them to ensure their salaries and working conditions are competitive,'' said Alfredo Richard, the senior vice president for NBCUniversal Telemundo Enterprises, adding that the network had created hundreds of jobs in Miami.\par \par \uc2 Telemundo\uc2  also offers ''exclusive'' contracts to a few of its biggest stars, which gives them more generous benefits and longer-term contracts with the network.\par \par \uc2 But Mr. Sidawi said a much faster way forward would be for the company to meet with union officials and come to an agreement on union membership. Even an \uc2 election\uc2  requires negotiation on who would be eligible to vote since \uc2 Telemundo\uc2  actors come and go, work short-term contracts and are scattered around Latin American and the United States, he said.\par \par \uc2 Working with unions is nothing new for Spanish-language actors, or \uc2 Telemundo\uc2 . When the network shoots a novela in Mexico, where \uc2 Telemundo\uc2  sometimes goes on location, the actors are covered by an actors' union there. The same is true in several other Latin American countries.\par \par \uc2 ''In telenovelas, they can kill your character off in the middle of the shoot and you are paid that day, and it's over,'' said Katie Barberi, 44, a member of SAG-Aftra who has appeared in 20 telenovelas, including most recently ''Eva la Trailera'' -- ''Eva the Truck Driver.'' ''It isn't guaranteed on any level.''\par \par \uc2 Actors everywhere struggle to find work in a fiercely competitive field. But what is unusual is that many novela actors are famous, with an enormous and devoted fan base around the world. Ms. Barberi, for example, has a jewelry line, Mariposa Katie, which carries the nickname of her ''Do\u241\'00\'F1a B\u225\'00\'E1rbara'' character.\par \par \uc2 Between acting jobs, though, some of these actors in Miami are selling real estate, designing T-shirts, driving for Uber or heading back to Latin America where working conditions are better. Mr. Azar said it is a slice of their personal lives that actors seldom divulge; they do not want their fans to know.\par \par \uc2 ''They don't want people to see our real lives,'' said Mr. Azar, who is now working on a new novela called ''La Fan.'' ''It breaks the dream.''\par \par \uc2 Pablo Azar, who regularly works on soap operas on the Spanish-language Telemundo network.

\par\par \uc2 National Desk; SECTA\par \b \uc2 Trump\uc2 's Defiance Is Seen as Threat to U.S. Image\b0\par\par\uc2 By ALEXANDER BURNS; Somini Sengupta contributed reporting. \par \uc2 1,175 \uc2 words\par \uc2 21 October 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 16\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 It is a scene reminiscent of other countries and other times: An angry candidate defies the will of the voters and hurls venom at the democratic process. Threats of jail are issued against political opponents. There is even loose talk of armed insurrection.\par \par \uc2 With his assault on the legitimacy of the presidential \uc2 election\uc2 , \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2  threatens to touch off a humiliating spectacle unseen in the United States since the country became a global power.\par \par \uc2 Diplomats and elected officials in both parties fear that Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , if he loses, will inflict grave trauma on the electorate and severely undermine the international reputation of an American political system known for revering the peaceful transfer of power.\par \par \uc2 Though he trails \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  by a wide margin in most polls and has been abandoned by much of his own party, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  still commands a powerful bully pulpit that he may use to amplify his unsupported claims that American democracy is a fraudulent system.\par \par \uc2 Nicholas Burns, a former undersecretary of state under George W. Bush, said Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's refusal to say he would respect the outcome of the presidential race was a ''colossal mistake'' that could damage American prestige abroad.\par \par \uc2 ''What many if not most foreigners admire about us, about the United States, is the durability of our democracy and the fact that we alternate power,'' Mr. Burns said. ''It's how we are fundamentally different from Russia and China, and it gives us an enormous advantage.''\par \par \uc2 Mr. Burns, who has endorsed Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  for president, called Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's remarks a flagrant violation of American democratic traditions. ''I don't think we've had a serious national leader say that since the Confederate leaders of 1860 who refused to accept the \uc2 election\uc2  of Lincoln,'' he said.\par \par \uc2 William M. Daley, a former White House chief of staff who was the chairman of Al Gore's campaign during the 2000 standoff in Florida, said Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  seemed indifferent to the possibility that his words might weaken trust in the American government, at home and overseas.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Daley said the Gore team had been cautious not to say anything during the Florida recount that might cripple the next president's legitimacy, to the point that other Democrats criticized them for being overly cautious. Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , he said, was taking the opposite approach.\par \par \uc2 ''He really has no appreciation for our history, which most of the world looks at with great admiration, as opposed to some banana republic,'' Mr. Daley said. On \uc2 election\uc2  night, Mr. Daley said, ''he could be tweeting at 3 in the morning and trying to undercut the new administration coming in.''\par \par \uc2 The United States has endured contested \uc2 election\uc2  results, most recently in 2000, but historians and political experts could recall no case of a presidential nominee attacking the electoral process, with no apparent instigation or factual basis, with weeks until \uc2 Election\uc2  Day, as Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  is doing now.\par \par \uc2 It is unclear whether Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  has a concrete plan to contest the results of the \uc2 election\uc2  if he loses. There is no law that forces a losing candidate to concede defeat -- only a bipartisan tradition of comity. But fighting the apparent outcome of a presidential race could require elaborate litigation across numerous states, with virtually no hope of success without hard evidence of extensive fraud.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  has presented no such evidence, instead offering sweeping denunciations of the overall political process, the news media and the judicial system. His language has seemed to conjure images from the developing world and unsteady new democracies -- countries like Myanmar and Nigeria, where governments have overturned \uc2 election\uc2  results by fiat, and political turbulence has given rise to outbreaks of violence.\par \par \uc2 In the United States, modern presidential standoffs have been tense but restrained: Mr. Gore mounted an aggressive legal challenge to \uc2 election\uc2  results in Florida, but he conceded swiftly once the Supreme Court ruled against him. When John F. Kennedy narrowly defeated Richard M. Nixon in 1960, Nixon publicly renounced his claim to the presidency even as his supporters pressed forward with recounts on the state level.\par \par \uc2 Only a few presidential elections, with painfully inconclusive results, have yielded more turbulent challenges after \uc2 Election\uc2  Day. Two 19th-century presidents who failed to win the popular vote, John Quincy Adams and Rutherford B. Hayes, entered office battered by opponents who said they had won through corrupt means. Neither man served a second term.\par \par \uc2 In American electoral history, there is only one instance of the losing side in an \uc2 election\uc2  simply declining to abide by the outcome, without any substantive legal objection or mathematical uncertainty around the results. That was in 1860, when Abraham Lincoln's \uc2 election\uc2  prompted the secession of Southern states that refused to tolerate his opposition to slavery.\par \par \uc2 Despite the heated passions of Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's political following, he appears unlikely to steer the country into civil war. Still, he has unnerved many American political leaders through what they view as his sheer recklessness.\par \par \uc2 Benjamin L. Ginsberg\uc2 , a prominent Republican \uc2 election\uc2  lawyer who represented Mr. Bush against Mr. Gore in their 2000 impasse, said Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  was taking the country into unknown territory.\par \par \uc2 ''When people see a close \uc2 election\uc2  and exert their rights to the fullest is what we have always considered within bounds,'' Mr. Ginsberg said. ''But saying somehow that our elections are not going to be accurate and do not adequately convey the will of the majority is different from what we have ever seen before.''\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's campaign has long attracted unusual interest, and in some cases extraordinary alarm, in foreign countries. Several foreign leaders have intervened in the American \uc2 election\uc2  to attack his candidacy in strikingly blunt terms; \uc2 Manuel Valls\uc2 , the prime minister of France, declared flatly this month that his country supported Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  has also been endorsed by an array of hard-right leaders across Europe, and he has campaigned alongside Nigel Farage, the nationalist politician who led the charge for Britain to leave the \uc2 European Union\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's attack on the American electoral system quickly stirred reaction from activists preoccupied with matters of international democracy and freedom. On \uc2 Facebook\uc2 , Shen Tong, a former leader of the Chinese pro-democracy movement who organized protests in Tiananmen Square, wrote that Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's comments had been jarring for anyone who expected an easy ''national \uc2 election\uc2  and peaceful transition of power in the USA every 4 years.''\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's ''suspense on his acceptance of the \uc2 election\uc2  result reminds me how unique this constitutional democracy has been,'' Mr. Shen wrote, ''and how much we've taken it for granted.''\par \par \uc2 Find out what you need to know about the 2016 presidential race today, and get politics news updates via \uc2 Facebook\uc2 , \uc2 Twitter\uc2  and the First Draft newsletter.\par \par \uc2 An early-voting site this week in Chicago.

\par\par \uc2 Politics; SECT\par \b \uc2 The Debate That Wasn't: So Many Words, So Few About Policy\b0\par\par\uc2 By ALAN RAPPEPORT \par \uc2 1,100 \uc2 words\par \uc2 21 October 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 The New York Times on the Web\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 The three presidential debates had no shortage of discussion about groping, beauty queens and \uc2 Twitter\uc2  habits. A question on energy policy this month was memorable only because it gave rise to a meme about the red sweater sported by the voter, Ken Bone, who asked it. Even on Wednesday, when the moderator made policy a priority, the discussion between \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2  and \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  remained skin deep.\par \par \uc2 Lost in the bluster and bombast has been the kind of detailed policy talk that traditionally consumes candidates this time of year. While onstage stalking and shimmying kept body-language experts busy, many who care about tax policy, immigration, health care and climate change were left with little to chew on.\par \par \uc2 Undecided voters curious where the candidates stood on American relations with Israel or their views on the Keystone XL oil pipeline were left to look elsewhere. But even the subjects that did come up didn't result in robust discussions of how the nation's most pressing problems should be solved.\par \par \uc2 Following are some of the issues that got short shrift.\par \par \uc2 Taxes\par \par \uc2 Debate audiences have heard much jousting over how little Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  has paid in income taxes, but far less about how much voters will have to pay if he or Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  is elected.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  accused her of wanting a big tax increase; Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  said his tax plan would send the country spinning into a recession. A minor tussle about the future of ''carried interest'' was pretty much it: more finger food than main course.\par \par \uc2 ''It's been largely lacking,'' said Grover Norquist, president of Americans for Tax Reform. ''He says, 'I want to cut taxes, she wants to raise them.' They haven't focused on the specifics.''\par \par \uc2 Mr. Norquist, who prefers Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's tax plan, has been clamoring to hear more about how it will help businesses and spur economic growth. And why was no attention paid to the taxation of companies in the ''sharing economy,'' like Uber and \uc2 Airbnb\uc2 ?\par \par \uc2 Immigration\par \par \uc2 The construction of a wall along the United States' border with Mexico has been a centerpiece of Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's campaign, and an immigration overhaul is an important priority for Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , yet the topic received scant attention.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  promised to get ''bad hombres'' out of the country. But little light was shed on how he or Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  would prioritize the removal of undocumented immigrants, or what must be done differently to secure the border beyond existing measures.\par \par \uc2 ''Voters are owed a detailed description of how we should move toward comprehensive immigration reform,'' said Michael Dear, a University of California at Berkeley professor who has researched the feasibility of a border wall.\par \par \uc2 The Supreme Court\par \par \uc2 The future of the Supreme Court is one of the biggest concerns among Republicans and Democrats, but only cursory commentary was given to the sorts of questions that the court, and any new justices the next president appoints, may have to consider.\par \par \uc2 ''Of all the issues, this is the one place where the \uc2 election\uc2  can have a clear and instant effect,'' said Julian E. Zelizer, a history professor at Princeton University.\par \par \uc2 Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  has said that Judge \uc2 Merrick Garland\uc2 , President Obama's pick to fill the current vacancy, should be approved by the current Congress, but she still has not been clear about how she would handle his nomination if she is elected and he has not yet been confirmed. On Wednesday night, she spoke only generally about how she would appoint judges who would stand up for the American people.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  has offered little detail about what he prizes in potential Supreme Court justices, other than to say that he would fill the court with jurists in the mold of Antonin Scalia and those who are likely to overturn Roe v. Wade.\par \par \uc2 Health Care\par \par \uc2 Republicans have been fighting to repeal the Affordable Care Act since President Obama signed it into law, but in 2016 it has become something of an afterthought.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  wants to replace the health law with something, he says, that ''works.'' Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  has acknowledged that parts of the law need fixing, but said nothing specific about how she would curb rising health care costs.\par \par \uc2 ''The surprise has been the nonexistent discussion of how to contain prescription drug prices,'' said \uc2 John Rother\uc2 , president of the \uc2 National Coalition on Health Care\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Still, Mr. Rother said he sympathized with the desire to keep things simple. ''Hillary has to be cautious given her history and her wonk tendencies,'' he said, ''and \uc2 Trump\uc2  is uninformed on health policy.''\par \par \uc2 Entitlements\par \par \uc2 With so little focus on deficits, the national debt and funding for Social Security, the \uc2 U.S. Chamber of Commerce\uc2  wrote to Chris Wallace, the moderator of Wednesday's debate, imploring him to press the candidates about their plans.\par \par \uc2 ''We have heard very little to this point,'' the chamber wrote, adding that ''what we have heard has been distressing, with the candidates proposing to either do nothing or actually expand (rather than reform) these programs.''\par \par \uc2 At the debate, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  said that his tax cuts would stimulate economic growth and finance entitlement programs. Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  said that she would tax the rich and reduce entitlement spending by making ''harder decisions.'' But the discussion ran aground when Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , in an aside, poked at Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  over his tax avoidance, and he called her a ''nasty woman.''\par \par \uc2 Climate Change\par \par \uc2 Climate change might be one of the most consequential issues facing the planet, but it barely got a mention in the three 90-minute presidential debates: Fewer than five and a half minutes all told, according to the environmental website Grist.\par \par \uc2 Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  hit Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  for suggesting that global warming was a ''hoax'' perpetrated by the Chinese, yet she offered few solutions beyond the deployment of more solar panels. Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  underscored his support for domestic drilling and burning coal, and in the second debate he dismissed alternative energy sources by saying the United States could not be powered by wind and solar energy alone.\par \par \uc2 So little attention was paid to climate change that some activists took matters into their own hands. The Yale School of Environmental Studies published a guide on social media about what Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  and Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  have said about energy and the environment to help voters judge for themselves.\par \par \uc2 Find out what you need to know about the 2016 presidential race today, and get politics news updates via \uc2 Facebook\uc2 , \uc2 Twitter\uc2  and the First Draft
