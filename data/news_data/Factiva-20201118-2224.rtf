\par\par \uc2 THE 2016 RACE\par \uc2 National Desk; SECTA\par \b \uc2 Latest Upshot Poll Shows \uc2 Trump\uc2  With a Lead in Florida\b0\par\par\uc2 By NATE COHN \par \uc2 1,587 \uc2 words\par \uc2 31 October 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 17\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2  has slowly but surely improved his standing in state and national polls since the final presidential debate.\par \par \uc2 A \uc2 New York Times\uc2  Upshot/Siena poll released Sunday is consistent with that trend: It gives Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  a four-point lead in Florida, 46 percent to 42 percent, in a four-way race. In our first poll of Florida a month ago, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  trailed \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  by a percentage point.\par \par \uc2 The survey is Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's best recent poll in Florida, and it should be interpreted with caution. In general, it is best to look at an average of polls. Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  still leads in an average of recent Florida surveys by nearly three points.\par \par \uc2 But the poll is not the only one to show Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  in the lead. A Bloomberg/Selzer poll, which is methodologically similar to the \uc2 New York Times\uc2  Upshot/Siena poll, showed Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  with a two-point edge last week.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , a Republican, has no plausible path to the presidency without Florida's 29 electoral votes. But his Democratic opponent has many ways to win without the state. Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  would almost certainly win if she carried North Carolina and Pennsylvania, where recent Upshot/Siena polls have shown her with a comfortable advantage.\par \par \uc2 The poll was taken before the F.B.I. director, James Comey, informed Congress that the bureau had obtained additional information of potential relevance to an investigation into Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's emails. National polls ahead of Mr. Comey's letter showed Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  with a six-point lead, an edge that was somewhat smaller than it was earlier in the month.\par \par \uc2 The poll paints a much rosier picture for Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 . Across every dimension of the survey, the poll has subtle but good news for his chances. If Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  won the \uc2 election\uc2 , it probably would look a lot like this:\par \par \uc2 Far greater Republican unity\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  won 86 percent of self-identified Republicans -- the highest percentage of that group in any Upshot/Siena survey so far this year.\par \par \uc2 He had the support of 84 percent of registered Republicans, up from 72 percent in September and also the highest of any Upshot/Siena survey this year.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's consolidation of Republican-leaning voters is a trend in national surveys, and it comes alongside a corresponding decline in the number of supporters for \uc2 Gary Johnson\uc2 , the Libertarian candidate, who received just 4 percent of the vote in our survey -- the lowest of any Upshot/Siena poll. Republicans have been likelier than Democrats to support Mr. Johnson in most of our polls.\par \par \uc2 Even college-educated white voters, who have been skeptical of Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  nationwide, are showing less skepticism in Florida. He has a lead of 51 percent to 35 percent among those voters in our survey.\par \par \uc2 Clinton\uc2  weakness among white working-class Democrats\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  leads among white voters without a college degree by an impressive margin of 63 percent to 24 percent. He's so strong that Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  has just 55 percent of the vote among white registered Democrats without a degree, compared with Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's 32 percent.\par \par \uc2 The combination of Republican unity and a large dissenting vote among registered Democrats is responsible for Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's lead.\par \par \uc2 Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  actually leads among voters who are unaffiliated with a major party -- something that's been true in all five Upshot surveys: in North Carolina (two surveys), Florida (two) and Pennsylvania (one). In this case, it's by a 14-point margin.\par \par \uc2 Our survey is adjusted to have the right number of registered Democrats and Republicans, which is generally a good way to make sure that a sample doesn't wind up being too Democratic or Republican. Democrats have a one-point registration edge among likely voters.\par \par \uc2 But because of this large dissenting vote from white working-class registered Democrats, and the unity of registered Republicans, the Republicans have a four-point advantage in voters' party identification in survey responses.\par \par \uc2 A \uc2 Clinton\uc2  challenge with black voters?\par \par \uc2 Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  has had nearly unanimous support among black voters in Upshot/Siena surveys, but not in this one: She had a lead of 81 percent to 11 percent. It might not seem like a big deal, but the difference between that support and the 90-1 we saw from black voters in Pennsylvania covers about half of Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's lead.\par \par \uc2 One possibility is that this is random sampling error -- we're talking about seven black respondents who support Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  in our survey. But there are at least hints that Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  may be a tad stronger among black voters in Florida than elsewhere. Our first Upshot/Siena poll of Florida in September gave Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  a lead of 83 percent to 4 percent among black voters, which was her worst performance among black voters in any of The Upshot's polls up until now. A recent Selzer poll of Florida also gave Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  a similar lead of 80 percent to 10 percent among black voters.\par \par \uc2 Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  also had a challenge with black turnout. Voters who indicated on their voter registration form that they were black made up 12.7 percent of the likely electorate, down from 13.9 percent in 2012. Our North Carolina survey also showed the black share of the electorate dipping by about one point lower than 2012 levels. It's a pattern that's consistent with the initial early voting data, which shows lower black turnout than in 2012.\par \par \uc2 Cubans return to \uc2 Trump\par \par \uc2 Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  leads among Hispanic voters by a wide margin of 59 percent to 30 percent in our survey -- a tally that's pretty comparable to most recent Florida polls. But it is better for Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  than our September survey, when Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  led by a margin of 61 percent to 21 percent.\par \par \uc2 Here, it is Cuban-American voters who make the difference. In September, Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  had a lead of 41 percent to 33 percent among Cuban voters, with a huge number undecided or supporting a minor-party candidate. Now Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  leads, 52 percent vs. 42 percent.\par \par \uc2 Again, these are very small samples. But it's plausible to imagine Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  recovering among Cuban voters.\par \par \uc2 A strong showing among Cuban voters also helped Senator \uc2 Marco Rubio\uc2  lead by nine points, 51 percent to 42 percent, against his Democratic challenger, Patrick Murphy. Mr. Murphy led by just two percentage points among Hispanic voters, and Mr. Rubio led by 69-28 among Cuban voters.\par \par \uc2 A mystery factor: partisan nonresponse\par \par \uc2 One of the biggest questions in political survey research is partisan nonresponse -- the possibility that Democrats or Republicans are more or less likely to respond to polls.\par \par \uc2 Most public polls don't have many ways to deal with it. They weight their surveys to match the demographic composition of adults -- say, the right number of white and black voters -- but they don't adjust the number of Democrats or Republicans.\par \par \uc2 Our surveys are different: As mentioned earlier, they're adjusted to have the right number of Democrats or Republicans.\par \par \uc2 In our survey, registered Democrats were much likelier to respond than Republicans. Registered Democrats had an eight-point registration advantage in our unweighted sample, even though it was representative by other measures.\par \par \uc2 Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  would have actually led in The Upshot's survey if it, like most others, didn't weight by party registration.\par \par \uc2 One possibility is that the public polls are understating Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's support because registered Republicans aren't answering the telephone.\par \par \uc2 I would love to write that this was the only poll capturing the ''hidden'' \uc2 Trump\uc2  vote. And I would note that the Selzer/Bloomberg poll of Florida also happens to be weighted by party registration.\par \par \uc2 But based on my reporting, this is probably not what's going on. Private pollsters are conducting surveys using similar methods, and they're not seeing this. And after all, our poll found that registered Republicans were extremely likely to indicate their support for Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  -- not exactly the shy \uc2 Trump\uc2  voter.\par \par \uc2 So let me conclude with a puzzle that highlights just how hard survey research can be.\par \par \uc2 Suppose, for the moment, that Republicans dissatisfied with Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  were less likely to respond to our survey, either by chance or because they were demoralized.\par \par \uc2 You would end up with a survey with too few Republicans, but those that you did have would be likely to support Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 It might not be so easy to adjust for partisan nonresponse.\par \par \uc2 If you then adjusted your survey to include the right number of registered Republicans, you would wind up with a sample full of Republicans who full-throatedly supported Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  -- even though the reason you had too few Republicans was because so many don't support him.\par \par \uc2 Is this what's going on here? Who knows. The point is that any time there's an adjustment for nonresponse, a pollster is making an assumption that the people being up-weighted are representative of the people who didn't respond. That's just an assumption, and it's not always right.\par \par \uc2 We'll find out for sure in nine very long days.\par \par \uc2 The Upshot provides news, analysis and graphics about politics, policy and everyday life.

PAINTER \par \uc2 907 \uc2 words\par \uc2 31 October 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 21\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 THE F.B.I. is currently investigating the hacking of Americans' computers by foreign governments. Russia is a prime suspect.\par \par \uc2 Imagine a possible connection between a candidate for president in the United States and the Russian computer hacking. Imagine the candidate has business dealings in Russia, and has publicly encouraged the Russians to hack the email of his opponent. It would not be surprising for the F.B.I. to include this candidate and his campaign staff in its confidential investigation of Russian computer hacking.\par \par \uc2 But it would be highly improper, and an abuse of power, for the F.B.I. to conduct such an investigation in the public eye, particularly on the eve of the \uc2 election\uc2 . It would be an abuse of power for the director of the F.B.I., absent compelling circumstances, to notify members of Congress that the candidate was under investigation. It would be an abuse of power if F.B.I. agents went so far as to obtain a search warrant and raid the candidate's office tower, hauling out boxes of documents and computers in front of television cameras.\par \par \uc2 The F.B.I.'s job is to investigate, not to influence the outcome of an \uc2 election\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Such acts could also be prohibited under the Hatch Act, which bars the use of an official position to influence an \uc2 election\uc2 . That is why the F.B.I. presumably would keep those aspects of an investigation confidential until after the \uc2 election\uc2 . The usual penalty for a violation is termination of federal employment.\par \par \uc2 That is why, on Saturday, I filed a complaint against the F.B.I. with the \uc2 Office of Special Counsel\uc2 , which investigates Hatch Act violations, and with the \uc2 Office of Government Ethics\uc2 . I spent much of my career working on government and lawyers' ethics, including as the chief White House ethics lawyer for George W. Bush. I never thought that the F.B.I. could be dragged into a political circus surrounding one of its investigations. Until this week.\par \par \uc2 (For the sake of full disclosure, in this \uc2 election\uc2  I have supported Jeb Bush, \uc2 Marco Rubio\uc2 , John Kasich and \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  for president, in that order.)\par \par \uc2 On Friday, the director of the F.B.I., James B. Comey, sent members of Congress a letter about developments in the agency's investigation of Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's emails, an investigation which supposedly was closed months ago. This letter, which was quickly posted on the internet, made highly unusual public statements about an F.B.I. investigation concerning a candidate in the \uc2 election\uc2 . The letter was sent in violation of a longstanding Justice Department policy of not discussing specifics about pending investigations with others, including members of Congress. According to some news reports, the letter was sent before the F.B.I. had even obtained the search warrant that it needed to look at the newly discovered emails. And it was sent days before the \uc2 election\uc2 , when many Americans are already voting.\par \par \uc2 Violations of the Hatch Act and of government ethics rules on misuse of official positions are not permissible in any circumstances, including in the case of an executive branch official acting under pressure from politically motivated members of Congress. Violations are of even greater concern when the agency is the F.B.I.\par \par \uc2 It is not clear whether Mr. Comey personally wanted to influence the outcome of the \uc2 election\uc2 , although his letter -- which cast suspicion on Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  without revealing specifics -- was concerning. Also concerning is the fact that Mr. Comey already made unusual public statements expressing his opinion about Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's actions, calling her handling of classified information ''extremely careless,'' when he announced this summer that the F.B.I. was concluding its investigation of her email without filing any charges.\par \par \uc2 But an official doesn't need to have a specific intent -- or desire -- to influence an \uc2 election\uc2  to be in violation of the Hatch Act or government ethics rules. The rules are violated if it is obvious that the official's actions could influence the \uc2 election\uc2 , there is no other good reason for taking those actions, and the official is acting under pressure from persons who obviously do want to influence the \uc2 election\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Absent extraordinary circumstances that might justify it, a public communication about a pending F.B.I. investigation involving a candidate that is made on the eve of an \uc2 election\uc2  is thus very likely to be a violation of the Hatch Act and a misuse of an official position. Serious questions also arise under lawyers' professional conduct rules that require prosecutors to avoid excessive publicity and unnecessary statements that could cause public condemnation even of people who have been accused of a crime, not to mention people like Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , who have never been charged with a crime.\par \par \uc2 This is no trivial matter. We cannot allow F.B.I. or Justice Department officials to unnecessarily publicize pending investigations concerning candidates of either party while an \uc2 election\uc2  is underway. That is an abuse of power. Allowing such a precedent to stand will invite more, and even worse, abuses of power in the future.\par \par \uc2 Follow The \uc2 New York Times\uc2  Opinion section on \uc2 Facebook\uc2  and \uc2 Twitter\uc2  (@NYTopinion), and sign up for the Opinion Today newsletter.\par \par \uc2 Richard W.

\par\par \uc2 Business/Financial Desk; SECTB\par \b \uc2 Peter Thiel\uc2 , Contrarian Tech Billionaire, Defends His Support of \uc2 Trump\b0\par\par\uc2 By DAVID STREITFELD \par \uc2 1,190 \uc2 words\par \uc2 31 October 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 1\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 SAN FRANCISCO -- \uc2 Peter Thiel\uc2  likes to take the path not taken. He has paid students to drop out of college, thinks Silicon Valley is overrated, backed a plan to build cities on the high seas and helped propel an electronic form of money into general use. His contrarian approach to investing and to life has made him rich and celebrated.\par \par \uc2 It took something truly conventional -- donating money to a presidential candidate -- to incite demands for his banishment.\par \par \uc2 Two weeks ago, Mr. Thiel revealed that he was donating $1.25 million to support the \uc2 election\uc2  of \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2 . As these things go, it was a small gift. Dustin Moskovitz, a founder of \uc2 Facebook\uc2 , is giving tens of millions to support \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 . But the news made Mr. Thiel a pariah in much of the tech community.\par \par \uc2 He was accused of promoting racism and intolerance. There were demands that \uc2 Facebook\uc2  drop him from its board of directors and that Silicon Valley's leading start-up incubator, \uc2 Y Combinator\uc2 , sever ties with him. Emotions and accusations raged on \uc2 Twitter\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 ''I was surprised by the intensity,'' Mr. Thiel said. ''This is one of the few times I was involved in something that was not a fringe effort but was mainstream. Millions of people are backing \uc2 Trump\uc2 . I did not appreciate quite how polarizing the \uc2 election\uc2  would be in Silicon Valley and elsewhere.''\par \par \uc2 On Monday, Mr. Thiel plans to defend his position in a speech and then a question-and-answer session with reporters at the \uc2 National Press Club in Washington\uc2 . For the entrepreneur, who secretly funded the lawsuit that brought down the gossip website Gawker, it is a particularly surprising venue.\par \par \uc2 In an interview on Friday, he outlined his thinking. ''Ideally, this will have the give-and-take of debate,'' he said. ''Obviously, I'll get some very tough questions about \uc2 Trump\uc2 . But I thought the best way to advance the discussion was not to have some completely contrived format. The future of this country depends on us engaging with the tough questions.''\par \par \uc2 One of the things he will try to do is underline his support for \uc2 Trump\uc2  the candidate while distancing himself from the behavior of \uc2 Trump\uc2  the man. He believes it is possible to separate the two.\par \par \uc2 ''The millions of people who vote for \uc2 Trump\uc2  are not doing it because of the worst things he said or did,'' Mr. Thiel said. ''That's ridiculous. The Americans who are voting for \uc2 Trump\uc2  are doing it because they judge the situation of the country to be urgent. We're at such a crucial point that you have to overlook personal characteristics.''\par \par \uc2 Mr. Thiel has been an important player in Silicon Valley since the first dot-com boom, but he has recently taken on a much more public role. He was born in Germany and came to the United States as an infant when his father, a chemical engineer, found work here. He was raised in Silicon Valley and went to Stanford, where he developed the views in his first book, ''The Diversity Myth,'' about the multiculturalism debate on campuses, written with the entrepreneur \uc2 David O. Sacks\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 In 1998, Mr. Thiel helped found the online payments company \uc2 PayPal\uc2 , an immediate success. He was the first outside investor in \uc2 Facebook\uc2 . Forbes estimates his net worth at $2.7 billion. Last year, he became a part-time partner at \uc2 Y Combinator\uc2 , a loosely defined advisory position.\par \par \uc2 A handful of others in Silicon Valley have similar investing track records. Where Mr. Thiel really separates himself from his peers is his skepticism that Silicon Valley is building a better world for all. His investment firm, \uc2 Founders Fund\uc2 , used to begin its online manifesto with the complaint, ''We wanted flying cars; instead we got 140 characters,'' a reference to \uc2 Twitter\uc2 . Now it says simply, ''What happened to the future?''\par \par \uc2 San Francisco, Manhattan and Washington, D.C., are doing well, but the presidential campaign has laid bare the angst of many other places. Feelings of decline are rampant. ''Most of the millennials have lower expectations than their baby boomer parents,'' Mr. Thiel said. ''Where I differ from others in Silicon Valley is in thinking that you can't fence yourself off. If it continues, it will ultimately be bad for everybody.''\par \par \uc2 The polls have been saying Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  is likely to win. If that happens, ''there will be a very big need to push back on the sort of happy but misleading consensus about things,'' Mr. Thiel said. ''There will be an important role for me and others to somehow play in speaking truth to power.''\par \par \uc2 To an extent, that is. ''It would be a mistake and inappropriate to instantly demonize Hillary and to try and sabotage her presidency,'' he said. That would be repeating what happened in 2008, when the Republican Party did exactly that to President Obama.\par \par \uc2 That is the larger discussion Mr. Thiel intends to be involved in. Another, more local discussion is already underway about his role in Silicon Valley.\par \par \uc2 ''By lending his image, his voice, his influence and substantial capital to \uc2 Trump\uc2 , Thiel isn't simply exercising his legal right to vote: He is fueling and enabling racism, sexism, sexual assault, violence and tyranny,'' Arlan Hamilton of Backstage Capital, a Los Angeles venture firm, wrote in a blog post.\par \par \uc2 She said she turned down an investment of $500,000 -- a huge sum for a small firm like Backstage -- because of the investor's ties to Mr. Thiel. Ms. Hamilton did not identify the investor or respond to an email.\par \par \uc2 Mark Zuckerberg\uc2 , chief executive of Facebook, defended the company's association with Mr. Thiel, emphasizing that it did not endorse his views -- and much less Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's -- but was striving to be inclusive toward those whose values differed from its own. Critics noted that if diversity was such a cherished value in Silicon Valley, why wasn't there more of it?\par \par \uc2 Mr. Thiel said he agreed that there was a point where views became unacceptable, but argued that he was on the right side of the line.\par \par \uc2 ''The line cannot or should not be at a point where you're excommunicating half the country,'' he said. ''Some fringe views I hope we can tolerate. Some fringe views are beyond the pale.'' He said no one at \uc2 Facebook\uc2  or \uc2 Y Combinator\uc2  had asked him to censor himself, and he did not consider stepping down from either post.\par \par \uc2 The donation to the \uc2 Trump\uc2  campaign proved much more contentious in Silicon Valley than the revelation in May that Mr. Thiel had secretly funded a lawsuit to kill Gawker, which revealed in 2007 that he was gay. Many in Silicon Valley were sympathetic to Mr. Thiel's actions.\par \par \uc2 When Gawker.com was shut down in August, Mr. Thiel said he had one final thought: ''Good riddance.''\par \par \uc2 Peter Thiel faces a backlash.

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 There is no shortage of comedians weighing in on the current \uc2 election\uc2 , but it often seems like the tools of satire are insufficient to comment on this absurd and exhausting campaign. Perhaps we need to look to a darker corner of the culture, where the punch lines end with bruises.\par \par \uc2 ''The Pumpkin Pie Show: Stump Speeches,'' the delightfully perverse, political-themed installment of the annual macabre merriment led by the writer and performer Clay McLeod Chapman, provides strong evidence that the bloody tools of Lovecraftian horror are effective this political season. This series of vignettes, organized around a fictional \uc2 election\uc2  between the sex-scandal-ridden Senator Pendleton (Mr. Chapman) and the hungrily ambitious Senator Templeton (Kristen Vaughan), begins with the normal -- campaign speeches, debates, political commentary -- then spins off into the supernatural, sinister and strange.\par \par \uc2 What makes Mr. Chapman -- a screenwriter for the 2015 indie horror movie ''The Boy'' -- such a skilled craftsman is he does not choose between subtle and heavy-handed or teasing suspense and gruesome shocks. He knows that in the best horror, the vulgar dances with the refined.\par \par \uc2 His play is not dogmatic (there are bits in here to appeal to haters of both \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  and \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2 ) but oblique. He tiptoes around direct references to specific politicians or famous scary stories, but hints at both. ''To make our nation great, everyone's gotta make sacrifices,'' his senator announces in a debate, before an ominous pause. ''Ancient sacrifices.''\par \par \uc2 Brian Silliman and Abe Goldfarb, as a Greek chorus of political analysts, mimic the hyped-up gladiatorial language of the cable news networks, but push their violent rhetoric to the extreme. Partisans for both sides deliver apocalyptic broadsides that manage to be grotesque without sounding all that different from what we hear every day. When Senator Templeton stirs up fears of the first female president, it's almost inevitable this leads to talk of menstrual blood.\par \par \uc2 Hanna Cheek, a longtime star of the ''Pumpkin Pie Show,'' does a nice job as a political wife whose desperation has hardened into a nasty plastic smile. But it's Mr. Chapman, bald with a beard pointy enough to poke an eye out, who really commands attention, with a turn that pushes cracked madness right over into cartoon silliness. It's a spooky performance that eventually finds its way to comedy, but takes the scenic route.\par \par \uc2 ''The Pumpkin Pie Show: Stump Speeches'' continues through Saturday at Under St. Marks, 85 East Fourth Street, Manhattan; 212-777-6088. Running time: 1 hour 15 minutes.\par \par \uc2 The Pumpkin Pie Show: Stump Speeches: Clay McLeod Chapman melds horror and politics at Under St. Marks.

\par\par \uc2 Metropolitan Desk; SECTA\par \b \uc2 In Senate Debate, a Proxy War for Presidential Hopefuls\b0\par\par\uc2 By VIVIAN YEE \par \uc2 779 \uc2 words\par \uc2 31 October 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 19\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 During a debate on Sunday, Senator \uc2 Chuck Schumer\uc2  of New York pronounced himself ''appalled'' -- at least four times -- that the director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation had disclosed that he was again looking into the matter of \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's emails without yet knowing the significance of a newly discovered batch.\par \par \uc2 ''He doesn't even know what was in them, and yet he goes ahead and writes a letter,'' said Mr. Schumer, a Democrat, adding that the director, James Comey, owed the nation a fuller explanation.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Schumer's Republican challenger, Wendy E. Long, responded by arguing that Mr. Comey had a duty to evaluate any new evidence in the inquiry. And she added a knife twist, noting that the new emails had come to the F.B.I.'s attention amid an investigation into sexual messages sent by Anthony D. Weiner, who was, Ms. Long told Mr. Schumer with a smile, ''your old prot\u233\'00\'E9g\u233\'00\'E9 and friend.''\par \par \uc2 So it went at Union College in Schenectady, N.Y., where the two candidates for the Senate often appeared to be waging a proxy war for each party's presidential nominee and their records as often as discussing their own differences in the debate, sponsored by NY1.\par \par \uc2 He zigged left. She zagged, well, wherever \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2  and his populist credo took her.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's ideas had caused Ms. Long to ''think again'' about conventional Republican positions on trade and military intervention in the Middle East, she said, casting his principles as ''American principles'' and ''conservative principles.''\par \par \uc2 She argued that some liberals were ''hypocritical'' for criticizing Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  over his vulgar boasts about women, denouncing ''all the racism and misogyny'' in the comedian Amy Schumer's standup routines, in Howard Stern's radio show and in Jay Z's lyrics.\par \par \uc2 ''Neither Amy Schumer, nor Jay Z, nor Howard Stern is running for president,'' retorted Mr. Schumer, who is related, if distantly, to Ms. Schumer. ''I don't think most Americans would think they would make good presidents, either.''\par \par \uc2 Ms. Long is a virtual unknown in New York, despite having run for the Senate seat held by Kirsten E. Gillibrand four years ago, making her race against Mr. Schumer a mismatch of experience, of poll numbers -- Mr. Schumer holds a commanding lead -- and of consequence: If elected with a Democratic majority, Mr. Schumer stands to become the next Senate majority leader.\par \par \uc2 Rather than acquainting voters with her own background -- even after a question along those lines from Liz Benjamin, one of the debate's moderators -- Ms. Long made the debate about Mr. Schumer from the start. She tied him to Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  again and again, saying he had ''learned from the master on public and private positions,'' a reference to a hacked email recounting Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's comments to bank executives. When Mr. Schumer said his vote against the Iran nuclear deal demonstrated his independence from Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , Ms. Long went on the offensive, saying he had done little to criticize or block the deal.\par \par \uc2 And she repeatedly suggested he had not done enough to regulate big banks because of his many Wall Street donors, triggering a lengthy exchange over the particulars of banking regulation and the Dodd-Frank Act.\par \par \uc2 ''I think, actually, a good nickname for him would be the senator from 'The Big Short,''' Ms. Long said, referring to the book and movie of the same name that dissected the financial crisis of 2008. (She, on the other hand, was the ''Bernie Sanders of campaign contributions,'' Ms. Long said, describing the many prayers and notes of encouragement she had received from small donors.)\par \par \uc2 Ms. Long often broke from Republican orthodoxy, emphasizing not only her opposition to global trade pacts but also her support for unions and her willingness to find a balance between clean air and keeping coal miners working.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Schumer occasionally betrayed a whiff of exasperation. ''You ought to get your facts right,'' he said at one point. But he seemed, for the most part, in control, counterpunching on the campaign contributions issue by arguing that the best way to remove money from politics was to nominate a Supreme Court justice who would help overturn the 2010 \uc2 Citizens United\uc2  decision.\par \par \uc2 Nor did he fail to bask, just for a moment, in the possibilities the \uc2 election\uc2  offered. When a moderator mentioned he could become Senate majority leader, Mr. Schumer replied: ''Not bad for New York, right?''\par \par \uc2 Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, a Democrat, debated Wendy E. Long, his Republican challenger, on Sunday night.

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 By now, most people have heard \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2 's fact-free claims that the \uc2 election\uc2  is ''rigged'' against him and his dangerous calls for supporters to act as poll-watchers and thwart alleged voter fraud in ''certain areas'' -- by which he means minority communities in big cities like Philadelphia and Chicago.\par \par \uc2 Far fewer people are aware that for more than three decades, the \uc2 Republican National Committee\uc2  has been under the supervision of a federal court for repeatedly engaging in the same behavior.\par \par \uc2 Last week, the \uc2 Democratic National Committee\uc2  asked a federal judge in New Jersey to hold the R.N.C. in contempt for once again violating the terms of that supervision -- known as a consent decree -- by coordinating with and supporting the \uc2 Trump\uc2  campaign's efforts to intimidate minority voters, who tend to vote Democratic, and keep them from the polls. If the R.N.C. is found liable, the decree, which is set to expire next year, will be extended for eight more years.\par \par \uc2 The original decree was issued in 1982 by the Federal District Court in New Jersey after the R.N.C. allegedly tried to intimidate registered voters in black communities by, among other things, hiring off-duty sheriffs and police officers to stand at polling places displaying their guns and armbands that said ''National Ballot Security Task Force.'' It barred the national committee and its ''agents'' from ''ballot security activities'' that deter qualified minority voters from voting, whether intentionally or not.\par \par \uc2 In 1987, the court extended the decree, which applies nationwide, after allegations that R.N.C. officials created a voter-challenge list in Louisiana to, as one internal memo put it, ''keep the black vote down considerably.'' It also required the national committee to get judicial approval before organizing or directing any poll-watching activities. In 2009, following several other episodes of alleged minority-voter intimidation involving the R.N.C., the decree was again extended for eight years.\par \par \uc2 In other words, \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2 's abhorrent efforts to keep black and other minority citizens from voting are only the latest example of a long-running Republican strategy. Unsurprisingly, the man behind the New Jersey voter-intimidation case that led to the original decree, Roger Stone, is now one of Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's top advisers. On Oct. 23, Mr. Stone, who has updated his bag of dirty tricks for the digital era, sent a now-deleted tweet intended to mislead \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  supporters by encouraging them to ''vote the new way'' -- by text message.\par \par \uc2 The R.N.C. says it does not condone this sort of behavior, and it recently warned its members not to violate the decree. At the same time, the committee's chairman, Reince Priebus, said earlier this month, ''I want to make it very clear that the R.N.C. is in full coordination with the \uc2 Trump\uc2  campaign,'' and that ''we remain very much involved and together in all levels in making these decisions of how best to run the operation across the country.''\par \par \uc2 Of course, the claims of voter fraud are themselves fraudulent; in-person voter fraud essentially never happens, as study after study has confirmed. As the federal court in New Jersey said in 2009, voter intimidation of the type the \uc2 Trump\uc2  campaign is now encouraging, and in which the R.N.C. has engaged, ''presents an ongoing threat to the participation of minority individuals in the political process, and continues to pose a far greater danger to the integrity of that process than the type of voter fraud the R.N.C. is prevented from addressing by the decree.''\par \par \uc2 The danger is exacerbated now that the Justice Department is sending only a fraction of the 32,000 federal \uc2 election\uc2  observers it deployed around the country in 2012 to help deter intimidation tactics. This cutback is the direct result of the Supreme Court's 2013 decision striking down the heart of the Voting Rights Act, which had required states and jurisdictions with the worst histories of voter discrimination to get pre-approval from federal courts before making any changes to their voting laws.\par \par \uc2 Republicans have long known that their chances of winning go up when the number of voters -- and especially minority voters -- goes down. The party's embrace of Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , even as he openly urges ''everybody to go out and watch'' polling places because ''we don't want this \uc2 election\uc2  stolen from us'' is another manifestation of its shameful record on voter suppression.\par \par \uc2 DRAWING (DRAWING BY MIGUEL PORLAN) \par \par \uc2 Document NYTF000020161031ecav00051\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 On Nov. 8, the United States will elect a president and potentially elevate \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , a former first lady, to the country's highest office.\par \par \uc2 Just two days before that, Nicaragua will hold an \uc2 election\uc2  in which another first lady is seeking office. Rosario Murillo, the wife of President Daniel Ortega, will run on her husband's ticket as his vice presidential candidate.\par \par \uc2 Here are some of the world's other power couples:\par \par \uc2 Sirimavo Bandaranaike\par \par \uc2 Sirimavo Bandaranaike of Sri Lanka was the first woman in the world to serve as prime minister. And she did it three times.\par \par \uc2 Known as Mrs. B., she became the head of the country's government in 1960 after her husband, Solomon, was assassinated. She served from 1960 to 1965, from 1970 to 1977 and again, in a more ceremonial role, from 1994 to 2000 while her daughter, Chandrika Kumaratunga, was the president.\par \par \uc2 Khaleda Zia\par \par \uc2 Khaleda Zia's husband, President Ziaur Rahman of Bangladesh, was assassinated while in office in 1981.\par \par \uc2 Mrs. Zia became prime minister 10 years later. She served from 1991 to 1996 and again from 2001 to 2006. She made Forbes's list of the World's 100 Most Powerful Women three times, but she is now on bail awaiting trial in cases that include corruption charges.\par \par \uc2 Mar\u237\'00\'EDa Estela Mart\u237\'00\'EDnez de Per\u243\'00\'F3n\par \par \uc2 In 1951, Eva Per\u243\'00\'F3n tried to run for vice president of Argentina on a ticket with her husband, Gen. Juan Domingo Per\u243\'00\'F3n. Her candidacy was met with an uproar from the opposition. She withdrew, and died a year later.\par \par \uc2 General Per\u243\'00\'F3n's third wife, Mar\u237\'00\'EDa Estela Mart\u237\'00\'EDnez de Per\u243\'00\'F3n, a former dancer known as Isabel, was made vice president after her husband's return to power in 1973.\par \par \uc2 She became Argentina's first female president upon his death a year later but was ousted in a military coup in 1976. She lives in exile in Spain, which decided against extraditing her to Argentina on charges of human rights abuse.\par \par \uc2 Benazir Bhutto\par \par \uc2 Benazir Bhutto was twice the prime minister of Pakistan. Unlike many other women, she was elected before her husband took office. She was, however, the daughter of a former prime minister.\par \par \uc2 Ms. Bhutto was the first woman to be democratically elected to lead a modern Muslim country. She was prime minister from 1988 to 1990 and from 1993 to 1996. She was assassinated in 2007; her husband, \uc2 Asif Ali Zardari\uc2 , was president from 2008 to 2013.\par \par \uc2 Janet Jagan\par \par \uc2 Janet Jagan was elected president of Guyana in 1997, after the death of her husband, President Cheddi Jagan.\par \par \uc2 An American by birth, Mrs. Jagan had a mild heart attack while in office and stepped down only two years into her term. She died in 2009 at age 88.\par \par \uc2 Mireya Moscoso\par \par \uc2 Mireya Moscoso was president of Panama from 1999 to 2004.\par \par \uc2 Her husband, Arnulfo Arias, almost 45 years her senior, had been president three times, including one term that lasted 11 days.\par \par \uc2 After Mr. Arias died in exile, Ms. Moscoso returned to Panama and became president.\par \par \uc2 Cristina Fern\u225\'00\'E1ndez de Kirchner\par \par \uc2 Cristina Fern\u225\'00\'E1ndez de Kirchner was the first woman to be elected president of Argentina, rather than assume the position after it was vacated by the death of a husband, as Isabel Per\u243\'00\'F3n did in 1974.\par \par \uc2 Mrs. Kirchner's husband, N\u233\'00\'E9stor, was president from 2003 to 2007. She succeeded him, serving two terms, from 2007 to 2015. (He died while she was in office.)\par \par \uc2 A lawyer and former senator, Mrs. Kirchner was recently indicted on charges of manipulating the Central Bank during her last months in office.\par \par \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  and former President Bill \uc2 Clinton\uc2  in January.

\par\par \uc2 OP-ED COLUMNIST\par \uc2 Editorial Desk; SECTA\par \b \uc2 Working the Refs\b0\par\par\uc2 873 \uc2 words\par \uc2 31 October 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 21\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 The cryptic letter James Comey, the F.B.I. director, sent to Congress on Friday looked bizarre at the time -- seeming to hint at a major new \uc2 Clinton\uc2  scandal, but offering no substance. Given what we know now, however, it was worse than bizarre, it was outrageous. Mr. Comey apparently had no evidence suggesting any wrongdoing by \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 ; he violated longstanding rules about commenting on politically sensitive investigations close to an \uc2 election\uc2 ; and he did so despite being warned by other officials that he was doing something terribly wrong.\par \par \uc2 So what happened? We may never know the full story, but the best guess is that Mr. Comey, like many others -- media organizations, would-be nonpartisan advocacy groups, and more -- let himself be bullied by the usual suspects. Working the refs -- screaming about bias and unfair treatment, no matter how favorable the treatment actually is -- has been a consistent, long-term political strategy on the right. And the reason it keeps happening is because it so often works.\par \par \uc2 You see this most obviously in news coverage. Reporters who find themselves shut up in pens at \uc2 Trump\uc2  rallies while the crowd shouts abuse shouldn't be surprised: constant accusations of liberal media bias have been a staple of Republican rhetoric for decades. And why not? The pressure has been effective.\par \par \uc2 Part of this effectiveness comes through false equivalence: news organizations, afraid of being attacked for bias, give evenhanded treatment to lies and truth. Way back in 2000 I suggested that if a Republican candidate said that the earth was flat, headlines would read, ''Views differ on shape of planet.'' That still happens.\par \par \uc2 The desire to get right-wing critics off one's back may also explain why the news media keep falling for fake scandals. There's a straight line from the Whitewater investigation -- which ran for seven years, was endlessly hyped in the press, but never found any wrongdoing on the part of the Clintons -- to the catastrophically bad coverage of the \uc2 Clinton\uc2  Foundation\uc2  a couple of months ago. Remember when The Associated Press suggested scandalous undue influence based on a meeting between \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  and a donor who just happened to be both a Nobel Prize winner and an old personal friend?\par \par \uc2 Sure enough, much of the initial coverage of the Comey letter was based not on what the letter said, which was very little, but on a false, malicious characterization of the letter by Jason Chaffetz, the Republican chairman of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform. You might think reporters would have learned by now not to take what people like Mr. Chaffetz say at face value. Apparently not.\par \par \uc2 Nor is it just the news media. A few years ago, during the peak of deficit-scold influence, it was striking to see the various organizations demanding deficit reduction pretend that Democrats who were willing to compromise and Republicans who insisted on slashing taxes for the wealthy were equally at fault. They even gave a ''fiscal responsibility'' award to \uc2 Paul Ryan\uc2 , whose budget proposals gave smoke and mirrors a bad name.\par \par \uc2 And as someone who still keeps a foot in the academic world, I've been watching pressure build on universities to hire more conservatives. Never mind the way climate denial, attacks on the theory of evolution, and all that may have pushed academics out of the G.O.P. The fact that relatively few conservatives teach, say, physics, is supposed to be grossly unfair. And you know some schools will start hiring less qualified people in response.\par \par \uc2 Which brings us back to Mr. Comey. It seemed obvious from the start that Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's decision to follow \uc2 Colin Powell\uc2 's advice and bypass State Department email was a mistake, but nothing remotely approaching a crime. But Mr. Comey was subjected to a constant barrage of demands that he prosecute her for ... something. He should simply have said no. Instead, even while announcing back in July that no charges would be filed, he editorialized about her conduct -- a wholly inappropriate thing to do, but probably an attempt to appease the right.\par \par \uc2 It didn't work, of course. They just demanded more. And it looks as if he tried to buy them off by throwing them a bone just a few days before the \uc2 election\uc2 . Whether it will matter politically remains to be seen, but one thing is clear: he destroyed his own reputation.\par \par \uc2 The moral of the story is that appeasing the modern American right is a losing proposition. Nothing you do convinces them that you're being fair, because fairness has nothing to do with it. The right long ago ran out of good ideas that can be sold on their own merits, so the goal now is to remove merit from the picture.\par \par \uc2 Or to put it another way, they're trying to create bias, not end it, and weakness -- the kind of weakness Mr. Comey has so spectacularly displayed -- only encourages them to do more.\par \par \uc2 Read my blog, The Conscience of a Liberal, and follow me on Twitter, @PaulKrugman.\par \par \uc2 Follow The \uc2 New York Times\uc2  Opinion section on \uc2 Facebook\uc2  and Twitter (@NYTopinion), and sign up for the Opinion Today newsletter.\par \par \uc2 Document NYTF000020161031ecav0004u\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 National Desk; SECTA\par \b \uc2 Agents Cleared to Scrutinize Email Cache\b0\par\par\uc2 By MATT APUZZO, MICHAEL S. SCHMIDT and ADAM GOLDMAN; William K. Rashbaum contributed reporting from New York. \par \uc2 1,313 \uc2 words\par \uc2 31 October 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 1\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 WASHINGTON -- Federal investigators have obtained a warrant to begin searching a large cache of emails belonging to a top aide to \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , law enforcement officials said on Sunday, as prosecutors and F.B.I. agents scrambled under intense public pressure to assess their significance before \uc2 Election\uc2  Day.\par \par \uc2 It remains unclear whether they can finish their work by then. ''The process has begun,'' a federal law enforcement official said.\par \par \uc2 The hurried pace at the Justice Department and the F.B.I. raises the prospect that law enforcement officials will again publicly discuss a continuing investigation involving a presidential candidate in the final days of the campaign. The F.B.I. director, James B. Comey, has faced extraordinary criticism since he sent an ambiguous letter to congressional leaders telling them that agents had discovered new emails.\par \par \uc2 Agents in an unrelated investigation of Anthony D. Weiner, the disgraced former congressman, found the emails, belonging to his estranged wife, Huma Abedin, the aide to Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , this month. That prompted a renewed interest among agents who had investigated Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  for her use of a private email server as secretary of state. That investigation centered on whether Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  or her aides had mishandled classified information. Prosecutors concluded that case in July without bringing charges.\par \par \uc2 A federal law enforcement official said agents had discovered hundreds of thousands of emails on Mr. Weiner's computer, but investigators expected to examine only part of the total. Agents will have probable cause to search only the messages related to the \uc2 Clinton\uc2  investigation. Some of Ms. Abedin's emails passed through Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's private server, officials said, which means there is a high likelihood that the F.B.I. has already read them.\par \par \uc2 Officials cautioned that there was no evidence to date that changed the Justice Department's conclusion that neither Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  nor her aides should be charged. They said it was possible that the review would turn up nothing, but said investigators felt obligated to check.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Comey has faced widespread criticism since his announcement on Friday, and senior Justice Department and F.B.I. officials have been under tremendous pressure to review the emails quickly and assess their importance. Both Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  and her Republican rival, \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , have called for the F.B.I. to say publicly what it knows before \uc2 Election\uc2  Day.\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 Clinton\uc2  campaign kept up the pressure on Mr. Comey on Sunday by releasing a letter signed by nearly 100 former senior Justice Department officials who sharply criticized the F.B.I. director. Among the officials who signed the letter was former Attorney General \uc2 Eric H. Holder Jr\uc2 ., with whom Mr. Comey often clashed before Mr. Holder left office in 2015.\par \par \uc2 Over the weekend, senior Justice Department officials, some of whom advised Mr. Comey not to make a public announcement about the emails, said that they would make all resources available to conduct the investigation as quickly as possible, and that the timing of the letter -- just days before the \uc2 election\uc2  -- gave the matter an unprecedented urgency.\par \par \uc2 Late Friday and early Saturday, law enforcement officials said there was no chance the email review could be completed before \uc2 Election\uc2  Day. By Sunday, officials said they would spare no resources in the investigation and try to determine whether the new emails changed the Justice Department's conclusion not to charge Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  or her aides.\par \par \uc2 The emails will be reviewed by the same counterintelligence team in Washington that handled the \uc2 Clinton\uc2  investigation from the beginning. The review will focus on whether there is evidence in the emails that Ms. Abedin mishandled classified information or impeded the F.B.I.'s original email investigation.\par \par \uc2 Investigators will also want to know whether the new trove includes messages that Ms. Abedin did not turn over to the F.B.I. months ago. Ms. Abedin has said she did not routinely delete emails, and people close to her said she did not know these emails were on Mr. Weiner's computers. It is not clear how they got there, but it is possible they were automatically backed up.\par \par \uc2 The Justice Department efforts were described by three federal law enforcement officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the case.\par \par \uc2 The F.B.I. knew weeks ago that its investigation into whether Mr. Weiner sent illicit text messages to a 15-year-old girl in North Carolina had the potential to reignite the \uc2 Clinton\uc2  case. After agents seized Mr. Weiner's laptop, phone and tablet on Oct. 3, they quickly learned the computer contained a trove of Ms. Abedin's emails.\par \par \uc2 The assistant F.B.I. director in charge of the New York field office then notified the deputy director in Washington about the discovery, according to one senior law enforcement official. Agents in the Weiner case were not allowed to widely search Ms. Abedin's emails, but were told to conduct a cursory review of the metadata -- the ''to'' and ''from'' information on each message -- to see if any of the emails could be relevant to the \uc2 Clinton\uc2  investigation.\par \par \uc2 Once it became clear that the emails were potentially significant, lawyers at the Justice Department and the F.B.I. conducted a legal analysis of how to proceed, officials said. Because Ms. Abedin's emails were not directly related to the investigation of her husband, criminal agents could neither read the contents of the emails nor pass them to their colleagues in Washington.\par \par \uc2 Late last week, the authorities decided to seek a search warrant to examine the emails. Mr. Comey's letter gave that effort a tremendous sense of urgency. Suddenly, a follow-up inquiry that was expected to take weeks or months now needed to be rushed before \uc2 Election\uc2  Day.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Comey's letter also opened him up to criticism from Democrats that he seemed willing to disclose every investigative wrinkle related to the \uc2 Clinton\uc2  investigation, but has not said anything about the scope of an F.B.I. investigation into Russian meddling in American elections. Democrats have repeatedly asked the F.B.I. to investigate Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  and his aides as part of that case. Mr. Comey has never said if he would.\par \par \uc2 Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the minority leader, increased the pressure on Mr. Comey late Sunday, criticizing the director for a ''disturbing double standard.''\par \par \uc2 ''In my communications with you and other top officials in the national security community, it has become clear that you possess explosive information about close ties and coordination between \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2 , his top advisers and the Russian government,'' Mr. Reid wrote in a letter to Mr. Comey. ''The public has a right to know this information.''\par \par \uc2 It was unclear what Mr. Reid was referring to. A spokesman said in a telephone interview Sunday that Mr. Reid did not believe it was his place to disclose national security information, which had been told to him in confidential briefings with senior intelligence and law enforcement officials.\par \par \uc2 ''The exact information is at the discretion of the national security community, but it is Senator Reid's view that there is much more that can be said publicly than has been so far,'' said the spokesman, Adam Jentleson.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Comey and his allies have defended his handling of the \uc2 Clinton\uc2  case, calling the circumstances ''exceptional.''\par \par \uc2 Though Justice Department guidelines discourage making public comments about continuing investigations or doing anything that could influence an \uc2 election\uc2 , Mr. Comey has said he believed that he was obligated to reveal the existence of the new emails. Not telling Congress, he told colleagues, would have opened up the F.B.I. to criticism and created a cloud that would have hung over the bureau for years.\par \par \uc2 Document NYTF000020161031ecav0004c\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 National Desk; SECTA\par \b \uc2 10 Questions (and Answers) About the New Email Trove\b0\par\par\uc2 By MICHAEL S. SCHMIDT and MATT APUZZO; Jonathan Martin contributed reporting. \par \uc2 1,601 \uc2 words\par \uc2 31 October 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 15\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 WASHINGTON -- Just days before \uc2 Election\uc2  Day, and with voters in many states already going to the polls, the F.B.I. director made a stunning announcement on Friday: Agents had discovered new emails that might be relevant to the completed investigation into \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's private server, a case that she had seemingly put behind her in July.\par \par \uc2 Never in recent history has the F.B.I. been so enmeshed in a presidential race. With a vague 166-word statement to Congress, the F.B.I. sent jolts through the campaign, leaving many voters unsure what to make of a case involving national security secrets, a disgraced congressman, racy text messages and a dispute among the country's top law enforcement officers.\par \par \uc2 Here's what we know so far.\par \par \uc2 What happened on Friday?\par \par \uc2 The F.B.I. director, James B. Comey, sent a letter to Congress that said agents had uncovered new emails that could be connected to the \uc2 Clinton\uc2  investigation. That investigation had examined whether Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  and her aides had mishandled classified information by sending it through Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's private email server. The inquiry was completed in July with no charges filed.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Comey said on Friday that agents would review the new emails to see whether they contained classified information. The letter was sent 11 days before the presidential \uc2 election\uc2 , and it set off fierce criticism of Mr. Comey for appearing to meddle in politics.\par \par \uc2 The F.B.I. director's letter did not reopen the \uc2 Clinton\uc2  inquiry, though some Republicans, including \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , characterized the move that way. Agents could open a new inquiry if they find evidence that the earlier investigation had been impeded or that classified materials had been intentionally mishandled.\par \par \uc2 Where did these new emails come from?\par \par \uc2 Mr. Comey did not say in his letter. But law enforcement officials briefed on the investigation said that agents had discovered the emails on a laptop owned by Anthony D. Weiner, the disgraced former congressman and estranged husband of Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's top aide, Huma Abedin.\par \par \uc2 Last month, the F.B.I. began investigating allegations that Mr. Weiner had exchanged sexually explicit messages with a teenager. On Oct. 3, agents in New York executed a search warrant to obtain Mr. Weiner's iPhone, an iPad and the laptop. Searching the laptop, they found evidence of a trove of emails similar to ones that had been examined in the \uc2 Clinton\uc2  investigation.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Comey decided last week that agents should examine those emails to determine whether they contained national security information. That requires a court order, and officials said agents had not yet begun reading the emails.\par \par \uc2 Why does the F.B.I. care if there is classified information in the emails?\par \par \uc2 Under federal law, mishandling national security information is a crime, one that the F.B.I. is responsible for investigating. In 2015, the bureau began investigating the personal email account that Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  had used exclusively as secretary of state. As part of that investigation, the bureau tried to find every electronic device -- phones, tablets, computers -- that Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  and her aides used.\par \par \uc2 Agents could not find many of them, including several of Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's cellphones and two iPads. The agents knew that those devices, and others they were not aware of, might someday surface. But they completed the \uc2 Clinton\uc2  case because they found no evidence that anyone had intentionally broken the law.\par \par \uc2 The newly discovered emails may -- or may not -- provide new information to the F.B.I.\par \par \uc2 Why did Mr. Comey send the letter?\par \par \uc2 In July, Mr. Comey told Congress that the \uc2 Clinton\uc2  investigation was complete but that if new information came to light, the bureau would examine it. Mr. Comey pledged to be as transparent as he could with Congress about the investigation, and has since made public hundreds of pages of documents related to the inquiry.\par \par \uc2 According to senior F.B.I. officials, Mr. Comey felt that he would be breaking his pledge of transparency to Congress if he did not reveal the new information from the Weiner case. And he believed that the bureau would be accused of suppressing details to benefit Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  -- an accusation that he believed could do lasting damage to the F.B.I.'s credibility.\par \par \uc2 Who is upset with Mr. Comey for sending the letter?\par \par \uc2 Many Democrats and even some Republicans have called the letter vague, troubling and unprecedented. Senior officials at the Justice Department urged Mr. Comey not to send the letter, saying it violated the spirit of longstanding policies not to discuss current investigations or do anything that could be seen as meddling in an \uc2 election\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 In the letter, Mr. Comey said that the F.B.I. had yet to determine whether ''this material may be significant,'' and that he could not predict how long the review would take. Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's campaign has pushed Mr. Comey to release more information about the emails.\par \par \uc2 Her campaign chairman, \uc2 John D. Podesta\uc2 , said that ''by providing selective information, he has allowed partisans to distort and exaggerate to inflict maximum political damage.''\par \par \uc2 What does all of this mean for Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  and her campaign?\par \par \uc2 The short answer is that it is not yet clear. Polling on weekends can be unreliable, so it may be a few days before the effect of the development can be fully assessed. What is evident is that a campaign that has largely been a referendum on Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  -- particularly since the first debate -- is now not so clear-cut. The email development will certainly matter, but the question is just how much.\par \par \uc2 Twenty million people have already voted, and millions more have already determined whom they will support. The country was already politically polarized before this \uc2 election\uc2 , and opinions are overwhelmingly cemented about these two household-name nominees.\par \par \uc2 The email news could matter most in down-ballot races. After being on the defensive for weeks because of Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's behavior, Republican candidates now have a more helpful news media environment in which to make their closing arguments. And Republican voters who are otherwise demoralized may have been given one final nudge to show up to the polls.\par \par \uc2 What happens now?\par \par \uc2 In the coming days, the F.B.I. will begin conducting a smaller version of the larger investigation it completed in July. Agents will go through the emails found on the laptop to determine whether they contain classified information.\par \par \uc2 If so, the bureau will again look at the question of whether anyone intentionally committed a crime. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  campaign officials have said that Ms. Abedin gave the authorities all of the electronic devices that she believed had work-related emails on them. Many of the newly discovered messages are likely to be duplicates of others that the F.B.I. has already examined, investigators say. The review will be conducted by the same Washington-based F.B.I. agents who led the investigation into Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's emails. F.B.I. agents are all but certain that it will not be completed by \uc2 Election\uc2  Day, and believe it will take at least several weeks.\par \par \uc2 Neither Justice Department officials nor F.B.I. agents say they know what to expect from Mr. Comey over the coming days. Normally, investigations are conducted secretly, but Mr. Comey's public remarks have opened him up to demands from both campaigns that he make as much information public as possible as soon as it is available.\par \par \uc2 What's the worst-case scenario for Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  and her aides?\par \par \uc2 In July, Mr. Comey announced that the bureau had not found enough evidence to charge anyone with a crime for the mishandling of classified materials on Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's server. If the new emails indicate intentional efforts by her or her aides to move such information outside secure government systems, or if they tried to impede the earlier inquiry, the F.B.I. will most likely want to investigate further. But the bureau has just begun the process of combing through the new emails, and officials believe that at least some are duplicates of messages that have already been examined.\par \par \uc2 How rare is it for the F.B.I. to make a development like this public?\par \par \uc2 Extremely rare. At times during trials or after cases are closed, the F.B.I. finds new evidence and either discloses it to defense lawyers or reopens a case. An F.B.I. director has never made such a disclosure to Congress so close to a presidential \uc2 election\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 How did Attorney General Loretta Lynch and the Justice Department feel about Mr. Comey's letter?\par \par \uc2 Senior Justice Department officials tried to discourage Mr. Comey from sending the letter, saying that it would violate department guidelines that advise against talking about current criminal investigations or being seen as meddling in elections.\par \par \uc2 They urged Mr. Comey not to do anything before \uc2 Election\uc2  Day, and they said he should tell Congress when agents had read the emails, understood whether they were relevant and could put them in context. They stopped short, however, of issuing a direct order prohibiting him from sending the letter.\par \par \uc2 Find out what you need to know about the 2016 presidential race today, and get politics news updates via \uc2 Facebook\uc2 , \uc2 Twitter\uc2  and the First Draft newsletter.\par \par \uc2 James B.

\par\par \uc2 National Desk; SECTA\par \b \uc2 Clinton\uc2  Works to Keep \uc2 Trump\uc2  and Emails at Bay\b0\par\par\uc2 By ALEXANDER BURNS and THOMAS KAPLAN; Nick Corasaniti contributed reporting. \par \uc2 1,193 \uc2 words\par \uc2 31 October 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 14\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  worked to campaign past the revived controversy around her email server on Sunday, casting herself as a resilient fighter as \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2  intensified his sweeping claims of corruption in the American justice system.\par \par \uc2 The announcement by James B. Comey, the F.B.I. director, of a new review of emails that may be linked to Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  overshadowed the candidates' usual messages over the weekend. The news threw Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  and the \uc2 Trump\uc2  campaign into an unexpected debate over both her emails and Mr. Comey's conduct, though only scant information has been made public about the substance of the F.B.I.'s activities.\par \par \uc2 Campaigning in Florida, Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  appeared to group Mr. Comey's surprise role in the presidential race with the flurry of partisan attacks that often mark the last days of political campaigns. Without mentioning Mr. Comey by name, Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  struck a defiant note; at a nightclub in Wilton Manors, she invoked her mother's admonition to ''never, ever quit.''\par \par \uc2 ''We won't be distracted, no matter what our opponents throw at us,'' Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  said. ''We're not going to be knocked off course. We know how much this \uc2 election\uc2  matters, and we know how many people are counting on us.''\par \par \uc2 At a black church in Fort Lauderdale, Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  urged voters to turn out in force to vote in order to reject ''a negative, hateful, bigoted vision'' on the other side of the race.\par \par \uc2 If Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  has aimed to stifle interest in her emails, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  has seized on Mr. Comey's announcement with exuberant glee.\par \par \uc2 At a rally on Sunday in Colorado, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  called the disclosure a ''big bombshell'' and predicted it would lift him in the polls.\par \par \uc2 Having spent months criticizing both Mr. Comey and the Department of Justice for deciding not to press charges against Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  for her use of a private email server, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  redirected his attack on Sunday, going after Attorney General Loretta Lynch.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  accused Ms. Lynch of corruption for failing to indict Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , claiming without evidence that Ms. Lynch had likely interfered with an investigation in the hope of retaining her job in a \uc2 Clinton\uc2  administration.\par \par \uc2 ''Effectively, you'd call that a bribe, wouldn't you?'' Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  asked at a speech in Las Vegas.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's closest advisers stopped well short of his provocative claim. But on the Sunday news programs, allies of Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , including his running mate, \uc2 Gov. Mike Pence\uc2  of Indiana, attempted to sow deeper doubts about Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's trustworthiness without explicitly attacking the justice system.\par \par \uc2 Still, both sides -- having scant information about what, exactly, Mr. Comey's new review might entail -- offered more insinuations than arguments with \uc2 Election\uc2  Day just nine days away.\par \par \uc2 The code word for Mr. Pence was ''troubled'' -- a term he used freely on television to raise the notion, if not quite an accusation, that prosecutors had gone easy on Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 ''I'm one of millions of Americans that were troubled by that -- why there's this double standard when it comes to the Clintons,'' Mr. Pence said on ''Meet the Press'' on \uc2 NBC\uc2 . ''I mean, no one is above the law.''\par \par \uc2 And for Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's allies, the word of the day was ''puzzled'' -- the descriptor top \uc2 Clinton\uc2  surrogates wielded repeatedly as they implied, without quite saying, that Mr. Comey had staged an unforgivable political intervention late in the presidential race.\par \par \uc2 ''It's just extremely puzzling,'' said Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia, Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's running mate, on ''This Week'' on ABC. ''I just have no way of understanding these actions. They're completely unprecedented and that's why I think he owes the American public more information.''\par \par \uc2 The stakes of the clash, muddled as it is, are plainly higher for Democrats: Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  had led consistently in polls ahead of Mr. Comey's announcement, and appeared close to having a firm lock on the 270 Electoral College votes required for victory. Only a late plot twist, it seemed, might be capable of undoing her advantage.\par \par \uc2 It is unclear whether Mr. Comey's actions could amount to such an unforeseen turn. Mr. Comey, who notified Congress on Friday that information from a separate case prompted the fresh review of Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's emails, has not offered any additional comment on the matter.\par \par \uc2 Government officials have described the F.B.I.'s new information as emerging from an investigation into allegations that Anthony D. Weiner, a former congressman married to Huma Abedin, one of Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's closest aides, exchanged sexually themed messages with a teenager.\par \par \uc2 Clinton\uc2  allies repeatedly accused Mr. Comey of breaching Justice Department protocols by commenting on a confidential inquiry so close to an \uc2 election\uc2 , and expressed bewilderment at his conduct.\par \par \uc2 Robby Mook, Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's campaign manager, adopted the same phrasing, describing the campaign as ''so puzzled'' by Mr. Comey's actions. He lamented that Mr. Comey had opened the floodgates to wild speculation by offering such a nonspecific announcement.\par \par \uc2 ''The issue here is, if he doesn't come out and get all the information on the table, he's going to let anyone -- any conspiracy theory -- take the day,'' Mr. Mook said on ''Meet the Press.''\par \par \uc2 But Mr. Mook said he did not expect the F.B.I. director's unusual action to cost Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  the \uc2 election\uc2 . On the contrary, Mr. Mook said Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  was faring well in early voting and could lock down one or more swing states, starting with Nevada, before \uc2 Election\uc2  Day.\par \par \uc2 A smattering of new polling information released on Sunday painted a mixed picture of the race in its final days, with Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  consistently holding an advantage but of uncertain size. It is likely too soon to see any direct effect from Friday's events, casting additional uncertainty over the importance of the latest revelations.\par \par \uc2 Still, an ABC News/Washington Post tracking poll showed Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's advantage nationally slipping to just one percentage point, in a dramatic narrowing over the past week. And a New York Times/Siena College poll showed Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  retaking the lead in Florida.\par \par \uc2 But polling from NBC News and The Wall Street Journal, conducted by \uc2 Marist College\uc2 , found Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  faring better in Florida, ahead of Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  there by one point, and leading him by six points in North Carolina.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  is spending several of the few days left in the race campaigning well outside the traditional band of states that decide presidential elections. He was campaigning on Sunday in New Mexico and plans on Monday to be in Michigan -- two solidly blue states where polling has shown Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  with a clear lead.\par \par \uc2 Find out what you need to know about the 2016 presidential race today, and get politics news updates via \uc2 Facebook\uc2 , \uc2 Twitter\uc2  and the First Draft newsletter.\par \par \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  attracted the attention of a young girl during a campaign stop on Sunday in Pompano Beach, Fla.

\par\par \uc2 National Desk; SECTA\par \b \uc2 Democrats See a Turnout Edge in Swing States\b0\par\par\uc2 By JEREMY W. PETERS and MATT FLEGENHEIMER; Yamiche Alcindor, Jack Healy and Thomas Kaplan contributed reporting. \par \uc2 1,581 \uc2 words\par \uc2 31 October 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 1\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  has established a slim edge over \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2  in early-voter turnout in several vital swing states, pressing her longstanding advantages in state-level organization and potentially mitigating the fallout from her campaign's latest scrap with the F.B.I.\par \par \uc2 Even as Democrats continued to reel from revived questions about Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's use of a private email server as secretary of state -- a jolt delivered 11 days before the \uc2 election\uc2  in an abstruse letter from the F.B.I. director, James B. Comey -- turnout tallies and interviews with dozens of early voters suggest that even a vintage ''October surprise'' may pack less of a punch than it once did.\par \par \uc2 In a race between two deeply polarizing candidates, opinions appear to have been cemented weeks if not months ago for most voters. And the contest is well underway in some of the most important battlegrounds.\par \par \uc2 At least 21 million people have voted so far across the country. In the states that are most likely to decide the \uc2 election\uc2  -- among them Florida, Colorado and Nevada -- close to a quarter of the electorate has already cast ballots. While their votes will not be counted until \uc2 Election\uc2  Day, registered Democrats are outperforming Republicans in key demographics and urban areas there and in North Carolina, where extensive in-person voting began late last week and which has emerged as one of the most closely contested battlegrounds for the White House and control of the Senate.\par \par \uc2 Now, the salient question appears to be whether an unforeseen plot twist in the campaign's final days can still upend an \uc2 election\uc2  that is already over for millions of voters.\par \par \uc2 Though Democrats can take solace from the fact that their large organizational advantage has supplied a cushion when they need it most, the race is still exceedingly close. And the latest eruption in the email affair still threatens to turn many voters against Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  -- and put Democrats in lower-level contests on the defensive -- just when it appeared Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  and other Republican candidates were falling out of contention.\par \par \uc2 ''We cannot get distracted by all the noise in the political environment,'' Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  urged voters on Sunday in Fort Lauderdale, Fla. reminding them that three million Floridians had already voted. ''We've got to stay focused.''\par \par \uc2 While the early-voting numbers appear strong for Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , there were signs of weakness over the weekend, especially among African-Americans in North Carolina, where the turnout as of Saturday night showed that they had not voted at their 2012 levels so far.\par \par \uc2 Among both supporters and critics of Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , early returns suggest the latest uproar has changed few minds, despite seeming to break through the campaign din. In interviews with more than three dozen voters in three early-voting states -- Colorado, Florida and North Carolina -- most had at least a passing familiarity with the email developments but said the news had no bearing on their decisions at the ballot box.\par \par \uc2 ''Enough is enough with the emails,'' said Marialuisa Glait, 33, of Miami, holding her 2-year-old son, Joaquin, after voting for Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Fernando Gonzales, 26, another early \uc2 Clinton\uc2  voter in Miami, said this consistently implausible \uc2 election\uc2  season had long ago deadened his nerves to shock.\par \par \uc2 ''The October surprise doesn't mean anything,'' he said. ''The bar's been lowered so much, you can't lower it any more.''\par \par \uc2 Because of a large advantage in mail-in ballots, registered Republicans in Florida have the thinnest of edges over registered Democrats in votes cast so far -- less than a percentage point. But that advantage has diminished as in-person voting has begun and is smaller than the lead Republicans had at this point four years ago. The Democratic gains owe in large part to high turnout among Hispanics, who have typically waited until much later to vote.\par \par \uc2 ''Hispanics are outperforming,'' said Daniel A. Smith, a political science professor at the University of Florida who has been analyzing demographic data about early turnout that the state is required to collect. ''They are more engaged in this \uc2 election\uc2  cycle, and more are voting earlier than we saw in 2012.''\par \par \uc2 In North Carolina, Democrats have a wide lead in the number of ballots cast so far, with 43 percent to Republicans' 31 percent. But because the state significantly curtailed early voting, Democrats have lagged behind their 2012 participation rate, while Republicans are running ahead. As more polling places open, Democrats are catching up to their 2012 rates.\par \par \uc2 ''They keep eating that deficit away,'' said J. Michael Bitzer, a professor of political science at Catawba College.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Bitzer said there are other warning signs for Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 : Women have cast 56 percent of the votes in North Carolina so far, and rural voters are slightly behind their 2012 participation rates.\par \par \uc2 The nagging question for Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  is whether Democrats can bolster black turnout, which is down 17 percent so far, Mr. Bitzer said. ''That's the biggest concern for her,'' he added.\par \par \uc2 Democrats are also beating Republicans so far in Colorado and Nevada, where Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  held rallies over the weekend and continued to question the integrity of the voting process, even as he implored his supporters to send in their ballots.\par \par \uc2 ''Do you think those ballots are properly counted? Do you think?'' Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  said on Sunday in Greeley, Colo. Thirty-nine percent of the ballots received in Colorado so far have been from registered Democrats, 35 percent from Republicans. Democrats overcame Republicans' longstanding registration advantage there this year, a worrisome sign for Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  and his party.\par \par \uc2 In Nevada, where Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  campaigned on Sunday, Democrats were voting at a rate that exceeded Republicans' participation by seven percentage points. Crucially, in bellwether Washoe County, which includes Reno, more Democrats had voted as of late Saturday.\par \par \uc2 Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  and her allies are directing their campaign visits almost exclusively to early-voting states: On Saturday, Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  appeared with Jennifer Lopez at a concert in Miami. Former President \uc2 Bill \uc2 Clinton\uc2  appeared on Sunday in North Carolina, and Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  was to campaign on Monday in Ohio. Her goal, aides said, is to build an advantage Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  cannot overcome even if he wins the majority of votes cast on \uc2 Election\uc2  Day.\par \par \uc2 By contrast, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's minimal organizing has essentially left voter mobilization efforts to the \uc2 Republican National Committee\uc2 . Officials there expressed confidence despite having a far larger role than they had anticipated.\par \par \uc2 ''We're seeing some very positive metrics,'' said Chris Carr, the committee's political director. ''I would say we're running at parity or ahead of the \uc2 Clinton\uc2  campaign.''\par \par \uc2 Both campaigns have embarked on an intense chase for their supporters who are least likely to vote -- people who could hold the key to the \uc2 election\uc2 . If these people turn out, then early voting actually adds to Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's or Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's vote totals. Otherwise the effect of early voting would be relatively meaningless: People would have voted anyway, just at a different time.\par \par \uc2 Clinton\uc2  aides said they had created a battleground-state model that scores voters based on factors such as their likelihood of voting and their susceptibility to advertising. So far, among those the \uc2 Clinton\uc2  campaign sees as least likely to turn out -- people who have skipped nonpresidential elections -- Democrats are voting in far greater numbers than Republicans in both North Carolina and Nevada, and in slightly larger numbers in Arizona.\par \par \uc2 The F.B.I.'s disclosure on Friday, rather than changing many minds, seemed to largely confirm the sentiments of people who were voting early.\par \par \uc2 ''If I was a Democrat, I'd certainly be questioning my vote,'' said Steve Flynn, a 65-year-old retired construction worker who lives outside Denver and voted for Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 But his daughter-in-law, Whitney Dorman, said she and her husband would still be likely to cast their votes for Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 ''I really don't care,'' said Ms. Dorman, 31, a graphic designer. ''Is she in people's pockets? Sure, why not.''\par \par \uc2 T.J. Blazer, 44, who said he had voted for Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  in St. Petersburg, Fla., said he was taken aback by what he viewed as an admission by the F.B.I. that it had mishandled Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's case.\par \par \uc2 At least as disorienting, he said, was the return of Anthony D. Weiner to his television -- a turn that seemed to confirm everything already so odd about this \uc2 election\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 ''Next thing I know, his picture popped up,'' he said. ''Where did he come from?''\par \par \uc2 Find out what you need to know about the 2016 presidential race today, and get politics news updates via \uc2 Facebook\uc2 , \uc2 Twitter\uc2  and the First Draft newsletter.\par \par \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  visiting an early-voting site on Sunday in Pompano Beach, Fla.

Sign Trade Deal\b0\par\par\uc2 By JAMES KANTER \par \uc2 1,034 \uc2 words\par \uc2 31 October 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 3\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 BRUSSELS -- The \uc2 European Union\uc2  and Canada signed a far-reaching trade agreement on Sunday that commits them to opening their markets to greater competition, after overcoming a last-minute political obstacle that reflected the growing skepticism toward globalization in much of the developed world.\par \par \uc2 Canada's prime minister, \uc2 Justin Trudeau\uc2 , had been forced to call off an earlier trip to sign the deal after Wallonia, the French-speaking region of Belgium, used its veto to withhold Belgium's approval of the deal. The pact required the support of all 28 \uc2 European Union\uc2  countries.\par \par \uc2 On Friday, Wallonia, which has been hit hard by deindustrialization and feared greater agricultural competition, withdrew its veto after concessions were made by the Belgian government, including promises to protect farmers. Hours later, the \uc2 European Union\uc2  announced that the deal was back on track.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Trudeau signed the pact on Sunday, joined by Donald Tusk, the president of the European Council, which represents the leaders of the member states; Prime Minister Robert Fico of Slovakia, which holds the rotating presidency of the body that runs the bloc's ministerial meetings; and \uc2 Jean-Claude Juncker\uc2 , the president of the European Commission, the bloc's executive arm.\par \par \uc2 The deal will help to demonstrate that ''trade is good for the middle class and those working hard to join it,'' Mr. Trudeau said at a news conference in Brussels. Mr. Trudeau said he wanted to ''make sure that everyone gets that this is a good thing for our economies but it's also a good example to the world.''\par \par \uc2 But the Walloon intransigence has underlined the extent to which trade has become politically radioactive as citizens increasingly blame globalization for growing disparities in wealth and living standards. Across Europe and the United States, opposition to trade has become a rallying point for populist movements on the left and the right, threatening to upend the established political order.\par \par \uc2 A compromise among the regions of Belgium, which persuaded Wallonia to drop its veto, called for language to clarify the handling of trade complaints brought by Canadian or European companies.\par \par \uc2 Belgium pledged to refer the arbitration system to the \uc2 Court of Justice of the European Union\uc2 , where judges can assess its legality.\par \par \uc2 Nonetheless, several dozen anti-trade activists held a rowdy protest on Sunday outside the building where Mr. Trudeau signed the pact, the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement. The protesters splashed red paint on the forecourt of the building and condemned a planned Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership between Europe and the United States.\par \par \uc2 That much larger deal, known as T.T.I.P., has already stalled amid opposition from large numbers of Europeans, including many Germans and Austrians. The protesters see the Canadian deal as a warm-up for a much larger battle.\par \par \uc2 The spectacle of tiny Wallonia, with just 3.6 million people, holding up a deal that affects more than 500 million Europeans and 35 million Canadians and prompting \uc2 European Union\uc2  leaders to delay a summit meeting has rattled Western leaders.\par \par \uc2 ''In the end, people who favor free trade survived to fight another day,'' said Jacob Funk Kirkegaard, a senior fellow at the \uc2 Peterson Institute for International Economics\uc2  in Washington.\par \par \uc2 ''Now that we see the Canadian deal has made it over the finish line, the Atlantic trade deal still has a fighting chance,'' he said. ''But it won't be easy. T.T.I.P. could similarly threaten traditional farming interests and arouse knee-jerk European suspicions about common trans-Atlantic health and environmental standards.''\par \par \uc2 As a legal matter, the member states' legislatures still need to ratify the Canadian agreement. That could mean more hiccups before it goes into effect.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Tusk, of the European Council, said he was cautiously optimistic that the deal would survive the ratification process and could send a positive message about globalization.\par \par \uc2 ''Today's decisions demonstrate that the disintegration of the Western community does not need to become a lasting trend,'' Mr. Tusk said. ''Free trade and globalization have protected hundreds of millions of people from poverty and hunger. The problem is that few people believe this.''\par \par \uc2 ''The \uc2 European Union\uc2  is not yet in the group of hard protectionist and state-controlled economies like China or Russia,'' said Hosuk Lee-Makiyama, the director of the European Center for International Political Economy, a research organization in Brussels. ''Instead, the E.U. is carving out a new middle ground between those two countries and the United States.''\par \par \uc2 Europe, Mr. Lee-Makiyama said, is pivoting to a position as ''neither an ally of East nor West.''\par \par \uc2 Once ratified, the Canadian deal would cut many tariffs on industrial goods and on farm and food items, according to the \uc2 European Commission\uc2 . The deal also would open up the services sector in areas like cargo shipping, maritime services and finance to European firms, the commission said.\par \par \uc2 The Canadian deal is also regarded by trade advocates as a template for advanced, industrial economies by making it easier for their regulators to recognize one another's rules, and by updating the rules on how companies can make sure governments protect their investments.\par \par \uc2 If the Obama administration has its way, the next major regional trade accord to make it over the finish line will be the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which includes the United States, Canada, Japan and Vietnam.\par \par \uc2 The Pacific deal -- largely because it involves a number of emerging economies -- is a more traditional trade accord aimed mainly at cutting tariffs and knocking down impediments to trade.\par \par \uc2 But like the Europeans, many Americans do not want to make concessions that would lower wages or threaten jobs at home. The Asia-Pacific deal has become a hot issue in the United States presidential \uc2 election\uc2 ; both major-party nominees, \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  and \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , oppose it.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Funk Kirkegaard, the senior fellow at the Peterson Institute, said he gave the Pacific deal about a 30 percent chance of being concluded while President Obama is still in office. ''Beyond January,'' he said, ''it's all dependent on the results of the \uc2 election\uc2  and who's the next president.''\par \par \uc2 Follow James Kanter on Twitter @jameskanter.\par \par \uc2 Document NYTF000020161031ecav00040\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 OP-ED CONTRIBUTOR\par \uc2 Editorial Desk; SECTA\par \b \uc2 Witchcraft on the Campaign Trail\b0\par\par\uc2 By STACY SCHIFF \par \uc2 961 \uc2 words\par \uc2 31 October 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 21\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 The idea has been flying about for a while now, at least since the summer's cries to lock up or hang the Democratic presidential candidate. Earlier on, Ben Carson helpfully linked her to Lucifer. After the first debate, Rush Limbaugh made the designation official: In a double-barreled attack, he declared that \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  came off ''exactly as many people see her -- a witch with a capital 'B.'''\par \par \uc2 A conservative editor recently begged his readers not to elect Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 ; were she to land in the White House, his health would deteriorate. She would upset his stomach. She would shorten his life. He sounded steeped in witchcraft texts. Those are classic symptoms of enchantment -- in the pre-Enlightenment world.\par \par \uc2 As we dust off the broomsticks and pointy hats, it seems fair to ask what exactly we mean by a witch these days.\par \par \uc2 In some respects the 21st-century witch -- someone who is one because others insist she is, not because she identifies as a Wiccan priestess -- closely resembles her early American forebears. A Maine police officer in a ''Hillary for prison'' T-shirt succinctly defined the term at a September rally: ''An angry, crotchety old hag who is just out for power, who just wants to be able to line her pockets.''\par \par \uc2 When sorcery arrived on these shores, when New Englanders hanged witches, they worked in part from that stereotype. Witches could enchant rope, cause fences to disappear, make stomachs lurch with a glance, transform themselves into balls of fire, disturb their neighbors' dreams. They might also appear shrill, vindictive or calculating, three adjectives that the conservative editor rallied last week when he implored readers to spare him ''four years of this witch as president.''\par \par \uc2 The early modern American understood a witch to be a confederate of the devil; he took literally the biblical command: ''Though shalt not suffer the witch to live.'' He was also more egalitarian than we are. For him, ''witch'' was a gender-neutral term. He condemned enterprising ship captains along with muttering, menopausal malcontents. And he was more creative: In the course of the Salem witch trials, men and women stood accused for a whole catalog of reasons. (Running for political office may actually have figured among them: A rich merchant was accused weeks after he had been elected a Salem selectman.) The uncommonly strong or unaccountably smart raised suspicions. Indeed, a witch often committed the capital crime of displaying more wit than her neighbors, as was said of the third woman to hang in Massachusetts, in 1656.\par \par \uc2 Halloween provides the modern witch with her bread and butter; what sustains her are our fears. We have many more tools than did the 17th-century villager to make sense of our world, chemistry, physics, biology and guilty consciences among them. But misfortune continues to perplex and provoke us. Our stomachs still lurch. Any number of things disturb us in the night.\par \par \uc2 Witches remain in business so long as we feel powerless: They offer the blessed relief of assigning blame; they allow us to distill spite, that heady brew of vindication and humiliation. We may consider ourselves more enlightened than the Peruvian villagers who last month burned a woman alive, or than the rural Ghanaians who banish spell-casting women to primitive witch colonies. But we still have few other names for the way a woman's voice unsettles, for the queasy sense that the world must be upside-down if she happens to be running it. \uc2 Nancy Pelosi\uc2 's Republican challenger portrayed her as the Wicked Witch of the West in a 2010 ad. (He melted her in the TV spot, though not in the \uc2 election\uc2 .) An older woman moreover knows things a younger woman does not; she can say things a younger woman says with difficulty. Like no.\par \par \uc2 At the heart of the matter is a paradox: For centuries women were assumed to be more susceptible to Satan's advances because of their inherent frailty. At the same time they exercise unnatural power on two fronts. The witch has retired her religious affiliation. But as your dictionary will tell you, she survives as a hybrid of two disturbing creatures: the vocal old hag, and the alluring young vixen.\par \par \uc2 The idea may have evolved; the animus remains. And while the religious piece has fallen away, the demonic talk has returned. The alt-right commentator Alex Jones has deemed Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  ''an abject, psychopathic demon from Hell that as soon as she gets into power is going to destroy the planet.'' In doing so he revealed something else about witchcraft: Witches tend to be people we didn't like in the first place. They appear suspect in advance of their crimes.\par \par \uc2 At least some of us can take comfort in the fact that we have tamed many of our fears. Otherwise we might hear the kind of reckless accusation the 1692 witchcraft court did when a blunt, boastful, perversely contentious man came before it. Thrice married, he guarded his secrets closely. He made outsize promises; he threatened and insulted. He broke rank with his establishment peers. He emerged unscathed from a series of savage attacks. Under interrogation, he made an art of ''tergiversations, contradictions, and falsehoods.'' Among his wizardly feats: He manipulated a very heavy gun despite surprisingly small hands. He was clearly a superhuman mastermind, the most formidable of witches, ''the ringleader of them all.'' His trial was the one everyone awaited. He was hanged in Salem that August.\par \par \uc2 Prepare yourself for a storm of witchcraft when a woman alights on Pennsylvania Avenue.\par \par \uc2 Stacy Schiff is the author of ''Cleopatra'' and ''The Witches: Suspicion, Betrayal and Hysteria in 1692 Salem.''\par \par \uc2 DRAWING (DRAWING BY BEN JONES) \par \par \uc2 Document NYTF000020161031ecav0003o\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

BLOW \par \uc2 925 \uc2 words\par \uc2 31 October 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 21\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Who would have thought that the final leg of this \uc2 election\uc2  cycle would be dominated by crowing about violating vaginas and by probes into penis pictures?\par \par \uc2 But even that frame is problematic because it creates an equivalency that doesn't exist. One scandal is about a man boasting of predation and the other is about a woman weary of people's prying. These are fundamentally different flaws, one being clearly about a pattern of assault and the other about a pattern of ill-fated insularity.\par \par \uc2 And yet an utterly irresponsible media, thirsty for a scoop and ignoring the consequences of its scope, has egged on a public with a scandal lust, aiding and abetting Republicans in turning an email mistake into a colossal crime.\par \par \uc2 Far from the faux \uc2 election\uc2  rigging that \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  has been harping on for weeks, this \uc2 election\uc2  isn't in danger of being stolen by \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , but in danger of being stolen from her.\par \par \uc2 On Friday, the F.B.I. director, James Comey, took the outrageous and unprecedented step of sending a letter to Congress announcing that the bureau has ''learned of the existence of emails that appear to be pertinent'' to the inquiry into \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's personal email server that apparently had been uncovered as part of an Anthony Weiner sexting investigation.\par \par \uc2 Not only was this move reckless, weaponizing the reputation of the bureau once again as a partisan political entity, but also Comey was apparently ignoring the strong discouragement of the Justice Department.\par \par \uc2 But, according to a report by The \uc2 New York Times\uc2 : ''Senior Justice Department officials did not move to stop him from sending the letter, officials said, but they did everything short of it, pointing to policies against talking about current criminal investigations or being seen as meddling in elections.''\par \par \uc2 Comey, for his part, appeared fully cognizant of how disruptive to the \uc2 election\uc2  his note would be, and yet inexplicably, he sent it anyway.\par \par \uc2 In a letter to F.B.I. employees, he pointed out that ''of course, we don't ordinarily tell Congress about ongoing investigations,'' but feebly tried to explain that he was doing so this time, at this crucial moment, so as not to mislead the American people and to ''supplement the record.''\par \par \uc2 Then he wrote: ''At the same time, however, given that we don't know the significance of this newly discovered collection of emails, I don't want to create a misleading impression. In trying to strike that balance, in a brief letter and in the middle of an \uc2 election\uc2  season, there is significant risk of being misunderstood, but I wanted you to hear directly from me about it.''\par \par \uc2 ''Risk of being misunderstood'' is one of the most appalling understatements of this presidential cycle. Comey clearly knew that his ill-advised actions could implicate \uc2 Clinton\uc2  by insinuation and he proceeded anyway, presenting his vague letter as an act of valor when in fact it was an act of vacuity. The irony here is that the man who blasted \uc2 Clinton\uc2  for being ''extremely careless'' for her use of a private email server was himself ''extremely careless'' for inserting himself and his agency into an \uc2 election\uc2  with that letter.\par \par \uc2 And let's be clear: Although there have been contradictory news reports on how many new emails there are in question and whether or not any of them were sent to or from \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , Comey himself did not and has not clarified any of these questions.\par \par \uc2 How are voters supposed to fold this into their decision-making with a little more than a week left before \uc2 Election\uc2  Day? Is this a big deal about nothing or another phase in something substantial?\par \par \uc2 Republicans may be gleeful, but Democrats have every right to be livid. This is just the latest lifeline being thrown to a Republican candidate drowning in his own ineptitude.\par \par \uc2 There is no way to know what electoral impact this will have, but I would venture that it is safe to say that it will have some. Headlines and sound bites are as deep as some voters go. The impropriety of Comey's action requires a level of detailed assessment that is simply beyond the inclination of what I roughly call the Fickle Five Percent, the late-deciding swing voters who move between candidates based on the week's revelations.\par \par \uc2 Add to that the fact that \uc2 Trump\uc2  has been encouraging his supporters to watch the polls in ''certain areas,'' a move that many worry could amount to voter intimidation, particularly in minority neighborhoods.\par \par \uc2 Furthermore, a senior \uc2 Trump\uc2  campaign official last week told Bloomberg Business Week, ''We have three major voter suppression operations underway.'' As the publication pointed out: ''They're aimed at three groups \uc2 Clinton\uc2  needs to win overwhelmingly: idealistic white liberals, young women, and African-Americans.''\par \par \uc2 Trump\uc2  wants to win through sleight of hand and Comey most likely just increased that possibility, however slightly. Voters of all ideologies who value the integrity of our electoral process must send the strongest possible message that this is not how we want our democracy to operate. They must vote with conviction in absolute opposition.\par \par \uc2 I invite you to join me on \uc2 Facebook\uc2  and follow me on Twitter (@CharlesMBlow), or email me at chblow@nytimes.com.\par \par \uc2 Follow The \uc2 New York Times\uc2  Opinion section on \uc2 Facebook\uc2  and Twitter (@NYTopinion), and sign up for the Opinion Today newsletter.\par \par \uc2 CHART: Impact of Emails (Source: Associated Press-GfK Poll, conducted Oct. 20-24, 2016.) \par \par \uc2 Document NYTF000020161031ecav0003v\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 THE WEEK AHEAD\par \uc2 Business/Financial Desk; SECTB\par \b \uc2 Last Pre-Vote Jobs Report and a Meeting of the Fed\b0\par\par\uc2 By THE NEW YORK TIMES \par \uc2 907 \uc2 words\par \uc2 31 October 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 2\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Here's a look at what's coming up this week:\par \par \uc2 ECONOMY\par \par \uc2 Eurozone estimates are for solid growth.\par \par \uc2 Official estimates coming out Monday are expected to show that the eurozone economy grew solidly in the third quarter as the region gradually emerges from nearly a decade of malaise. Analysts at Oxford Economics estimate that the gross domestic product in the eurozone rose 0.4 percent from the previous quarter, led by Germany and a recovering Spain. Although unemployment remains above 10 percent in the 19 countries of the eurozone, inflation is picking up from dangerously low levels, and surveys show that consumers and businesses are becoming more optimistic. ''The wider European economy actually looks in pretty good shape,'' Oxford Economics said in a note to clients last week. \uc2 Jack Ewing\par \par \uc2 Eyes are on personal income and spending data.\par \par \uc2 On Monday, the Commerce Department is set to report data on personal income and spending in September. Economists are looking for a 0.4 percentage point rise in each, with income buoyed by a still-healthy labor market. A bigger gain in income and spending than the consensus might set off alarm bells among traders who have been eyeing rising bond yields and expect the \uc2 Federal Reserve\uc2  to raise interest rates in December. A weaker number would suggest the economy was not as strong as recent data has indicated. Nelson D. Schwartz\par \par \uc2 BANKING INDUSTRY\par \par \uc2 Major European banks to report results.\par \par \uc2 Investors will once again be focused on Europe's banking sector as several of the region's biggest banks -- \uc2 Credit Suisse\uc2 , Soci\u233\'00\'E9t\u233\'00\'E9 G\u233\'00\'E9n\u233\'00\'E9rale of France and \uc2 Standard Chartered\uc2 , which is based in Britain but generates much of its revenue in Asia -- are expected to report their third-quarter results. Their results come as \uc2 Deutsche Bank\uc2  reported last week that it returned to a profit in the third quarter, providing some relief to investors after concerns about its stability. The bank is negotiating a settlement with the \uc2 United States Justice Department\uc2  in a case involving its underwriting of residential mortgage-backed securities. Chad Bray\par \par \uc2 ECONOMY\par \par \uc2 Fed to meet, but rate most likely to stay put.\par \par \uc2 Federal Reserve\uc2  officials insist that their meeting on Tuesday and Wednesday in Washington will be like any other Fed meeting. They will look at economic conditions and decide whether the time has come to raise interest rates. This is a polite fiction. It's a safe bet that the Fed will not raise rates until after the presidential \uc2 election\uc2 . The economic consequences of the \uc2 election\uc2  are uncertain; the politics are fraught, and even proponents of a rate increase have said they do not see much difference in waiting a few more weeks. The Fed may use its post-meeting statement to prepare investors for higher rates in December at its final meeting of the year. Binyamin Appelbaum\par \par \uc2 Bank of England\uc2  to report an updated inflation forecast.\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 Bank of England\uc2  will announce its latest monetary policy decision and unveil its updated forecast for inflation on Thursday. A news conference by \uc2 Mark Carney\uc2 , the Bank of England governor, is to follow. The Monetary Policy Committee is widely expected to keep interest rates steady as the British economy has performed better than expected since Britain's vote to leave the \uc2 European Union\uc2  in June. The Office of National Statistics said last week that Britain's economy grew at a 0.5 percent rate from July through September. That was down from an increase of 0.7 percent in gross domestic product from April to June, but ahead of economists' predictions.\par \par \uc2 In August, the central bank cut its benchmark interest rate to 0.25 percent, the lowest level in its 322-year history, and expanded other measures to bolster Britain's economy over fears that the so-called Brexit decision could weigh on growth. The rate had remained steady at 0.5 percent since March 2009. Chad Bray\par \par \uc2 Final jobs report before \uc2 Election\uc2  Day.\par \par \uc2 On Friday, the Labor Department is scheduled to release its report on the nation's hiring and unemployment for October. This snapshot of the economy will be the last before Americans go to the polls on \uc2 Election\uc2  Day. In September, employers reported adding 156,000 jobs -- a showing that the Republican nominee, \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , called ''a terrible jobs report'' in the third presidential debate. Economists did not have quite as dire a view. The jobs engine is not roaring with as much energy as it has over the last five years, when monthly job growth on average surpassed 200,000, but with the unemployment rate down to 5 percent, job creation was expected to slow.\par \par \uc2 A recent report from the \uc2 Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco\uc2  stated that monthly gains of 50,000 to 110,000 should be sufficient to keep the labor market healthy. Nonetheless, many Americans are working part time or for low wages or have become disheartened enough to drop out of the labor force altogether. Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's complaints resonate among these groups and others anxious about the future. A strong report for October, by contrast, could be used by \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  to bolster her argument that the Democrats are best positioned to build on the job gains seen during the Obama administration. Patricia Cohen\par \par \uc2 Credit Suisse is expected to report results this week.

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 The surprise disclosure that agents from the \uc2 Federal Bureau of Investigation\uc2  are taking a new look at \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's email use lays bare, just days before the \uc2 election\uc2 , tensions inside the bureau and the Justice Department over how to investigate the Democratic presidential nominee.\par \par \uc2 Investigators found 650,000 emails on a laptop that they believe was used by former Rep. Anthony Weiner and his estranged wife Huma Abedin, a close \uc2 Clinton\uc2  aide, and underlying metadata suggests thousands of those messages could have been sent to or from the private server that Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  used while she was secretary of state, according to people familiar with the matter.\par \par \uc2 It will take weeks, at a minimum, to determine whether those messages are work-related from the time Ms. Abedin served with Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  at the State Department; how many are duplicates of emails already reviewed by the \uc2 FBI\uc2 ; and whether they include either classified information or important new evidence in the \uc2 Clinton\uc2  email probe.\par \par \uc2 Officials had to await a court order to begin reviewing the emails -- which they received over the weekend, according to a person familiar with the matter -- because they were uncovered in an unrelated probe of Mr. Weiner.\par \par \uc2 The new investigative effort, disclosed by FBI Director James Comey on Friday, shows a bureau at times in sharp internal disagreement over matters related to the Clintons, and how to handle those matters fairly and carefully in the middle of a national \uc2 election\uc2  campaign. Even as the probe of Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's email use wound down in July, internal disagreements within the bureau and the Justice Department surrounding the Clintons' family philanthropy heated up, according to people familiar with the matter.\par \par \uc2 The latest development began in early October when New York-based \uc2 FBI\uc2  officials notified Andrew McCabe, the bureau's second-in-command, that while investigating Mr. Weiner for possibly sending sexually charged messages to a teenage minor, they had recovered a laptop. Many of the 650,000 emails on the computer, they said, were from the accounts of Ms. Abedin, according to people familiar with the matter.\par \par \uc2 Those emails stretched back years, these people said, and were on a laptop that hadn't previously come up in the \uc2 Clinton\uc2  email probe. Ms. Abedin said in late August that the couple were separating.\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 FBI\uc2  had searched the computer while looking for child pornography, people familiar with the matter said, but the warrant they used didn't give them authority to search for matters related to Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's email arrangement at the State Department. Mr. Weiner has denied sending explicit or indecent messages to the minor.\par \par \uc2 In their initial review of the laptop, the metadata showed many messages, apparently in the thousands, that were either sent to or from the private email server at Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's home that had been the focus of so much investigative effort for the \uc2 FBI\uc2 . Senior FBI officials decided to let the Weiner investigators proceed with a closer examination of the metadata on the computer, and report back to them.\par \par \uc2 At a meeting early last week of senior Justice Department and \uc2 FBI\uc2  officials, a member of the department's senior national-security staff asked for an update on the Weiner laptop, the people familiar with the matter said. At that point, officials realized that no one had acted to obtain a warrant, these people said.\par \par \uc2 Mr. McCabe then instructed the email investigators to talk to the Weiner investigators and see whether the laptop's contents could be relevant to the \uc2 Clinton\uc2  email probe, these people said. After the investigators spoke, the agents agreed it was potentially relevant.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Comey was given an update, decided to go forward with the case and notified Congress on Friday, with explosive results. Senior Justice Department officials had warned the \uc2 FBI\uc2  that telling Congress would violate policies against overt actions that could affect an \uc2 election\uc2 , and some within the \uc2 FBI\uc2  have been unhappy at Mr. Comey's repeated public statements on the probe, going back to his press conference on the subject in July.\par \par \uc2 The back-and-forth reflects how the bureau is probing several matters related, directly or indirectly, to Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  and her inner circle.\par \par \uc2 New details show that senior law-enforcement officials repeatedly voiced skepticism of the strength of the evidence in a bureau investigation of the \uc2 Clinton\uc2  Foundation\uc2 , sought to condense what was at times a sprawling cross-country effort, and, according to some people familiar with the matter, told agents to limit their pursuit of the case. The probe of the foundation began more than a year ago to determine whether financial crimes or influence peddling occurred related to the charity.\par \par \uc2 Some investigators grew frustrated, viewing \uc2 FBI\uc2  leadership as uninterested in probing the charity, these people said. Others involved disagreed sharply, defending \uc2 FBI\uc2  bosses and saying Mr. McCabe in particular was caught between an increasingly acrimonious fight for control between the Justice Department and \uc2 FBI\uc2  agents pursuing the \uc2 Clinton\uc2  Foundation\uc2  case.\par \par \uc2 It isn't unusual for field agents to favor a more aggressive approach than supervisors and prosecutors think is merited. But the internal debates about the \uc2 Clinton\uc2  Foundation\uc2  show the high stakes when such disagreements occur surrounding someone who is running for president.\par \par \uc2 The Wall Street Journal reported last week that Mr. McCabe's wife, Jill McCabe, received $467,500 in campaign funds in late 2015 from the political-action committee of Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe, a longtime ally of the Clintons and, until he was elected governor in November 2013, a \uc2 Clinton\uc2  Foundation\uc2  board member.\par \par \uc2 Mr. McAuliffe had supported Dr. McCabe in the hopes she and a handful of other Democrats might help win a majority in the state Senate. Dr. McCabe lost her race last November, and Democrats failed to win their majority.\par \par \uc2 A spokesman for the governor has said that "any insinuation that his support was tied to anything other than his desire to elect candidates who would help pass his agenda is ridiculous."\par \par \uc2 Dr. McCabe told the Journal, "Once I decided to run, my husband had no formal role in my campaign other than to be" supportive.\par \par \uc2 In February of this year, Mr. McCabe ascended from the No. 3 position at the \uc2 FBI\uc2  to the deputy director post. When he assumed that role, officials say, he started overseeing the probe into Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's use of a private email server for government work when she was secretary of state.\par \par \uc2 FBI\uc2  officials have said Mr. McCabe had no role in the \uc2 Clinton\uc2  email probe until he became deputy director, and by then his wife's campaign was over.\par \par \uc2 But other \uc2 Clinton\uc2 -related investigations were under way within the \uc2 FBI\uc2 , and they have been the subject of internal debate for months, according to people familiar with the matter.\par \par \uc2 Early this year, four \uc2 FBI\uc2  field offices -- New York, Los Angeles, Washington and Little Rock, Ark. -- were collecting information about the \uc2 Clinton\uc2  Foundation\uc2  to see if there was evidence of financial crimes or influence-peddling, according to people familiar with the matter.\par \par \uc2 Los Angeles agents had picked up information about the \uc2 Clinton\uc2  Foundation\uc2  from an unrelated public-corruption case and had issued some subpoenas for bank records related to the foundation, these people said.\par \par \uc2 The Washington field office was probing financial relationships involving Mr. McAuliffe before he became a \uc2 Clinton\uc2  Foundation\uc2  board member, these people said. Mr. McAuliffe has denied any wrongdoing, and his lawyer has said the probe is focused on whether he failed to register as an agent of a foreign entity.\par \par \uc2 Clinton\uc2  Foundation\uc2  officials have long denied any wrongdoing, saying it is a well-run charity that has done immense good.\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 FBI\uc2  field office in New York had done the most work on the \uc2 Clinton\uc2  Foundation\uc2  case and received help from the \uc2 FBI\uc2  field office in Little Rock, the people familiar with the matter said.\par \par \uc2 In February, \uc2 FBI\uc2  officials made a presentation to the Justice Department, according to these people. By all accounts, the meeting didn't go well.\par \par \uc2 Some said that is because the \uc2 FBI\uc2  didn't present compelling evidence to justify more aggressive pursuit of the \uc2 Clinton\uc2  Foundation\uc2 , and that the career anticorruption prosecutors in the room simply believed it wasn't a very strong case. Others said that from the start, the Justice Department officials were stern, icy and dismissive of the case.\par \par \uc2 "That was one of the weirdest meetings I've ever been to," one participant told others afterward, according to people familiar with the matter.\par \par \uc2 Anticorruption prosecutors at the Justice Department told the \uc2 FBI\uc2  at the meeting they wouldn't authorize more aggressive investigative techniques, such as subpoenas, formal witness interviews, or grand-jury activity. But the \uc2 FBI\uc2  officials believed they were well within their authority to pursue the leads and methods already under way, these people said.\par \par \uc2 About a week after Mr. Comey's July announcement that he was recommending against any prosecution in the \uc2 Clinton\uc2  email case, the \uc2 FBI\uc2  sought to refocus the \uc2 Clinton\uc2  Foundation\uc2  probe, with Mr. McCabe deciding the \uc2 FBI\uc2 's New York office would take the lead, with assistance from Little Rock.\par \par \uc2 The Washington field office, \uc2 FBI\uc2  officials decided, would focus on a separate matter involving Mr. McAuliffe. Mr. McCabe had decided earlier in the spring that he would continue to recuse himself from that probe, given the governor's contributions to his wife's former political campaign.\par \par \uc2 Within the \uc2 FBI\uc2 , the decision was viewed with skepticism by some, who felt the probe would be stronger if the foundation and McAuliffe matters were combined. Others, particularly Justice Department anticorruption prosecutors, felt that both probes were weak, based largely on publicly available information, and had found little that would merit expanded investigative authority.\par \par \uc2 According to a person familiar with the probes, on Aug. 12, a senior Justice Department official called Mr. McCabe to voice his displeasure at finding that New York FBI agents were still openly pursuing the \uc2 Clinton\uc2  Foundation\uc2  probe during the \uc2 election\uc2  season. Mr. McCabe said agents still had the authority to pursue the issue as long as they didn't use overt methods requiring Justice Department approvals.\par \par \uc2 The Justice Department official was "very pissed off," according to one person close to Mr. McCabe, and pressed him to explain why the \uc2 FBI\uc2  was still chasing a matter the department considered dormant. Others said the Justice Department was simply trying to make sure \uc2 FBI\uc2  agents were following longstanding policy not to make overt investigative moves that could be seen as trying to influence an \uc2 election\uc2 . Those rules discourage investigators from making any such moves before a primary or general \uc2 election\uc2 , and, at a minimum, checking with anticorruption prosecutors before doing so.\par \par \uc2 "Are you telling me that I need to shut down a validly predicated investigation?" Mr. McCabe asked, according to people familiar with the conversation. After a pause, the official replied, "Of course not," these people said.\par \par \uc2 For Mr. McCabe's defenders, the exchange showed how he was stuck between an \uc2 FBI\uc2  office eager to pour more resources into a case and Justice Department prosecutors who didn't think much of the case, one person said. Those people said that following the call, Mr. McCabe reiterated past instructions to \uc2 FBI\uc2  agents that they were to keep pursuing the work within the authority they had.\par \par \uc2 Others further down the \uc2 FBI\uc2  chain of command, however, said agents were given a much starker instruction on the case: "Stand down." When agents questioned why they weren't allowed to take more aggressive steps, they said they were told the order had come from the deputy director -- Mr. McCabe.\par \par \uc2 Others familiar with the matter deny Mr. McCabe or any other senior \uc2 FBI\uc2  official gave such a stand-down instruction.\par \par \uc2 For agents who already felt uneasy about \uc2 FBI\uc2  leadership's handling of the \uc2 Clinton\uc2  Foundation\uc2  case, the moment only deepened their concerns, these people said. For those who felt the probe hadn't yet found significant evidence of criminal conduct, the leadership's approach was the right response.\par \par \uc2 In September, agents on the foundation case asked to see the emails contained on nongovernment laptops that had been searched as part of the \uc2 Clinton\uc2  email case, but that request was rejected by prosecutors at the Eastern District of New York, in Brooklyn. Those emails were given to the \uc2 FBI\uc2  based on grants of partial immunity and limited-use agreements, meaning agents could only use them for the purpose of investigating possible mishandling of classified information.\par \par \uc2 Some \uc2 FBI\uc2  agents were dissatisfied with that answer, and asked for permission to make a similar request to federal prosecutors in Manhattan, according to people familiar with the matter. Mr. McCabe, these people said, told them no and added that they couldn't "go prosecutor-shopping."\par \par \uc2 Not long after that discussion, \uc2 FBI\uc2  agents informed the bureau's leaders about the Weiner laptop, prompting Mr. Comey's disclosure to Congress and setting off the furor that promises to consume the final days of a tumultuous campaign.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=wjco20161031000099"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document J000000020161031ecav0002i\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw272\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4080\pichgoal600

\par\par \b \uc2 Election\uc2  2016: Probe Leaves Abedin's Role in Question\b0\par\par\uc2 By Laura Meckler   \par \uc2 694 \uc2 words\par \uc2 31 October 2016\par \uc2 The Wall Street Journal\par \uc2 J\par A8\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 Huma Abedin has been by \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's side for 20 years, since she was a White House intern assigned to the first lady's office. There has never been much question that if Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  returned to the White House as president, Ms. Abedin would come, too.\par \par \uc2 Now with Ms. Abedin again part of unwelcome attention, even some Democrats are wondering if Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  might be forced to rethink Ms. Abedin's role if she is elected president, and whether a cloud would linger over her if Ms. Abedin were to take a senior White House job.\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 Federal Bureau of Investigation\uc2  on Friday said it had found additional emails potentially related to the probe, completed this summer, of Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's private server when she was secretary of state. The new emails come from a laptop that investigators believe was used by Ms. Abedin and her estranged husband, former Rep. Anthony Weiner, and were found during an investigation of Mr. Weiner for allegedly exchanging sexually explicit text messages and photos with a 15-year-old girl.\par \par \uc2 Ms. Abedin now finds herself as a central character in a late-breaking drama that has added an unpredictable factor into what many people in both parties saw as an \uc2 election\uc2  heading toward a \uc2 Clinton\uc2  victory.\par \par \uc2 Some Democrats on Sunday said they had no doubt Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  would bring Ms. Abedin with her to the White House. Others said her future may depend on what the renewed investigation finds. It is possible the emails are purely personal, were already turned over to investigators, or are duplicates of messages already examined, meaning the long-term damage to Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  -- and Ms. Abedin -- may be minimal.\par \par \uc2 More serious findings could have more significant ramifications. And the process of reading the messages, which may number in the thousands, will take weeks and won't be completed until well after \uc2 Election\uc2  Day.\par \par \uc2 Democrats point to Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's loyalty to her friends and staff, many of whom have been with her for years. Ms. Abedin, who is said to be personally closer to the candidate than any other adviser, is often described as akin to a second daughter.\par \par \uc2 On the campaign, Ms. Abedin has been involved in anything involving Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  personally, including speeches, statements, meetings and debate preparation.\par \par \uc2 "She's played a central and vital role in this campaign," \uc2 Clinton\uc2  campaign chairman \uc2 John Podesta\uc2  said Sunday on \uc2 CNN\uc2 's State of the Union.\par \par \uc2 Ms. Abedin wasn't on the road this weekend, but is expected to return to Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's side in coming days.\par \par \uc2 At rallies this weekend, Republican presidential nominee \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  repeatedly mentioned Ms. Abedin by name. "Is she going to keep Huma?" Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  asked on Saturday in Golden, Colo. "Huma's been a problem."\par \par \uc2 The timing of this disclosure, just days before the \uc2 election\uc2 , is particularly uncomfortable for Ms. Abedin, but it isn't the first time she has been under scrutiny.\par \par \uc2 Because she had a personal email address on the \uc2 Clinton\uc2  family server, conservative groups have been able to obtain, through lawsuits, all of Ms. Abedin's correspondence. They have also gotten many of her emails from her State Department account. Several of them show \uc2 Clinton\uc2  Foundation\uc2  officials asking her for favors.\par \par \uc2 Ms. Abedin also has been under investigation by \uc2 Sen. Charles Grassley\uc2  (R., Iowa) for an arrangement under the Special Government Employee program, which allowed her to simultaneously work for the State Department, Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  personally, the \uc2 Clinton\uc2  Foundation\uc2  and a private consulting firm called Teneo, which was founded in part by a former foundation official.\par \par \uc2 But the actions of Mr. Weiner, whom Ms. Abedin married in 2010, are the most personal and likely the most painful public controversy she has confronted. In 2011, the New York lawmaker resigned from Congress after admitting he had sent salacious photos and messages over the internet to other women. During his campaign for mayor of New York, it was disclosed that he had continued exchanging sexually explicit messages with other women after he left Congress.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=wjco20161031000104"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document J000000020161031ecav0002m\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw272\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4080\pichgoal600

\par\par \b \uc2 Democrats Fire At FBI Director Over Email Move\b0\par\par\uc2 By Peter Nicholas, Rebecca Ballhaus and Byron Tau   \par \uc2 1,004 \uc2 words\par \uc2 31 October 2016\par \uc2 The Wall Street Journal\par \uc2 J\par A1\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 WILTON MANORS, Fla. -- \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's team worked Sunday to play down the news that an investigation of her email practices had been reactivated and sought to undermine the credibility of James Comey, the Federal Bureau of Investigation director who disclosed the move last week.\par \par \uc2 Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid of Nevada sent a letter Sunday to Mr. Comey, accusing him of interfering in the presidential race in ways that could damage Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , the Democratic nominee. Mr. Comey announced the discovery of additional emails Friday in a letter to Congress.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Reid said Mr. Comey's action may have violated the federal Hatch Act, which bars government officials from using their position to influence an \uc2 election\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Mr. Reid also complained of a "disturbing double standard," suggesting that the \uc2 FBI\uc2  has kept information about alleged associations between \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2 's campaign and Russia confidential while publicizing "in the most negative light possible" the "slightest innuendo related to Secretary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 ."\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 FBI\uc2  declined to comment.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , the Republican presidential nominee, and his backers aimed to capitalize on the moment just nine days before the elections. "It was just learned, by the way, that they just found 650,000 emails," Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  said at a campaign stop Sunday in Greeley, Colo.\par \par \uc2 "This could be the mother lode. This could be the 33,000 that are missing," he said, referring to the messages that Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's attorneys deleted after deeming them entirely personal.\par \par \uc2 Wayne Allyn Root, a Republican activist and television personality, told a rally of \uc2 Trump\uc2  supporters in Las Vegas that "the \uc2 FBI\uc2  has given us Christmas in October."\par \par \uc2 Speaking Sunday in Florida, Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  said that "there's a lot of noise and distraction, but it really comes down to what kind of future we want, and what kind of president can help us get there. We won't be distracted no matter what our opponents throw at us."\par \par \uc2 An ABC News/Washington Post tracking poll released Sunday showed Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  leading by just one point nationally -- 46% to 45% -- down from 12 points a week ago. The lead is within the survey's margin of error.\par \par \uc2 Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's campaign, once confident of her path to victory in the presidential race, had hoped to put forward an affirmative message in the final days that she could use to rally the country in the event she wins the White House.\par \par \uc2 Now aides are working to defuse what damage may have been done by Mr. Comey's letter to congressional leaders, which said the \uc2 FBI\uc2  wanted to review newly discovered emails related to a long-running investigation into Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's email practices as secretary of state.\par \par \uc2 Attacking Mr. Comey may prove risky because he isn't a clear-cut partisan. While he served in the Justice Department under George W. Bush, he was nominated to be FBI director in 2013 by Democratic President \uc2 Barack Obama\uc2 , whom Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  has embraced in the course of the campaign.\par \par \uc2 Jon Favreau, a former speechwriter under Mr. Obama, tweeted on Sunday, in reference to Mr. Reid's letter, that "accusing Comey of a Hatch Act violation is not necessarily a strategy I'd pursue."\par \par \uc2 Privately, some of Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's top supporters expressed concern about what the turn of events might portend. They had believed the \uc2 FBI\uc2  had put to rest the long-running \uc2 Clinton\uc2  email saga when Mr. Comey announced in July there was no cause for criminal charges.\par \par \uc2 The emails at issue were found in a separate \uc2 FBI\uc2  probe of former Democratic U.S. Rep. Anthony Weiner, who is under investigation for allegedly sending sexually explicit messages to a minor, according to a person familiar with the case.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Weiner is married to Huma Abedin, a longtime \uc2 Clinton\uc2  aide who recently announced she and her husband were separating.\par \par \uc2 One person close to the \uc2 Clinton\uc2  campaign said that even one hour the campaign spends talking about emails "is not a good hour."\par \par \uc2 Another top supporter worried that the renewed focus on Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's email practices would make voters wary that if she wins, her presidency would be marred by never-ending investigations into her dealings.\par \par \uc2 Asked about the impact of the \uc2 FBI\uc2  announcement, Democratic strategist David Axelrod said: "The answer is no one who isn't lying knows for sure."\par \par \uc2 He added: "My guess is that much of this was priced into her stock already, it is late and most have either voted or made up their minds, so this won't be the game-changer \uc2 Trump\uc2  hopes."\par \par \uc2 Former Pennsylvania Gov. Ed Rendell, a Democrat and longtime \uc2 Clinton\uc2  supporter, said thatmarginally supportive \uc2 Trump\uc2  voters who might not have been voting at all will now be motivated to cast ballots.\par \par \uc2 "This absolutely will get them to the polls," he said. "The base was dispirited. Now they are revved up and ready to go. It will help \uc2 Trump\uc2  get his voters out."\par \par \uc2 Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's campaign allies believe she still has structural advantages that Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  can't match and that will spell the difference in the end. They point to a strong field organization in battleground states built over a period of months.\par \par \uc2 Hilary Rosen, a Democratic strategist who is close to the \uc2 Clinton\uc2  campaign, said Sunday that it needs "to keep the turnout operation strong and vigorous, and from what I hear it's going really well. People on the ground are not discouraged but aggravated."\par \par \uc2 Attentive to the need to keep her voters motivated, Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  also spent time Sunday at an African-American church in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., the New Mount Olive Baptist Church, where she spoke about overcoming obstacles.\par \par \uc2 "Everyone -- everyone -- is knocked down in life," she told about 300 churchgoers. "And as my mother showed me and taught me, what matters is whether you get back up."\par \par \uc2 ---\par \par \uc2 Michael C.

\par\par \b \uc2 Election\uc2  2016: Hispanic Voter Surge Recasts Texas\b0\par\par\uc2 By Dan Frosch   \par \uc2 555 \uc2 words\par \uc2 31 October 2016\par \uc2 The Wall Street Journal\par \uc2 J\par A4\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 DALLAS -- Recent polls show a surprisingly tight race in Texas between \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  and \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , and a surge in registered voters is adding to one of the \uc2 election\uc2 's great unknowns: Could the presidential race end up being unusually close in the reliably red Lone Star State?\par \par \uc2 A Democratic presidential candidate hasn't won Texas since \uc2 Jimmy Carter\uc2  in 1976. \uc2 John McCain\uc2  beat \uc2 Barack Obama\uc2  by 12 points in 2008, and \uc2 Mitt Romney\uc2  won by 16 points four years later.\par \par \uc2 A record-breaking 15.1 million people are now registered to vote in Texas, an increase of more than 1.45 million since the 2012 \uc2 election\uc2 , according to Secretary of State Carlos Cascos.\par \par \uc2 Texas doesn't register voters by party, so it is unclear which party benefits the most. Mr. Cascos said that aside from population growth, the leading factor in the tide of newly registered voters appears to be increased interest in the presidential \uc2 election\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 "The only thing we can glean from this data is that the newly registered voters are disproportionately Hispanic,"said Mark Jones, a political-science professor at Rice University. But he said "there's also an increase in non-Hispanic voters."\par \par \uc2 Some of the new voters could be people who registered "specifically to oppose \uc2 Trump\uc2  or people brought into the political process by \uc2 Trump\uc2  and who will support him," Mr. Jones said.\par \par \uc2 Recent polls show Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's lead here has narrowed, prompting Real ClearPolitics, which averages polling, to move Texas into the toss up column. Political experts still expect the Republican nominee take the state but say discontent with him among Texas conservatives, combined with a continuing push from Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's Democratic backers to tap Hispanic voters, could make the margin slimmer than usual for the GOP.\par \par \uc2 In \uc2 Harris County\uc2 , which includes Houston, the number of registered voters with Spanish surnames increased 22% between July 2012 and July 2016, numbers compiled by the county clerk show. Those with non-Spanish surnames grew only 10% over the same period. Similar figures were reported in Dallas County.\par \par \uc2 A Wall Street Journal analysis found Texas counties with significant voter increases don't appear to be fertile ground for Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , because of their large populations of Hispanics and college-educated voters, two challenging demographic groups for him.\par \par \uc2 "In the past, we had to explain to people why it was important to vote. It was always a struggle," said Carlos Duarte, state director for Mi Familia Vota, a group that focuses on registering Hispanic voters and is operating extensively in Houston, Dallas and San Antonio. "But this year, not at all."\par \par \uc2 Still, Hispanics have historically voted at lower rates in Texas compared with nationally. Just 39% of eligible Hispanic voters there cast ballots in the 2012 presidential \uc2 election\uc2 , compared with about 48% in the rest of the country, census data showed.\par \par \uc2 Early voting in the state started last week, and record numbers of Texans have turned out. \uc2 Harris County\uc2  saw a 44% increase over the first five days of early voting versus 2012, according to the secretary of state's office. In Dallas County, there was a 56% increase over the first five days of early voting.\par \par \uc2 ---\par \par \uc2 Dante Chinni contributed to this article.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=wjco20161031000086"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document J000000020161031ecav00025\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw272\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4080\pichgoal600

\par\par \b \uc2 Election\uc2  2016: States Test Security of Voting Systems --- Amid fear of foreign hackers and claims of fraud, officials search for vulnerabilities\b0\par\par\uc2 By Damian Paletta   \par \uc2 989 \uc2 words\par \uc2 31 October 2016\par \uc2 The Wall Street Journal\par \uc2 J\par A4\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 PARKER, Ariz. -- The test began at 8 a.m. last Tuesday. Secretary of State Michele Reagan, four staffers and a Spanish-language interpreter cast 138 votes on 40 ballots using seven touch-screen machines. The mood was jovial -- until a printout showed the numbers on one machine didn't line up with the master list of votes.\par \par \uc2 Janine Petty, Arizona's deputy state \uc2 election\uc2  director, scanned the printout and quickly discovered another of Ms. Reagan's staffers had voted for two of the wrong candidates. The machine had worked perfectly, after all.\par \par \uc2 Ms. Reagan jokingly admonished the sheepish staffer, telling him he should go on their fictional "Wall of Shame."\par \par \uc2 Across the country, state \uc2 election\uc2  officials are carrying out final tests on tens of thousands of voting machines that are part of a multistep process that delivers results in local, state and federal contests. Next week, the last of more than 120 million ballots are expected to be cast in a watershed \uc2 election\uc2  to determine who controls the White House, Congress and the direction of the Supreme Court.\par \par \uc2 In a span of hours, the votes will be counted in places ranging from the Moose Lodge in Key West, Fla., to a fire hall in Kodiak, Alaska. The process was designed so the federal government didn't oversee it, but new fears about hackers from abroad have led to a scramble to see if the security protocols in place are sufficient.\par \par \uc2 In Arizona, officials have been on edge for months. In July, a Russia-linked hacker posted online the stolen login credentials of a Gila County \uc2 election\uc2  official, spooking Ms. Reagan and others around the country. They know now that protecting the voting process means guarding against much different threats than they have confrontedin the past.\par \par \uc2 "We're not dealing with a couple of kids sitting in their bedroom," she said. "It's cyberwarfare. These little state agencies are not the Pentagon. We don't have the resources."\par \par \uc2 Beyond cyber issues, there are other concerns. Republican presidential nominee \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  has promoted unsubstantiated rumors of vote rigging and fraud, saying illegal immigrants have entered the U.S. from Mexico and will cast millions of votes.\par \par \uc2 Arizona has dealt with voting challenges for decades. At one time, it loaded ballots onto mules for a 10-mile trek from a polling site at the base of the Grand Canyon to its rim. But in July, the state had to take the entire voter registration system offline to ensure that the hacker who had stolen the Gila County login credentials hadn't tampered with the information of 3.4 million voters.\par \par \uc2 Russian officials have denied trying to interfere in the November elections, but the threat has awakened new fears.\par \par \uc2 "No one, not even the federal government, can protect themselves against the most sophisticated threat," said \uc2 Joseph Lorenzo Hall\uc2 , an \uc2 election\uc2  security expert and chief technologist at the \uc2 Center for Democracy and Technology\uc2 . "What you see is people realizing that we have not been attuned to certain threats. Everyone is adopting armor."\par \par \uc2 Even though Ms. Reagan and other state officials believe their voting machines cannot be hacked, they worry that antagonists could confuse the public by publishing false results on social media or temporarily knocking a state \uc2 election\uc2  site offline.\par \par \uc2 Arizona is considered a reliably Republican state, but this year is different and that is raising the stakes for \uc2 election\uc2  officials. Polls suggest the presidential race here is tied. GOP Sen. John McCain has had to work to fight off a challenge from Democratic Rep. Ann Kirkpatrick. Longtime Maricopa County Sheriff Joseph Arpaio, a Republican, risks being ousted.\par \par \uc2 Here in La Paz County, voter enrollment has jumped to 9,000 this year from around 8,000 in 2014. \uc2 Election\uc2  director Kevin Scholl watches the state \uc2 election\uc2  testers with a forced smile, hoping they don't uncover any problems with his machines, which are more than 10 years old and will be replaced soon.\par \par \uc2 When they aren't in use, the machines are sealed and locked down the hall, in a room that abuts a computer closet, which is also disconnected from the internet. Once voting is complete, memory cards are pulled out of the machines and loaded into that computer system in the secure room. The votes are tallied and then loaded onto a memory card, which is put into a different computer that sends the results securely to Ms. Reagan's team in Phoenix. Each of Arizona's 15 counties follows the same process.\par \par \uc2 Ms. Reagan and her team wrapped up in Parker before 11 a.m., and then re-boarded their plane and flew to Yuma, a larger town near the Mexico border. She brought with her Ken Matta, a systems administrator who has been conducting tests since 2002.\par \par \uc2 In Yuma, they were met by Robyn Stallworth Pouquette, the county recorder. Her office has received calls for weeks from people voicing concerns that the \uc2 election\uc2  will be "rigged."\par \par \uc2 The board of supervisors' office in Yuma County is in an old bank, and the ballots are locked in a giant vault. Within minutes, Ms. Reagan and her team cast 2,906 votes on the machines there, looking for discrepancies.\par \par \uc2 Standing with Ms. Pouquette was Paul Melcher, deputy county administrator, who is serving as interim head of elections. They ran through numerous contingency plans for Nov. 8. What do they do if there is a natural disaster? A terrorist attack? The power goes out?\par \par \uc2 "You try to plan for the unexpected," he said.\par \par \uc2 At 12:02 p.m., Ms. Petty collected paperwork and the votes in Yuma lined up perfectly.\par \par \uc2 "Everything was beautiful," she told Ms. Pouquette and Mr. Melcher.\par \par \uc2 (See related article: "Hackers Test Systems for 'Doors'" -- WSJ October 31, 2016)\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=wjco20161031000085"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document J000000020161031ecav00024\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw272\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4080\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  is in a dead heat with \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  in Florida and holds a 6-point lead in North Carolina, according to new polls that give a sense of the cushion Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  could use to absorb any fallout from a \uc2 Federal Bureau of Investigation\uc2  review of \uc2 Clinton\uc2 -related emails.\par \par \uc2 The Wall Street Journal/NBC News/Marist surveys, conducted Tuesday and Wednesday, found Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  leading by a percentage point in Florida, 45% to Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's 44%. That margin was narrower than the 3-point lead she held a month ago.\par \par \uc2 In North Carolina, the Democratic presidential candidate's lead of 47% to 41% had grown from a 4-point advantage earlier this month.\par \par \uc2 The new surveys suggest Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  has more political maneuvering room in North Carolina than in Florida. If Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  lost either state, he could have few options for gathering the required 270 Electoral College votes.\par \par \uc2 The polls show that neither candidate has room for missteps in Florida, the nation's largest battleground state with 29 electoral votes.\par \par \uc2 Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's support has remained static in Florida while Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's has inched up since the previous poll in early October. Both candidates have strong support from their own party bases, but independent voters have swung to Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , favoring him now by a margin of 41% to 36%.\par \par \uc2 In the previous Journal/NBC/Marist poll, Florida independents had favored Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , 42% to 33%.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=wjco20161031000079"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document J000000020161031ecav0001y\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw272\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4080\pichgoal600

\par\par \b \uc2 Election\uc2  2016: Undecided Voters Lean Toward the GOP --- But polling shows this group shows less interest in the \uc2 election\uc2  than voters overall\b0\par\par\uc2 By Aaron Zitner   \par \uc2 589 \uc2 words\par \uc2 31 October 2016\par \uc2 The Wall Street Journal\par \uc2 J\par A6\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 The sliver of voters who haven't yet settled on a presidential candidate are more Republican-leaning as a group than Democratic, suggesting GOP nominee \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  could make last-minute gains if he can persuade those voters to return to their home party.\par \par \uc2 Some 30% of undecided voters call themselves Republicans, compared with 21% who identify as Democrats, an analysis of Wall Street Journal/NBC News national polling shows.\par \par \uc2 In another sign of the Republican tilt of undecided voters, some 42% of those voters say they want the next Congress to be controlled by the GOP, suggesting they are Republicans at heart. Some 35% say they prefer Democratic control.\par \par \uc2 Those numbers also mark a reversal from 2012, when Democrats in the pool of undecided voters outnumbered Republicans by 12 percentage points and a plurality wanted to see a Democratic-led Congress.\par \par \uc2 "Unlike 2012, when undecided voters were breaking for President Obama, the 'juice' in the undecided vote this year is favoring Republicans," said Micah Roberts, a Republican pollster who works on Journal/NBC News surveys.\par \par \uc2 The analysis looked at Journal/NBC polls conducted in early- and mid-October, before the \uc2 Federal Bureau of Investigation\uc2  announced Friday that it wasreviewing new evidence in connection with its investigation of \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's use of a private email server.\par \par \uc2 Some 8% of registered voters remain undecided in the presidential race, according to the analysis. With Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  trailing in most national polls, those voters could help him narrow the gap with Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Should the profile of undecided voters in individual states mirror the national picture, Mr. Roberts said, "there's a chance. . .that some of the battleground states could end up being closer than the polling today suggests, if these voters actually go out and vote."\par \par \uc2 That is a significant caveat: Only 42% of undecided voters rate themselves as highly interested in the \uc2 election\uc2 , suggesting it will take a push from the \uc2 Trump\uc2  team or another force to push them to vote. By comparison, about 72% of voters overall rate themselves as highly interested in the \uc2 election\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 The undecided pool includes voters such as Phyllis and Larry De Camp of Perry Township, Ohio, about an hour's drive south of Cleveland. "I don't remember any year that I was so undecided on who I would vote for," said Mr. De Camp, a retired grocery chain manager who is 79 years old.\par \par \uc2 Mr. and Mrs. De Camp were so indecisive that when their absentee ballots arrived, they laid them on atable alongside a bottle of Jameson whiskey and a gallon jug of wine. Then, they posed for a photo with the tableau -- to show, in jest, that their presidential decision was driving them to drink. They posted it online with the caption: "Now, what do we do?"\par \par \uc2 Mrs. De Camp, 69, who had backed President \uc2 Barack Obama\uc2  in the last \uc2 election\uc2 , finally made a decision after consulting her grown sons: She marked her ballot for Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Mr. De Camp, who backed the GOP nominee in 2012, hadn't yet filled out his ballot as of late last week.\par \par \uc2 The analysis of Journal/NBC News polls looked at interviews with 1,900 registered voters from surveys conducted in early- and mid-October. It compared them with surveys of 1,800 voters conducted just before the 2012 \uc2 election\uc2 .\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=wjco20161031000078"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document J000000020161031ecav0001x\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw272\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4080\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 Abreast of the Market\par \b \uc2 Investors Gird for Turmoil --- Market participants scale back their bets against volatility as anxiety rears its head\b0\par\par\uc2 By Asjylyn Loder   \par \uc2 1,005 \uc2 words\par \uc2 31 October 2016\par \uc2 The Wall Street Journal\par \uc2 J\par C1\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 Wall Street's bet against fear, a big winner this year, is starting to wane.\par \par \uc2 The relative calm in the U.S. stock market has made wagering on a decline in the \uc2 CBOE\uc2  Volatility Index, or VIX, a popular trade for much of this year. The two biggest exchange-traded funds that short volatility, as betting on a decline in the VIX is known among traders, are up 46% this year. Hedge-fund bets that the VIX will decline reached a record in September, according to data from the \uc2 Commodity Futures Trading Commission\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 "These strategies have had a pretty significant up year," said Rocky Fishman, equity-derivatives strategist for \uc2 Deutsche Bank\uc2 . "Those positions make money most of the time, but they lose money very quickly when volatility rises."\par \par \uc2 Lately, investors seem increasingly worried about that outcome.\par \par \uc2 The VIX, a measure of traders' expectations for market swings, climbed 5.4% Friday after the \uc2 Federal Bureau of Investigation\uc2  announced that it was reviewing new evidence in the investigation of Democratic presidential candidate \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's email server, a probe that the \uc2 FBI\uc2  had closed this summer. The news sparked worries about a surprise \uc2 election\uc2  outcome after polls had shifted toward Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  in recent weeks and traders positioned themselves for a muted response to the outcome of the Nov. 8 vote.\par \par \uc2 Even before then, hedge funds had been paring their short bets. Since early September, short bets on volatility futures are down 21%, CFTC data show. And flows of money into and out of exchange-traded funds indicate expectations for greater volatility. In the month ended Oct. 25, $822 million flowed into ETFs that profit when volatility rises, while $326 million was pulled out of the shorts, according to FactSet.\par \par \uc2 The adjustment could reflect concerns about two coming, potentially market-moving events -- the U.S. presidential \uc2 election\uc2  and a possible interest-rate increase. The \uc2 Federal Reserve\uc2  isn't expected to raise rates at its November meeting this week but may send a signal about its plans for December.\par \par \uc2 The interest in trading volatility also shows the rise of the VIX as an asset class. Since the VIX tends to soar when stocks tumble, betting on volatility to rise -- called going long -- has emerged as a popular way to protect portfolios.\par \par \uc2 The advent of volatility ETFs in 2009 increased the appeal. The funds can be bought and sold like any stock, allowing investors to bet on the VIX without trading futures and options directly.\par \par \uc2 Using volatility as portfolio protection comes at a cost. Because uncertainty increases with time, the further away an anticipated downturn is, the more expensive it is to insure against. That means VIX futures for this month are typically cheaper than next month's contracts, which are cheaper than the month after that, and so on.\par \par \uc2 That forces most buyers to pay a premium to maintain their insurance. It is especially draining for the long exchange-traded funds that seek to profit from rising volatility. Some of the funds maintain their exposure through a combination of this month's VIX futures and next month's. Every day, they sell contracts that are nearing expiration and buy contracts for the following month. Put simply, the ETFs that are long volatility sell low and buy high, almost every day. The largest such ETF, the \uc2 iPath S&P 500 VIX Short-Term Futures ETN\uc2 , has declined 58% this year.\par \par \uc2 This creates an opportunity for the hedge funds and short ETFs that sell the insurance and take the opposite side of the trade. They will profit when the VIX declines. But even if volatility is relatively flat -- and sometimes even if it rises -- sellers still take their cut, buying low and selling high. That premium is why the trade has been so reliably profitable.\par \par \uc2 Shorting volatility has drawn interest in recent years because unconventional central-bank policies have calmed markets, enticing investors to try to boost returns through the trade.\par \par \uc2 But shorting the VIX can amplify losses in a stock-market downturn. For every percentage-point gain in volatility futures, hedge funds stand to lose $163 million on short bets, CFTC data show. The day after the U.K.'s surprise vote to exit from the \uc2 European Union\uc2 , the S&P 500 fell 3.6% and the VIX spiked 8.5 points. The two biggest short-volatility ETFs lost one-quarter of their value, although the losses later reversed.\par \par \uc2 "I worry every day about my positions and I worry about my hedges, but I believe in a systematic approach so you don't have to make decisions in the middle of a market panic," said David Pedack, a portfolio manager at \uc2 Russell Investments\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 The severity of the post-Brexit losses came as a shock to Bryan Sullivan, chief executive officer and managing partner of WealthSource Partners LLC. WealthSource, an investment-advisory firm in San Luis Obispo, Calif., that manages more than $600 million, bought 76,000 shares of the ProShares Short VIX Short-Term Futures ETF shortly before the vote. It was a new strategy for WealthSource, which saw its investment plummet 26% in hours, Mr. Sullivan said.\par \par \uc2 "Brexit was a good example where we got hammered for a few weeks," Mr. Sullivan said. "It was a big question: Are we sure we want to be doing this? We had some deep conversations about it, but we decided let's wait this out."\par \par \uc2 The ProShares ETF recovered its post-Brexit losses within a month and is now 25% higher than it was the day of the vote. Mr. Sullivan said, though, that he has since bailed out because of worries about rising volatility amid \uc2 election\uc2 -year uncertainty.\par \par \uc2 "A lot of things could drive volatility higher through the end of the year," Mr. Sullivan said. "So being short is not necessarily the right place to be."\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=wjco20161031000053"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document J000000020161031ecav00018\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw272\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4080\pichgoal600

\par\par \b \uc2 The FBI Director's Unworthy Choice\b0\par\par\uc2 By Michael B. Mukasey   \par \uc2 1,179 \uc2 words\par \uc2 31 October 2016\par \uc2 The Wall Street Journal\par \uc2 J\par A15\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 We need not worry unduly about the factual void at the center of the FBI director's announcement on Friday that the bureau had found emails -- perhaps thousands -- "pertinent" in some unspecified way to its investigation into \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's handling of classified emails while she was secretary of state.\par \par \uc2 True, we don't know what is actually in the emails of Huma Abedin, Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's close aide, but we can nonetheless draw some conclusions about how FBI Director James Comey came to issue his Delphic notice to Congress, and what the near-term future course of this investigation will be. Regrettably, those conclusions do no credit to him, or to the leadership of the Justice Department, of which the \uc2 FBI\uc2  is a part.\par \par \uc2 Friday's announcement had a history. Recall that Mr. Comey's authority extends only to supervising the gathering of facts to be presented to Justice Department lawyers for their confidential determination of whether those facts justify a federal prosecution.\par \par \uc2 Nonetheless, in July he announced that "no reasonable prosecutor" would seek to charge her with a crime, although Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  had classified information on a private nonsecure server -- at least a misdemeanor under one statute; and although she was "extremely careless" in her handling of classified information such that it was exposed to hacking by hostile foreign nations -- a felony under another statute; and apparently had caused the destruction of emails -- a felony under two other statutes. He then told Congress repeatedly that the investigation into her handling of emails was closed.\par \par \uc2 Those decisions were not his to make, nor were the reasons he offered for making them at all tenable: that prosecutions for anything but mishandling large amounts of classified information, accompanied by false statements to investigators, were unprecedented; and that criminal prosecutions for gross negligence were constitutionally suspect.\par \par \uc2 Members of the military have been imprisoned and dishonorably discharged for mishandling far less information, and prosecutions for criminal negligence are commonplace and entirely permissible. Yet the attorney general, whose decisions they were, and who had available to her enough legal voltage to vaporize Mr. Comey's flimsy reasons for inaction, told Congress she would simply defer to the director.\par \par \uc2 That July announcement of Mr. Comey, and that testimony by Attorney General Loretta Lynch, also had a history.\par \par \uc2 When the \uc2 FBI\uc2  learned that two of the secretary's staff members had classified information on their computers, rather than being handed grand-jury subpoenas demanding the surrender of those computers, the staff members received immunity in return for giving them up. In addition, they successfully insisted that the computers not be searched for any data following the date when Congress subpoenaed information relating to its own investigation, and that the computers be physically destroyed after relevant data within the stipulated period was extracted.\par \par \uc2 The technician who destroyed 30,000 of Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's emails after Congress directed that they be preserved lied to investigators even after receiving immunity. He then testified that \uc2 Clinton\uc2  aides requested before service of the subpoena that he destroy them, and that he destroyed them afterward on his own initiative.\par \par \uc2 Why would an FBI director, who at one time was an able and aggressive prosecutor, agree to such terms or accept such a fantastic story?\par \par \uc2 The search for clues brings us to an email to then-Secretary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  from President Obama, writing under a pseudonym, that the \uc2 FBI\uc2  showed to Ms. Abedin. That email, along with 21 others that passed between the president and Secretary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , has been withheld by the administration from release on confidentiality grounds not specified but that could only be executive privilege.\par \par \uc2 After disclosure of those emails, the president said during an interview that he thought Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  should not be criminally charged because there was no evidence that she had intended to harm the nation's security -- a showing required under none of the relevant statutes. As indefensible as his legal reasoning may have been, his practical reasoning is apparent: If Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  was at criminal risk for communicating on her nonsecure system, so was he.\par \par \uc2 That presented the FBI director with a dilemma that was difficult, but not complex. It offered two choices. He could have tried to proceed along the course marked by the relevant laws. The \uc2 FBI\uc2  is powerless to present evidence to a grand jury, or to issue grand-jury subpoenas. That authority lies with the Justice Department, headed by an attorney general who serves, as her certificate of appointment recites, "during the pleasure of the President of the United States for the time being."\par \par \uc2 However, the director could have urged the attorney general to allow the use of a grand jury. Grand juries sit continuously in all the districts where an investigation would have been conducted, and no grand jury need have been convened to deal with this case in particular. If she refused, he could have gone public with his request, and threatened to resign if it was not followed. If she had agreed, he would have been in the happy position last week of having discovered yet further evidence that could be offered in support of pending charges. If she had refused, he could have resigned.\par \par \uc2 There is precedent within the Justice Department for that course. During what came to be known as the Saturday night massacre in 1973, Attorney General Elliot Richardson and his deputy, \uc2 William Ruckelshaus\uc2 , resigned rather than follow President Nixon's order to fire Special Prosecutor \uc2 Archibald Cox\uc2 . Indeed, on his own telling, Mr. Comey threatened to resign as Deputy Attorney General unless the George W. Bush administration changed its electronic-surveillance program, although the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court later approved the feature to which he had objected.\par \par \uc2 Instead, Mr. Comey acceded to the apparent wish of President Obama that no charges be brought. There is precedent for that too -- older and less honorable. It goes back to the 12th century when Henry II asked, "who will rid me of this troublesome priest?" The king's eager subordinates duly proceeded to murder Archbishop Thomas Becket at the altar of Canterbury Cathedral. That choice -- to follow the sovereign's wish -- left Mr. Comey facing only further dishonor if he did not disclose the newly discovered emails and they leaked after the \uc2 election\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 And what of the future? Mr. Comey reportedly wrote his letter to Congress over the objection of the attorney general and her deputy. Thus, regardless of what is in the newly discovered emails, the current Justice Department will not permit a grand jury to hear evidence in this case. And because only a grand jury can constitutionally bring charges, that means no charges will be brought.\par \par \uc2 Which is to say, we know enough to conclude that what we don't know is of little immediate relevance to our current dismal situation.\par \par \uc2 ---\par \par \uc2 Mr. Mukasey served as U.S. attorney general (2007-09) and as a U.S. district judge for the Southern District of New York (1988-2006).\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=wjco20161031000039"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document J000000020161031ecav0000u\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 TABLE FOR THREE\par \uc2 Style Desk; SECTST\par \b \uc2 Yes, This Too Shall Pass\b0\par\par\uc2 By PHILIP GALANES \par \uc2 3,021 \uc2 words\par \uc2 30 October 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 1\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 CORRECTION APPENDEDHistory offers strange consolation: No matter how alarming current events (or a presidential \uc2 election\uc2 ) may be, historians can usually point to analogous episodes we survived in the past.\par \par \uc2 So who better to consult about our imminent \uc2 election\uc2  than the Pulitzer-winning presidential historian and biographer Doris Kearns Goodwin and the MSNBC host and political commentator Rachel Maddow?\par \par \uc2 Ms. Goodwin, 73, has written five critically acclaimed and best-selling presidential biographies, including ''Team of Rivals: The Political Genius of Abraham Lincoln,'' the basis, in part, for Steven Spielberg's film ''Lincoln''; ''No Ordinary Time: Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt: The Home Front in World War II''; and ''Lyndon Johnson and the American Dream,'' which grew out of Ms. Goodwin's tenure as a White House fellow at age 24. She worked directly with President Johnson in his last year in office and later assisted him with his memoirs. Ms. Goodwin received her Ph.D. in government from Harvard.\par \par \uc2 Ms. Maddow, 43, has hosted ''The Rachel Maddow Show'' weeknights on MSNBC since 2008. It is currently the network's highest-rated program. Like other shows on MSNBC, it leans liberal. But Ms. Maddow has been praised by many for the civility with which she treats all guests, prioritizing information and context over the hysteria so often evident on cable news.\par \par \uc2 She is the author of the best-selling book ''Drift: The Unmooring of American Military Power.'' Ms. Maddow earned a doctorate in politics from \uc2 Oxford University\uc2 , where she was a Rhodes scholar.\par \par \uc2 Over an early lunch of eggs and toast at the Gotham Lounge in the Peninsula Hotel in Midtown Manhattan, a few days before the final presidential debate this month, the pair discussed the coming \uc2 election\uc2  in historical terms: the temperamental forebears of \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  and \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2  among our presidential ranks, the ambitions of candidates and their skills for the job.\par \par \uc2 Philip Galanes: So, in terms of crazy, does this \uc2 election\uc2  have an historical peer?\par \par \uc2 Rachel Maddow: For sure. It's not like we've never had a figure like \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  in public life before.\par \par \uc2 PG: Really?\par \par \uc2 RM: There's some Huey Long there, and some P. T. Barnum. Some George Wallace.\par \par \uc2 Doris Kearns Goodwin: We've had plenty of populist figures in our past, but they had a different degree of substance than Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 . William Jennings Bryan [the Democratic nominee for president in 1896, 1900 and 1908] came out of a period like today. The industrial revolution was like our tech revolution and globalization. The pace of life had sped up and made people anxious. Telegrams and telephones were fast. Immigration was huge. And Bryan's supporters, like \uc2 Trump\uc2 's, were fearful about the way the country was changing.\par \par \uc2 RM: I'm more interested in whether there are parallels for political parties falling apart. As Doris wrote in ''The Bully Pulpit,'' our democracy unofficially depends on two major parties that can carry their own weight.\par \par \uc2 DKG: This is where history can give us solace. When parties split up, as the Whigs did in the 1850s, over slavery, we got the Republican Party and Abraham Lincoln, our greatest leader.\par \par \uc2 PG: I feel better already.\par \par \uc2 DKG: But then you have 1912, when Teddy Roosevelt decided to run against Taft. He knew that Taft had the Republican delegates, so he created the primary system: ''Let the people rule!'' It was democratic, no doubt about it. But the race was so vitriolic, it sounds like today. Taft calls Teddy a dictator; Teddy calls Taft a pinhead. And The \uc2 New York Times\uc2  says, ''If this is the first attempt at the primary system, we sincerely hope it's the last.''\par \par \uc2 PG: Has the temperament of a candidate ever been so center stage before?\par \par \uc2 RM: In 1964, for sure. The bead on [Barry] Goldwater was that he was a nut. L.B.J. successfully characterized him as someone who couldn't be trusted with the nuclear codes.\par \par \uc2 DKG: But it's come to the surface more today.\par \par \uc2 RM: Maybe because we get more access to the president as a human being than we used to. With the White House photographer posting all those moments on \uc2 Instagram\uc2 . And so much attention on his family.\par \par \uc2 DKG: Good point. Before, the candidates were leaders of one party or the other. The parties had platforms, and you were voting on what they promised you. You didn't really know them as human beings.\par \par \uc2 PG: And is temperament just code for hotheaded?\par \par \uc2 DKG: No, temperament is your basic orientation toward life. The Elizabethans boiled it down to four types: You were choleric or sanguine or melancholy or aggressive. You can be a good leader from any of them. Lincoln was melancholy, but what a president! It's more to do with how you grow, how you learn from your mistakes.\par \par \uc2 PG: How do you feel about Hillary's guarded temperament?\par \par \uc2 RM: I think it's a form of emotional maturity. It takes intellectual stamina to stay open, as a leader and a mind, to absorb information and adversity.\par \par \uc2 DKG: And criticism. That's what Eleanor Roosevelt decided. When people were against her, it meant they were against her ideas, not against her personally. True or not, it gave her enormous leeway not to take criticism personally.\par \par \uc2 RM: That's a form of strength.\par \par \uc2 DKG: Where \uc2 Trump\uc2  goes wrong is when he says, ''I have the best temperament of anyone who's ever run for president -- a winning temperament.'' That's completely a-historical. Our best presidents have all gone through adversity. Whether it's Lincoln's suicidal depression, or Teddy Roosevelt losing his wife and his mother on the same day in the same house, or F.D.R. getting polio, they all went through trials by fire and emerged stronger for it. Nobody wins all the time.\par \par \uc2 RM: It's also too on the nose. You can never say, ''I am humble.'' You have disproved the assertion by saying it. Same with ''best temperament ever.''\par \par \uc2 PG: Which president does Hillary most remind you of?\par \par \uc2 RM: Fascinating! It's so hard not to factor gender. Which dude is she most like?\par \par \uc2 DKG: It would have to be someone who had a lot of experience in different forms. Teddy Roosevelt probably came to the presidency with most experience: police commissioner, Civil Service commissioner, state legislator, governor, vice president, president. Bush Sr. also had a lot of title positions and brought an array of experiences.\par \par \uc2 RM: But there's often an alienation factor when people -- like Hillary or Bush Sr. -- come to you with all those experiences. They're no longer seen as a person to have a beer with. It makes it harder for people to empathize with them. I think George H. W. Bush suffered from that enormously.\par \par \uc2 DKG: They become personages rather than people.\par \par \uc2 PG: Have you met the candidates?\par \par \uc2 RM: I met Hillary in a professional capacity. I interviewed her. But what happened off-camera was almost more interesting. I don't think of her as an extrovert, but when we were done, she met every single person on set, my entire staff, the whole floor, including the cleaning crew. Shook hands, took pictures. She was being kind to people who had an interest in her. But to see her do that, willingly, at the end of her 11th event of the day, that surprised me.\par \par \uc2 PG: And \uc2 Trump\uc2 ?\par \par \uc2 RM: I've only spoken to \uc2 Trump\uc2  on the phone. He was warm and charming. I enjoyed talking to him. But a funny thing happened when I was negotiating with his staff. They insisted that the conversation was off the record. I could never even refer to the fact that it had happened. But at the end of it, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  said: ''Well, this has been a good conversation. You can run it.'' I said: ''I'm not taping it. Your people said I couldn't even refer to it.'' And he said, ''This wasn't on TV?''\par \par \uc2 PG: I bet you're a go-to person for candidates, Doris, with your presidential patina?\par \par \uc2 DKG: I was on the radio when my Roosevelt book came out, talking about how most of the action takes place on the second floor of the White House. Roosevelt invited all these people to live with them during World War II: His foreign policy adviser moved in and never left; Lorena Hickok, who had a crush on Eleanor; Princess Martha from Norway. Winston Churchill would stay for weeks at a time. So, I said, ''I'm obsessed with all the great conversations they must have had in their bathrobes.''\par \par \uc2 It turned out that Hillary was listening. She was in the White House then. And she called me up at the radio station and said: ''Come stay overnight at the White House, and we can figure out where everyone slept.'' And she followed up on her promise. So, the president and Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  and my husband and I go through every room on the second floor with my map, and we figure it out. Bill and Hillary were sleeping where F.D.R. was. And my husband and I are in Winston Churchill's room. No way could I sleep -- with Churchill in the corner, drinking his brandy and smoking his cigar.\par \par \uc2 RM: Have you stayed in touch with Hillary over the years?\par \par \uc2 DKG: Not for a while. I went to see her after they won the race in 1996. Chelsea was going off to school, and my kids had gone to college. We talked about missing them. And she told a funny story about Jackie Kennedy telling her which designers to wear. Hillary said, ''Clearly, I'm never figuring that out.'' She was very open.\par \par \uc2 RM: Does she seem different to you now?\par \par \uc2 DKG: Oh, I don't know. Maybe a little more defensive. But my guess is that if she's able to win, knowing: ''I'm the first female president of this country,'' that is such a huge thing. It's been totally overshadowed in this \uc2 election\uc2 . That would give her the confidence to say, ''I'm going to be like F.D.R. and meet the press twice a week.'' She could get out of that insular world.\par \par \uc2 PG: Let's stick with that: ambition and evolution. Most of us can track our ambitions in life to some childhood hurt: chilly parents, poverty. We work to overcome it. But when I talked with \uc2 Jimmy Carter\uc2  for this series, he spoke about a transformational moment -- a political defeat and deep depression -- that galvanized his desire to help all Americans. Does that happen with the great presidents?\par \par \uc2 RM: You mean, they stop thinking about themselves and start thinking of the world?\par \par \uc2 DKG: Without question. Lincoln was rare. He had it from the beginning. When he's 23 years old, he's already talking about leaving the world a better place for having lived in it. Franklin Roosevelt may have been president without polio. But once polio happened, he identified more with people whom fate had dealt an unkind hand. He was more empathetic than he would have been. Even L.B.J., who always had this strain of caring about ordinary people. He went for power after he lost the first senate race. Then he has an almost fatal heart attack in '55 and comes all the way back to his New Deal ambitions. He was more ready than we knew to be the liberal president.\par \par \uc2 PG: How about your ambitions?\par \par \uc2 DKG: My parents died when I was young -- my mother of a heart attack when I was 15, my father when I was in my 20s. I think it made me want to tell stories of people who were dead to somehow bring them back to life. I didn't think about it at the time. But it is stories that keep people alive. That's where my ambition for history came from.\par \par \uc2 RM: My ambitions were scattershot. I've never been a planner. I find myself with an opportunity and decide if I want to take it. Then I dig in. I just want to be good at it. And I'm more motivated by fear of failure than ambition to succeed.\par \par \uc2 PG: But that makes sense for someone who started as an AIDS activist.\par \par \uc2 RM: I grew up in the Bay Area, which was the epicenter of the AIDS epidemic. And when I came out, it was a community that was fighting for survival. People my age and immediately older were dying. There aren't many circumstances in life, unless you're in the military, when you know a lot of people in your marching order who die before you're 25. That's humbling in terms of ambition.\par \par \uc2 DKG: It does what Teddy Roosevelt did: It makes you want to do well whatever you're doing at that moment.\par \par \uc2 RM: Because you don't know if there's going to be another.\par \par \uc2 PG: It's the empathic crisis that \uc2 Jimmy Carter\uc2  talked about. Do you see that in Hillary or \uc2 Trump\uc2 ?\par \par \uc2 DKG: I see it in her. There's a doubleness of purpose there. That's what you're looking for in a good politician. Of course they want power. But you also hope that they want to do something with it. That's what L.B.J. said when he first got in: ''I'm not just going to strut to 'Hail to the Chief.' I want to do something for poor people, for black people.'' And when you look at what Hillary's done through her career, it's been there, too. She needs to communicate that: not just what she did for children, but what she wants to do for all of us.\par \par \uc2 PG: For a long time, I put irrational hatred of Hillary down to sexism.\par \par \uc2 RM: There's some of that.\par \par \uc2 PG: But hasn't it gotten worse? ''Lock her up! Lock her up!''\par \par \uc2 DKG: Hatred of ''the other'' has grown exponentially. It started with the \uc2 Clinton\uc2  impeachment, then the hatred of Bush, then the hatred of Obama. I agree, it's of a different level when you say, ''Put her in jail.'' But once I was on ''Meet the Press,'' and they put up this demographic map that showed that people don't even want to live near people who think differently than they do.\par \par \uc2 RM: That's a profound way to look at it. But there's a simpler way: We saw the partisan hatred directed towards Bill and also \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  when he was president. Now she's getting Round 2. Nobody else gets Round 2.\par \par \uc2 PG: At the beginning of the \uc2 Trump\uc2  phenomenon, I thought he was going to play it very ''Morning in America'': ''I've got a zillion dollars and a million friends with a thousand ideas to make things better.'' But it didn't go that way.\par \par \uc2 DKG: Because he's so vulnerable underneath.\par \par \uc2 RM: And it's turned very dark now that he's talking about \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  and the cabal of global elites. I heard that speech before. It was translated.\par \par \uc2 PG: And now the \uc2 election\uc2  rigging ----\par \par \uc2 RM: But let's imagine \uc2 Trump\uc2  wins. Anything can happen. Is there anything about him that could be a good building block for a leader?\par \par \uc2 DKG: You just have to hope. The worrisome thing is that we keep imagining that he's going to become presidential at some point, that he'll put behind him all the things he says about people, that he won't react so personally. Then he keeps doing it.\par \par \uc2 RM: One thing that's underappreciated about \uc2 Trump\uc2  is his sense of humor.\par \par \uc2 DKG: Where do you see this?\par \par \uc2 RM: When he talks about how great he is, sometimes I think he's doing it in a self-deprecating way. And that makes me worry less about what seem to be his toxic insecurities.\par \par \uc2 DKG: Well, he has been a master at breaking news.\par \par \uc2 RM: Which is a kind of political genius, orchestrating coverage the way he has, if you don't care about seeming offensive or hurting your party.\par \par \uc2 PG: Really?\par \par \uc2 RM: Look, I'm not persuading you. I'm just trying to imagine him as president and prepare for it as a country.\par \par \uc2 DKG: There's something about the office. In 2000, there was a fear that George W. Bush would never be a legitimate president. But he was, despite that incredible \uc2 election\uc2  and how it looked like it would shadow him. Something happens when they get in the presidency.\par \par \uc2 RM: And the worry with George W. was not just legitimacy. It was whether he was mature enough and intelligent enough to do the job. Then he got in there and did it.\par \par \uc2 DKG: He was a fuller person, we now know. Whether or not we agree with the decisions he made, he did fill the presidency. I guess that's what you have to hope if \uc2 Trump\uc2  wins.\par \par \uc2 PG: But look at how everyone is gripping the table.\par \par \uc2 Continue following our fashion and lifestyle coverage on \uc2 Facebook\uc2  (Styles and Modern Love), \uc2 Twitter\uc2  (Styles, Fashion and Weddings) and \uc2 Instagram\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Correction: November 6, 2016, Sunday\par \par \uc2 This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: The Table for Three interview last Sunday featuring Doris Kearns Goodwin and Rachel Maddow misstated the surname of the Democratic nominee for president in 1896, 1900 and 1908.

Summoned by his party to heal its fractious majority in the House, Mr. Ryan grudgingly agreed to lead. Asked by House members to help them win re-\uc2 election\uc2 , he raised money by the millions and traveled thousands of miles to campaign at their side.\par \par \uc2 But with elections not even two weeks away, Mr. Ryan finds that his feuding with \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , the Republican presidential nominee, has threatened not only the largest Republican majority in the House since the 1930s, but also his speakership itself.\par \par \uc2 For Mr. Ryan, the arc of the past four years -- from vice-presidential pick of \uc2 Mitt Romney\uc2  to object of Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's scorn -- represents perhaps the best measure of the chaos the \uc2 Trump\uc2  candidacy has wrought within the party.\par \par \uc2 In the weeks since Mr. Ryan said that he would no longer defend Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  or campaign for him, he has heard some mutinous rumblings among his members -- a smattering of dissent that may mean little unless Democrats can claim about 20 seats in this \uc2 election\uc2 , at the upper end of analysts' predictions.\par \par \uc2 If Democrats do gain 20 seats, Mr. Ryan can afford to lose just nine Republican votes if he hopes to retain the speakership in the next Congress.\par \par \uc2 As he travels the country, Mr. Ryan is choosing venues that are both safe and welcoming, trying to avoid additional comment on the turbulent presidential race.\par \par \uc2 In a cramped campaign office here in California's Central Valley, filled with young, exuberant volunteers -- and a crush of reporters craning their necks to see whatever they can see from a makeshift pen several yards away -- Mr. Ryan is free to act as if this is the policy-driven \uc2 election\uc2  he craved.\par \par \uc2 ''\uc2 Paul Ryan\uc2  wants desperately to become the leader of what he sees as a new, young Republican Party,'' said Heather Cox Richardson, a Boston College history professor and author of ''To Make Men Free: A History of the Republican Party.''\par \par \uc2 The problem, she said, is that this \uc2 election\uc2  season constitutes a shift in which Republicans must come to grips with the factions tearing the party apart, a fight Mr. Ryan may not survive.\par \par \uc2 ''I think it's a pipe dream,'' she added.\par \par \uc2 As Mr. Ryan bounded through a side door at Representative Jeff Denham's campaign headquarters here on Thursday, high-pitched cheers pierced the room as dozens of teenage volunteers hoisted their phones for a shot of the speaker.\par \par \uc2 But Mr. Ryan, who posed for one selfie after another during a 20-minute visit, emphasized that he wanted the \uc2 election\uc2  to be about policies, not personalities.\par \par \uc2 ''It becomes a personality contest,'' he said. ''Don't forget that underneath this is an ideas contest.''\par \par \uc2 But he also offered a line that could have been directed at Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 : ''We have show horses and we have workhorses. Be-ers and doers. People who want to be on TV, people who want to be famous, people for whom it's sort of a vanity thing. And then you have people who really care about ideas.''\par \par \uc2 For the most part, though, Mr. Ryan has stuck to feel-good language on the campaign trail, where he has made more than 50 appearances in House districts.\par \par \uc2 He was in New York, raising money for Representative Scott Garrett of New Jersey; in Miami, sipping cafecito at a Cuban restaurant and talking to volunteers with Representative Carlos Curbelo of Florida; and back home at a fall festival, campaigning for Senator Ron Johnson of Wisconsin -- and, conspicuously, not Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , who was set to appear until the release of a 2005 recording of him speaking in vulgar terms about women prompted Mr. Ryan to disinvite him.\par \par \uc2 By mid-October, Mr. Ryan had raised more than $48.2 million this year, transferring more than $31 million of it to the National Republican Congressional Committee, the party's House campaign arm.\par \par \uc2 Republicans needed the money because they have received little help from Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , financial or otherwise, leaving Mr. Ryan and Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, to shoulder much of the fund-raising.\par \par \uc2 Aides say Mr. McConnell has spent much of his time at private fund-raisers and working the phones -- maintaining his own distance from questions about Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , whom he also endorsed.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  offered only tepid encouragement for voters to support vulnerable down-ballot Republicans this week. ''You have to get out and vote, and that includes helping me re-elect Republicans all over the place,'' he said during a recent campaign stop in Florida.\par \par \uc2 ''I hope they help me, too. Be nice if they help us, too, right?''\par \par \uc2 At the same time, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  has done as much as anyone to stoke misgivings about Mr. Ryan. Referring to him as ''our very weak and ineffective leader'' on \uc2 Twitter\uc2  after the speaker said he would no longer defend or campaign for him, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  has suggested that Mr. Ryan should be punished, an opinion that some Republicans share.\par \par \uc2 After Mr. Ryan announced his new stance toward Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , Representative Steve King, Republican of Iowa, said that while he respected the speaker, he was not sure if he would support his continuation in that role. ''I think this was a wrong move to make,'' he said in an Oct. 11 interview with MSNBC.\par \par \uc2 ''It divides the party instead of unifies it. And it almost sacrifices the presidency,'' he added.\par \par \uc2 Publicly, many House Republicans have expressed support for Mr. Ryan, even some of those in the House Freedom Caucus, a group of conservatives who helped press former Speaker \uc2 John A. Boehner\uc2  into retirement and have fought with Mr. Ryan over such issues as a short-term funding extension to keep the government running.\par \par \uc2 Many of them have expressed appreciation for his openness to members' concerns, and at least two members in tough re-\uc2 election\uc2  races -- Mr. Garrett and Representative Rod Blum of Iowa -- have directly benefited from his fund-raising.\par \par \uc2 Many of the group's members have signed a letter petitioning to delay leadership elections, which are scheduled to take place promptly upon Congress's return the week after \uc2 Election\uc2  Day.\par \par \uc2 The fact that Mr. Ryan only reluctantly agreed to be speaker after intense wooing from fellow Republicans has raised the prospect that he may not put up a fight to keep his position as the highest-ranking elected Republican in the House. But his spokeswoman, AshLee Strong, said he plans to run for speaker again.\par \par \uc2 ''Speaker Ryan has worked hard to unify members behind conservative ideas, but his only focus until Nov. 8 is defeating Democrats and protecting the House Republican majority,'' she said in a statement.\par \par \uc2 The nagging problem is that there appear to be few viable alternatives to Mr. Ryan should even a dozen House Republicans decide to revolt against him, a reality that may keep some dissenters in line. Ryan supporters are hoping that he is playing a smart long game to survive the rise of Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Mr. Ryan does hold an unmistakable appeal, or at least inspires curiosity, among many young people on the campaign trail -- some of them not yet old enough to vote.\par \par \uc2 As Mr. Ryan's small motorcade sped off, Desiree Cruz, 15, said, ''It seems so unreal to actually be in his presence.''\par \par \uc2 Just inside the door, Claire Neimann, 17, a soft-spoken volunteer for Mr. Denham's campaign, said she was struck by what Mr. Ryan could represent for her party.\par \par \uc2 ''I think he's a new hope, because everyone's been so divided lately with \uc2 Trump\uc2  running,'' Ms. Neimann said.\par \par \uc2 Speaker Paul D. Ryan aims to help Republicans hold a House majority. To that end, he has made more than 50 appearances in House districts, including a Thursday visit to Representative Jeff Denham's campaign headquarters in Modesto, Calif.

\par\par \uc2 OPINION\par \uc2 Sunday Review Desk; SECTSR\par \b \uc2 Why \uc2 Trump\uc2  Stays Afloat\b0\par\par\uc2 By SAM WANG \par \uc2 1,397 \uc2 words\par \uc2 30 October 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 2\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 In one of the most emotionally wrenching presidential races in living memory, \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's support is as level as a pond. In polls, it is holding steady around 41 percent, right where it was after the first debate in late September. This plateau has persisted through the second and third debates with his opponent, \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , and the revelation of his recorded boasts of sexual assault. Even the stunning public rebuke of Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  by the parents of the Iraq war hero Capt. Humayun Khan in late July was followed by a swing of just a few percentage points, quite small by historical standards. Why has Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's support not collapsed further in the face of some fairly damning revelations?\par \par \uc2 Such high stability in polls is not new. It started several decades ago. One measure of the stasis of modern campaigns is how much each party's support in polls changes over the course of a campaign. From 1952 to 1992, the average range -- the difference between maximum and minimum levels of support -- was 17 percentage points. Since 1996, the range has dropped to 8 points. Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's range is 4 points, from 39 to 43 percent.\par \par \uc2 At his lowest point, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  still had more support than George McGovern, who got the smallest percentage of the popular vote by a major party candidate in the postwar era in 1972, with 38 percent. Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's average margin over Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  of five points has been enough to make her the first candidate to maintain a durable lead in an open presidential race since Dwight D. Eisenhower defeated Adlai Stevenson in 1952. So the bigger question is not about Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , but why the last six presidential campaigns became so stable.\par \par \uc2 The answer is polarization. The same forces that propel a radical candidate to a party's nomination also provide a floor through which he is unlikely to fall. Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's ascent is the culmination of trends that began in the 1990s, when \uc2 Newt Gingrich\uc2  introduced the Contract With America, and adopted tactics like government shutdowns and impeachment. More than any national figure since \uc2 Sarah Palin\uc2 , Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  embodies these attitudes.\par \par \uc2 The founders thought that a physically far-flung Republic would avoid such ''mischiefs of faction.'' In The Federalist No. 10, James Madison suggested that the slowness of communication between distant states would prevent the formation of organized factions inflamed ''with mutual animosity.'' But modern communication has rendered Madison's point of view obsolete. At the same time that voting patterns stabilized in the 1990s, instant long-distance communication allowed the coordination of message and ideology across long distances -- and Republicans are more likely to be found in sparsely populated areas.\par \par \uc2 Madison thought that even if a faction shared common motives, physical distance would make it difficult ''to discover their own strength, and to act in unison with each other.'' Partisan media is not new, of course -- in the 1800s, the chief funding for newspapers came from political parties -- but talk radio, Fox News and Breitbart can reach like-minded voters with tremendous speed. Social media intensifies the segregation of voters by providing channels of communication tailored to specific preferences. When cable news organizations often seem unwilling to call out falsehoods, wrong information can cause tremendous damage. Technology has made Madison's vast republic virtually small.\par \par \uc2 Communication goes two ways, and Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  takes this to an extreme. A reality TV star and a leader in the birther movement, he quickly became the first choice of a plurality of Republican voters from the start of his candidacy in 2015. He is adept at using \uc2 Twitter\uc2  to send messages to his nearly 13 million followers. Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's success with Republican voters at odds with the party establishment can be explained by the fact that he is one of them, raised up to be their nominee. They will not abandon him, any more than they would abandon themselves.\par \par \uc2 Voter entrenchment is maintained in part by negative feelings about the opposition. Such warfare takes a toll. The approval ratings of both major nominees have declined steadily over the last 20 years, and Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  is the most negatively viewed nominee that Gallup has ever recorded. Democratic-leaning voters and many college-educated Republicans find it unthinkable to support Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  given his appeals to racial and anti-immigrant resentment. In 2012, \uc2 Mitt Romney\uc2  came with the baggage of his party; in 2016, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  is baggage personified.\par \par \uc2 For this reason, Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's support is unlikely to flag even as her email has again attracted the attention of the F.B.I. Likewise, for committed Republicans, support for Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  is out of the question. In a Florida survey, 84 percent of \uc2 Trump\uc2  voters said that Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  should be in prison, and 40 percent said she was a demon.\par \par \uc2 With polarization, many voters' preferences have become predictable from their social and cultural characteristics. Even so-called undecided voters are more decided than they realize. It has been suggested that the Republican Party is motivated today not by political conservatism, but a reaction against contemporary life. \uc2 Trump\uc2  voters resemble Romney and McCain voters. They are whites who are more likely to be evangelicals who did not graduate from college. Tensions between these groups and elites and minorities limits the range of support that either side's candidate will receive.\par \par \uc2 Partisan geography has become more fixed, too. In terms of patterns of relative strength and weakness, the electoral map is more stable than it has been in 50 years. For this reason, talk of Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's winning Texas is overblown. If that happens, I promise to eat a bug.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's candidacy has revolved almost entirely around emotionally powerful issues like race, immigration and anti-Muslim sentiment. The more you feel a decision in your gut, the less likely it is that you will change your mind. White nationalists think white nationalism is great, but others are repelled. And in a Raycom/Mason-Dixon poll of the Louisiana Senate race, supporters of the white supremacist David Duke favored Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  over Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  by a margin of 81 percent to 6 percent.\par \par \uc2 Voter polarization translates easily to extreme legislative bodies. In any district dominated by one party, representatives are determined mainly in primary elections, when turnout is low and the most likely voters are motivated partisans, fulfilling Madison's fear that ''a common passion or interest will, in almost every case, be felt by a majority.'' By numerical measures of ideological intensity, from the 1970s to the 1990s, centrism steadily disappeared from the House Republican caucus. Single-party domination has expanded since 2012 because of increased partisan gerrymandering, which eliminated dozens of competitive districts. These trends suggest that partisan gridlock will continue long after \uc2 Election\uc2  Day.\par \par \uc2 Although technology has contributed to polarization, it may also help rescue us. For example, \uc2 Facebook\uc2  has automated story selection for its custom news feed; for political news this tends to foster an echo-chamber effect. However, \uc2 Facebook\uc2  data scientists have found a better source of diversity: almost 30 percent of hard-news reports originating from friends reflect opposing views. Even better, individuals are likelier to engage with information like this when it is presented in a social context.\par \par \uc2 For now, we are stuck with an intensely emotional campaign that has been a significant source of stress for more than half of adults. The \uc2 American Psychological Association\uc2  has, for the first time, issued tips on dealing with \uc2 election\uc2 -related stress. Strong emotional experience reduces mental flexibility, suggesting that when tempers run high, as they have for many voters this season, entrenched support for a party or candidate is more likely. So if you wonder whether there is anyone left to persuade, the answer is probably no. We're too freaked out.\par \par \uc2 Follow The \uc2 New York Times\uc2  Opinion section on \uc2 Facebook\uc2  and \uc2 Twitter\uc2  (@NYTopinion), and sign up for the Opinion Today newsletter.\par \par \uc2 Sam Wang is a professor of neuroscience and molecular biology at Princeton and a founder of the Princeton Election Consortium .\par \par \uc2 CHART: A Widening Gulf: While many party constituencies grew more entrenched after 1992, one group seems to have made a sharp U-turn: white college graduates.

\par\par \uc2 Real Estate Desk; SECTRE\par \b \uc2 A Brand Tarnished by the \uc2 Election\b0\par\par\uc2 By JACOB BERNSTEIN \par \uc2 1,759 \uc2 words\par \uc2 30 October 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 1\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 When Harvey Koeppel and his wife, Peggy Koeppel, bought their three-bedroom apartment on the 12th floor of \uc2 Trump\uc2  Place at 200 Riverside Boulevard in 2000, it seemed like a solid investment.\par \par \uc2 With Hudson River views and amenities that include a full-time doorman, concierge desk, a gym filled with the latest Life Fitness equipment and a pool that eventually got its own waterfall, they thought they'd found the perfect spot to raise their son.\par \par \uc2 A trove of celebrities -- including Kathleen Turner, Bruce Willis, Kristin Chenoweth and Montel Williams -- moved into \uc2 Trump\uc2  condominium buildings in the complex, increasing the sense of panache.\par \par \uc2 In 2012, the Obamas even made an appearance, darting into the neighboring 220 Riverside Boulevard for a re-\uc2 election\uc2  fund-raiser.\par \par \uc2 The Koeppels were never huge fans of \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , but gave little thought to the fact that their home carried his name.\par \par \uc2 Until the 2016 \uc2 election\uc2 . This summer, the couple, who were in the process of retiring and moving full time to their country house in Rhinebeck, N.Y., listed their apartment with \uc2 the Corcoran Group\uc2  for $2.85 million.\par \par \uc2 Two people showed up at their open house in late September. No one made an offer, even after the Koeppels dropped their price by $55,000. Then, in mid-October, their broker suggested cutting the price by another $100,000 and they decided to delist it.\par \par \uc2 ''We're taking it off the market,'' Mr. Koeppel said. ''My sense is that there's a definite negative impact to having \uc2 Trump\uc2 's name there right now. For me personally, I'm embarrassed to tell people I live in a \uc2 Trump\uc2  building.''\par \par \uc2 While there are other factors that may explain why the Koeppels' apartment has had no takers -- $3,711 in monthly common charges and real estate taxes is no small sum -- the couple is not alone in thinking this caustic campaign season has had an unforeseen effect on the Manhattan residential properties that carry the \uc2 Trump\uc2  name.\par \par \uc2 Just south of Mr. Koeppel's condo, at three neighboring buildings that are largely rentals, residents are attempting to have Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's name removed from the properties, the doormen's uniforms and the lobby floor mats.\par \par \uc2 And north, at 220 Riverside Drive, Ian Shrank, the owner of a 1,900-square-foot 36th-floor condo, has been petitioning to have the \uc2 Trump\uc2  name removed from that building. So far, those efforts have not borne fruit, and Mr. Shrank declined to comment, saying that any attempt to discuss the matter could only lead to more unwanted publicity for the building he loves and the name on it that he doesn't.\par \par \uc2 But in a letter to shareholders dated Oct. 14, the condo board explained it was rejecting Mr. Shrank's petition because it does not have the authority to adjudicate the matter, and that a decision to change the name would require a two-thirds majority vote. (Only 57 owners out of about 400 signed the original petition posted on Brick Underground.)\par \par \uc2 There are clearly dissenters arguing to keep well enough alone. Abe Botha, an associate broker at \uc2 Douglas Elliman Real Estate\uc2  who has sold several dozen apartments at Riverside Boulevard, said he was more concerned about the larger New York real estate economy than about fallout from the presidential race.\par \par \uc2 ''There's an overall softening,'' he said, adding that Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  still has his supporters, including some on Riverside Boulevard who see having the \uc2 Trump\uc2  name as a bonus. ''There are plenty of people who would purchase in one of the \uc2 Trump\uc2  buildings, probably as many as who wouldn't.''\par \par \uc2 Mr. Botha did not seem eager to mention in an interview that he is an owner at Riverside Boulevard as well as a broker there.\par \par \uc2 And there was Mr. Botha on a perfect Sunday afternoon, sitting in the lobby of 200 Riverside Boulevard, thumbing his smartphone as he waited for someone to come and fall in love with the $1.01 million 11th-floor one-bedroom that he represents and that has now been on the market for more than four months.\par \par \uc2 Nearby was a broker from Corcoran, taking what may be a last whack at trying to sell the Koeppels' apartment. How was that going, a reporter asked. ''Slow,'' said the broker, who did not wish to be identified.\par \par \uc2 There is increasing data to suggest that potential homeowners may be wary about buying in properties carrying the \uc2 Trump\uc2  name. Over the last two years, the amount of available inventory from \uc2 Trump\uc2 -branded residential buildings in Manhattan has stayed relatively constant, according to listings pulled from StreetEasy.com.\par \par \uc2 For the 12 months ending October 2015, there were 159 apartments sold at 10 \uc2 Trump\uc2  condominiums, including a $21.38 million penthouse at \uc2 Trump\uc2  Park Avenue that was sold by Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  shortly after announcing his candidacy. That number on StreetEasy fell to 117 sales for the period between November 2015 and October 2016, a drop of more than 26 percent. The decrease is especially notable when compared with the performance of the overall Manhattan resale condo market, which showed an increase of 3.8 percent.\par \par \uc2 To Michael Vargas, a principal of the Manhattan-based Vanderbilt Appraisal Company, the data had clear indications. ''Absorption rates are a pretty good way to look at this,'' he said. ''There has been a reassessment of that brand, on the part of property owners. Where that brand used to enhance value, it is now being perceived as a detraction to value. It's a slowdown in the real estate market combined with a negative view of the brand.''\par \par \uc2 At \uc2 Trump\uc2  Park Avenue, the 30-plus-story former hotel that Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  purchased in 2002 and converted into condos, 10 apartments sold last year while eight were delisted. This year, six apartments sold and 18 units were listed but later taken off the market, according to StreetEasy.\par \par \uc2 The condominium buildings on Riverside Boulevard told a similar story, with the number of listings taken off the market rising to 82 from 67, even as available units inched downward. This was also the case at \uc2 Trump\uc2  International, the 44-story condominium tower at the northern tip of Columbus Circle, where six of 14 units sold this year, compared with 14 of 20 last year.\par \par \uc2 ''I can't see any good near-term or long-term effect for this campaign on \uc2 Trump\uc2 's real estate brand,'' said Robert Dankner, the president of Prime Manhattan Residential. ''Does the \uc2 election\uc2  bring attention to \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2 's brand?'' Mr. Dankner said. ''Yes. Does it increase the good will toward his brand? No. He's turning a lot of people off, with his divisive statements that are directed toward specific nationalities and religions.''\par \par \uc2 Still, few brokers who have sold apartments in \uc2 Trump\uc2  buildings seem willing to go as far as Mr. Dankner, citing both Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's long history of lawsuits and Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's son-in-law \uc2 Jared Kushner\uc2 's standing in the real estate community, thanks in part to his status as the owner of the New York Observer.\par \par \uc2 David B. Dubin of \uc2 Douglas Elliman\uc2 , who is a broker of a $2.195 million apartment at \uc2 Trump\uc2  Tower that has been on the market for more than nine months, said only, ''I don't want to discuss the \uc2 election\uc2 .''\par \par \uc2 Repeated attempts to obtain comment from representatives of Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  were unsuccessful.\par \par \uc2 Nikki Sun, another \uc2 Douglas Elliman\uc2  agent, who listed a unit at \uc2 Trump\uc2  SoHo, a hotel and residential condominium, was more forthcoming. Back when the cozy 11th-floor hotel room at the \uc2 Trump\uc2  SoHo first went on the market in the winter of 2014, the seller was asking $949,000, Ms. Sun said. Numerous price reductions followed, and two real estate brokers came and went as the unit's price dropped to $900,000, and then $800,000, before hitting $799,000; it was subsequently taken off the market.\par \par \uc2 Selling the property has been ''a huge problem,'' Ms. Sun said. ''My owner bought it for around $1.025 million. Now she's taking a huge loss.''\par \par \uc2 As Ms. Sun was quick to note, her problems with the listing extend beyond Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's campaign and include the fact that some major banks do not lend to buyers in hotel/condo buildings. But, she added, ''I have international buyers who said right away, 'I do not want to be associated with \uc2 Trump\uc2  anything.' ''\par \par \uc2 At \uc2 Trump\uc2  Tower, it is particularly hard to argue that Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's dominance of the news cycle is bringing the sort of attention buyers and sellers crave. Paparazzi line up outside regularly to catch Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  entering and leaving the building, where he lives in a three-floor, marble accented penthouse. Protesters parade by, carrying slogans that refer in explicit terms to both Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  and his opponent, \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 The human genome researcher William Haseltine, who for several years owned a 4,719-square-foot condo in \uc2 Trump\uc2  World Tower at 845 United Nations Plaza, sold his 86th-floor apartment for $14.8 million in January, long before the campaign reached its zenith. ''I think there is an effect,'' he said, of the \uc2 election\uc2 , especially considering the building's sales pitch to foreign dignitaries. ''Just before you called, my wife and I were talking about how we were pleased we sold it when we did, because if we had it to sell it now, it would be worth perhaps 30 percent less.''\par \par \uc2 Carl Giuseppone, a former owner at \uc2 Trump\uc2  World Tower, said that ''when \uc2 Trump\uc2  is alienating a lot of people because of his rhetoric, it gets very difficult to move property.''\par \par \uc2 But Don Reiss, a 71-year-old homeowner and lifelong Democrat at 220 Riverside Boulevard, remains optimistic this will blow over.\par \par \uc2 ''It's like buying a stock that goes down for a little while,'' Mr. Reiss said.\par \par \uc2 Perhaps that explains why the seller of a $35 million penthouse at \uc2 Trump\uc2  Park Avenue delisted the apartment back in December after having no luck finding a buyer in the current market.\par \par \uc2 The owner's name? \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Apartment owners at \uc2 Trump\uc2  World Tower, at 845 United Nations Plaza, say the \uc2 election\uc2  is having an effect on sales.

\par\par \uc2 Money and Business/Financial Desk; SECTBU\par \b \uc2 The Power of Small Factories\b0\par\par\uc2 By NELSON D. SCHWARTZ \par \uc2 3,019 \uc2 words\par \uc2 30 October 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 1\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 BALTIMORE -- James Branch's life seemed destined to follow a familiar arc in the streets that surround the Marlin Steel factory, where he bends metal from sunrise until near dark.\par \par \uc2 He fathered a child while in high school, dropped out, then spent a dozen years selling drugs. He went to prison and, afterward, squatted in abandoned houses in West Baltimore. He worked the fryer at Popeyes and fought the temptation to go back to dealing on street corners that many Americans will know from the television series ''The Wire.''\par \par \uc2 Fortunately, things turned around for Mr. Branch.\par \par \uc2 Now 40, he earns just over $20 an hour as a skilled machine operator at Marlin Steel, a small maker of specialized metal baskets used by much bigger manufacturers like \uc2 Ford Motor\uc2 , \uc2 Boeing\uc2  and Merck. He owns a car, rents a two-story townhouse with an airy backyard and recently watched the daughter he fathered at 16 as she graduated from college with a degree in psychology.\par \par \uc2 What altered Mr. Branch's fate? There was his own discipline, of course, like completing a two-year course in metalwork between his shifts at Popeyes. Or getting up at 3:45 a.m. and taking three buses to avoid being late for his first factory job.\par \par \uc2 But his success is also because of the unlikely survival of Marlin Steel, a rare breed: the urban industrial manufacturer.\par \par \uc2 Marlin is a thriving factory in a place that, over the last half-century, factories have fled -- first to the South, and later to Asia. That flight haunts the United States perhaps most in its urban areas -- especially neighborhoods that once housed the nation's working class -- and helps explain why many African-Americans in particular today live in poverty in metropolises like Baltimore, Detroit, Newark and St. Louis.\par \par \uc2 The idea of manufacturing things maintains a powerful grip on the American psyche in politics and economics, and in the notion that selling burgers isn't a path to the middle class. It is also at odds with cold, hard statistics.\par \par \uc2 Despite the candidates' \uc2 election\uc2 -year promises, factories will never employ the masses of Americans they once did. Automation and foreign competition will not abate no matter who occupies the Oval Office. Over the last 20 years, industrial employment has dropped by nearly one-third. Only 12.3 million Americans work in the sector today, millions fewer than in leisure and hospitality, for instance, the category that includes frying chicken at Popeyes.\par \par \uc2 But small manufacturers like Marlin are vital if the United States is to narrow the nation's class divide and build a society that offers greater opportunities for everyone -- rich and poor, black and white, high school graduates and Ph.D.s.\par \par \uc2 ''The closing of factories has taken the rungs out of the ladder for reaching the middle class in urban areas,'' said Robert A. Johnson, a former hedge fund investor who is now president of the Institute for New Economic Thinking, a liberal research group. Many service jobs do not pay as well, nor do they offer the same opportunities for advancement.\par \par \uc2 And as the service sector has expanded in recent decades, less educated workers in big cities have largely been bypassed as demand has grown for well-compensated professionals in what Mr. Johnson calls F.T.E., or finance, technology and electronics.\par \par \uc2 ''Manufacturing jobs involve a skill base that you develop over time, and that fortifies your negotiating strength,'' Mr. Johnson said. But in lower-skilled jobs, the competition is with someone who will do the same work for less. ''The marketplace doesn't give you any leverage,'' he said.\par \par \uc2 Hope for Troubled Cities\par \par \uc2 Today, smaller plants are particularly important to job creation in factory work, said Scott Paul, president of the Alliance for American Manufacturing. ''Megafactories are the exception today,'' Mr. Paul said. ''Small manufacturing is holding its own -- and you are seeing some interesting developments in urban centers.''\par \par \uc2 Out of 252,000 manufacturing companies in the United States, only 3,700 had more than 500 workers. The vast majority employ fewer than 20.\par \par \uc2 While they may not rival the scale of 1950s assembly lines, these smaller craft-type producers hold out hope for cities, Mr. Paul said, particularly as some companies look to move jobs back from overseas to be closer to customers and more nimble to supply customized, small-batch orders.\par \par \uc2 What is more, these jobs pay people more. According to the \uc2 Bureau of Labor Statistics\uc2 , manufacturing workers typically earn just over $26 an hour. By contrast, medical orderlies and nurse's assistants (a growing field) earn half as much. And fast food, a mainstay for Americans with a high school diploma or less, has a median hourly wage of $9.11.\par \par \uc2 For Mr. Branch, this is not abstract economics.\par \par \uc2 ''This changed my life,'' he said, standing next to one of the machines he operates, which can cost up to $300,000 each. ''I went from minimum wage at Popeyes to making almost 70K a year. They're proud of me in my old neighborhood. They say I made it out.''\par \par \uc2 With the rise of \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , much of the economic debate during the presidential campaign has centered on the anger and economics of the white working class in the Rust Belt and elsewhere. That is partly because blue-collar whites were especially hard hit by factory closures in the last decade, largely as a result of competition from China and the savage recession eight years ago.\par \par \uc2 But it was the black working class that was devastated first, by a decades-long decline of manufacturing employment.\par \par \uc2 As the sociologist William Julius Wilson has written in his classic studies, ''The Truly Disadvantaged'' and ''When Work Disappears,'' the exodus of factories from high-cost, union-dominated cities to cheaper, less union-friendly locales in the South and West in the 1960s and 1970s played a major role in the breakdown of urban cores.\par \par \uc2 ''The trends among non-college-educated, white Americans today look like a lot like the trends among black Americans in the 1970s that so worried policy makers and social scientists,'' said David Autor, a professor of economics at M.I.T., who researches the connections among trade, labor and employment. ''You see it in the falling labor force participation, the decline of traditional family structure, crime and poverty. It's all there.''\par \par \uc2 While some cities, including Boston, Chicago, New York and Pittsburgh, have managed to rebound in recent years, Baltimore remains mired in a cycle of economic and social dysfunction. Unemployment among young black men tops 35 percent, compared with 31 percent nationally, and among large cities, Baltimore experienced the largest percentage increase in murders in the nation over the last two years.\par \par \uc2 For Marlin and its 24 employees, all of this hit close to home when riots swept the city in April 2015 after Freddie Gray, a 25-year-old black resident of West Baltimore, died in police custody. Stores were looted not far from the industrial park that's home to Marlin. The police enforced a nightly curfew.\par \par \uc2 One Marlin employee, Joshua Wallace, an Iraq War veteran who serves in the National Guard, was called to duty and had to patrol the streets instead of manning the computerized cutting machine. The factory's night shift, which runs seven days a week, was shut down because Marlin's workers couldn't come or go after dark.\par \par \uc2 ''I didn't want my guys to get shot,'' said \uc2 Drew Greenblatt\uc2 , Marlin's owner.\par \par \uc2 In addition to uniquely local challenges like these, Marlin -- along with plenty of other small manufacturing companies -- faces a forbidding landscape simply because of its size. ''I'm not \uc2 Under Armour\uc2 . I can't get concessions,'' Mr. Greenblatt said, referring to how the giant sports clothing company will benefit from hundreds of millions of dollars in tax breaks and other subsidies as part of a plan to build a new headquarters here.\par \par \uc2 At the same time, he does not possess squads of accountants and lawyers or foreign subsidiaries that can be used to lower Marlin's tax payments -- strategies most Fortune 500 companies use to cut their taxes far below the official rate.\par \par \uc2 Then there is the soaring cost of health insurance and other benefits, which Marlin provides, unlike many other low-wage service employers. Factory jobs tend to come with benefits -- 92 percent of manufacturing employees have access to employer-sponsored health care plans compared with 79 percent of workers over all.\par \par \uc2 Health care coverage for Marlin's two dozen workers costs nearly $100,000 annually, up from about $45,000 five years ago, or about the cost of two additional employees. ''It's unbelievable how much is out of my control,'' Mr. Greenblatt said. ''It's mind-boggling how many obstacles there are in our way. But these people are depending on me.''\par \par \uc2 Evolving to Survive\par \par \uc2 Marlin Steel is nearly a half-century old, but today it bears little resemblance to what Mr. Greenblatt found when he bought the company in 1998. ''It was right out of a Charles Dickens novel,'' Mr. Greenblatt said, describing Marlin's old factory, then in the Red Hook section of Brooklyn. ''Everything was done by hand, but there were guys missing eyes and fingers. It was dangerous, and health care coverage meant going to the emergency room.''\par \par \uc2 For the first three decades of Marlin's existence, the company almost exclusively made simple, sturdy, welded-wire bagel baskets. As the Jewish breakfast staple exploded in popularity outside the Northeast, Marlin prospered along with it.\par \par \uc2 But by the early 2000s, the bagel craze was fading, and the popularity of the Atkins diet and carb-phobia started hurting bagel sales. China's entry into the \uc2 World Trade Organization\uc2  in 2001 presented traditional manufacturers -- and what is more old-school than bagel baskets? -- with an existential threat.\par \par \uc2 Chinese versions of Marlin's products were selling for $6 each, or less than what the steel alone cost in Marlin's baskets. The other $5 that Marlin charged, to cover salaries, taxes, equipment and a sliver of profit, was now just red ink.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Greenblatt did what organisms threatened with extinction have always done to survive: He evolved.\par \par \uc2 He moved the factory to Baltimore in 1999, with eight of his Brooklyn employees following him, including one who is still working on the floor. Then he began going after what economists call value-added goods, products that were more specialized and sophisticated what than the Chinese were making, and therefore able to command higher prices.\par \par \uc2 But producing baskets with very specific requirements, or tolerances, as they are known, for automakers or aerospace giants could not be achieved by hand. ''If a bagel falls out the bottom, that's 10 cents,'' Mr. Greenblatt said. ''A single airplane part can cost thousands of dollars, so there's no room for error.''\par \par \uc2 Over the course of a decade, he invested in robots that churned out baskets almost a hundred times as fast as human beings. He trained his workers to operate the robots, which can cost hundreds of thousands of dollars each, and hired engineers to help design ever-more-sophisticated products to win customers and stay ahead of overseas rivals.\par \par \uc2 ''In Brooklyn, eight fellows could do 300 bends an hour,'' Mr. Greenblatt recalled. ''Now two guys running robots can do 25,000 bends per hour.''\par \par \uc2 Today, in fact, many of Marlin's robot-made baskets are designed specifically to be handled by other robots.\par \par \uc2 Automation did not mean the elimination of jobs -- in fact, it saved the company. But it does mean producing many more baskets with only a few more workers. So, while Marlin's revenue has grown to over $5 million today, from $800,000 when Mr. Greenblatt arrived, the company's work force has increased by just a third, to 24 people from 18 people.\par \par \uc2 Marlin's comeback isn't exactly a secret. In 2012, the Treasury secretary, Timothy F. Geithner, visited the plant. Mr. Greenblatt is a well-known booster in industry circles.\par \par \uc2 Less publicized is how the company's survival has transformed the lives of its workers, even as the Westport neighborhood around the factory, and other poor sections of Baltimore, remain deeply scarred. ''Some are dead, some are locked up,'' said Edward Derrill, 23, of the guys he grew up with in West Baltimore. ''I didn't want to end up like that.''\par \par \uc2 With an associate's degree in computer science from \uc2 Morgan State University\uc2 , a historically black college in Baltimore, workers like Mr. Derrill can earn at least $50,000 a year. Besides health insurance, they also have access to a 401(k) plan and two weeks' paid vacation, a rarity at many local employers.\par \par \uc2 ''You can work your way up and get raises,'' he said. Mr. Derrill hopes to become a team leader soon, supervising other workers. Marlin also pays for its employees to go back to school and get degrees in related subjects like engineering, giving workers who never had a chance to attend college additional options.\par \par \uc2 Nationwide and for men in particular, whether black or white, the erosion of manufacturing work has been especially devastating.\par \par \uc2 In the 1950s, says Lawrence Katz, a prominent labor economist at Harvard, nearly one-third of the men who went to work after high school were employed in factories. Those jobs and that era are never coming back, Mr. Katz said, ''but a job as a physical therapist or a home health aide doesn't fit the identity of someone who is a welder or a machinist.''\par \par \uc2 And while not all the workers at Marlin are men -- the split is about 80-20 -- for many blue-collar men there and elsewhere, the idea of working with one's hands and building things is closely connected to finding a purpose in life, and in the workplace. ''I call it an identity mismatch, and I think it's a huge issue for men,'' Mr. Katz said. ''Pure physical labor isn't much valued today, but we need to try and rebuild the service sector for men without college degrees.''\par \par \uc2 Brent Fox, 34, served with the Marine Corps in Iraq and is now the weekend shift supervisor at Marlin, a position that can pay well over $50,000 a year. While the money is a draw, Mr. Fox also said working in a service-type role doesn't appeal to him.\par \par \uc2 '''You want fries with that?' No way,'' he said. ''I like being able to take raw material and make it into something. There's pride in making things -- you don't get that in a lot of service jobs.''\par \par \uc2 New employers have appeared in Baltimore, including an Amazon warehouse that employs more than 3,000. But with hourly wages of over $15 an hour, that is still less than what most Marlin workers earn.\par \par \uc2 ''This isn't theoretical,'' Mr. Greenblatt said, shouting over the din of metal pounding on metal. ''Manufacturing bootstraps people out of poverty.''\par \par \uc2 'Honest, Hard Work'\par \par \uc2 Up Annapolis Road from the small industrial park that Marlin calls home, in the Westport neighborhood, the deindustrialization of urban America wreaked havoc. Derelict rowhouses line the streets, with rotting stoops and garbage-filled yards. Only 6 percent of residents have college degrees, and more than a quarter do not have a high school diploma.\par \par \uc2 ''Try to get a job,'' said John Brooks, who has lived in Westport for most of his 63 years. ''They won't hire people from here.''\par \par \uc2 Ticking off Baltimore employers of yesteryear -- like \uc2 Bethlehem Steel\uc2 , and Carr Lowrey, a glassmaker that shut its doors in 2003 after 114 years down by the Patapsco River -- Mr. Brooks shook his head.\par \par \uc2 ''\uc2 McDonald's\uc2 , you might not even get that,'' he said. ''There used to be plenty of factories here. You didn't even need a high school diploma to work at \uc2 Bethlehem Steel\uc2 .''\par \par \uc2 Once upon a time, Mr. Branch, the Marlin machine operator, also lacked a high school diploma. He earned one through an equivalency test, and later helped other prisoners earn their G.E.D.s during his time inside.\par \par \uc2 After Popeyes and his course at the Magna Baltimore Technical Training Center, Mr. Branch landed a job at \uc2 Crown Cork & Seal\uc2  in a suburb of Baltimore. ''I don't know if anyone else would have taken a chance on me,'' he said.\par \par \uc2 In the autumn of 2015, after 123 years of making cans in Baltimore, \uc2 Crown Cork & Seal\uc2  shut down the plant where Mr. Branch worked. But he was determined to find another manufacturing position and not go back to the streets.\par \par \uc2 ''The worst feeling in the world was watching my kids get up and leave after they visited me in prison,'' he recalled. ''I promised them I wouldn't put them through that again.''\par \par \uc2 Mr. Greenblatt had worked with \uc2 Magna\uc2 , and when a headhunter steered Mr. Branch to Marlin Steel, it was a natural fit. ''I like being creative,'' Mr. Branch said, as he entered figures that would determine the diameter and angles of the parts that his machine produces.\par \par \uc2 ''God gave me a lot of blessings,'' he said. ''When you lived that life on the corner, you never knew which day would be your last. Now I can come home, sit on my couch, look at my big-screen TV and appreciate it because it came from honest, hard work. That's a great feeling, and nothing can take that away.''\par \par \uc2 Top, a housing community near an industrial park in the Westport neighborhood of Baltimore.

\par\par \uc2 National Desk; SECTA\par \b \uc2 Leaks Lay Bare a Longtime \uc2 Clinton\uc2  Adviser's Unflinching Straight Talk\b0\par\par\uc2 By STEVE EDER and NICHOLAS CONFESSORE \par \uc2 1,320 \uc2 words\par \uc2 30 October 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 20\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 In one note, Neera Tanden groused that whoever had let \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  use a private email address for her State Department correspondence should be ''drawn and quartered.''\par \par \uc2 In another, she called for Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  to stop stalling on whether she opposed the Keystone pipeline, worrying that ''dodging another issue'' would hurt her in the Democratic primaries.\par \par \uc2 And when Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's team dallied over whether to publicly criticize David Brock, a longtime ally, for demanding Senator Bernie Sanders's medical records, Ms. Tanden was blunt.\par \par \uc2 ''Hillary. God,'' Ms. Tanden wrote. ''Her instincts are suboptimal.''\par \par \uc2 Ms. Tanden, 46, a longtime policy adviser to Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , is well known on \uc2 Twitter\uc2  and cable news for her peppery defenses of Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  and her sarcastic takedowns of Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's perceived adversaries.\par \par \uc2 But her private communications with some of Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's campaign aides, stolen from campaign chairman \uc2 John D. Podesta\uc2  and published over the last month by the activist group \uc2 WikiLeaks\uc2 , have revealed another side. In a sphere encrusted with suck-ups, soothers, and self-puffery, Ms. Tanden has emerged as a loyal but insistent straight-talker and acute assessor of Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's stubbornness and weaknesses.\par \par \uc2 ''What the emails show is somebody who is passionately invested in \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  giving the best possible candid advice she can to advance her electoral prospects,'' said Howard Wolfson, a former \uc2 Clinton\uc2  aide and a close friend of Ms. Tanden's. He added, ''And giving it privately.''\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 Clinton\uc2  campaign declined to comment on the emails, instead saying that the hack was a product of the Russian government's meddling in the \uc2 election\uc2  to benefit \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , the Republican nominee.\par \par \uc2 But as dozens of her stolen messages have gone public, Ms. Tanden's private and profanity-laced commentary has made her something of a cult hero for an unlikely group: \uc2 Trump\uc2  supporters. On a Reddit page called ''The_Donald,'' where \uc2 Trump\uc2  backers dissect the hacked email releases and post their findings, Ms. Tanden has garnered a slew of unwanted praise. One \uc2 Trump\uc2  fan called for a Neera Tanden fan club. Another dubbed her ''NoFilterNeera.''\par \par \uc2 Most of the stolen emails were exchanges between her and Mr. Podesta, her former boss at the \uc2 Center for American Progress\uc2 , a liberal think tank that Ms. Tanden now leads. Mr. Podesta is a longtime friend, and Ms. Tanden's tone is often that of a colleague grousing in the break room.\par \par \uc2 In the exchanges, Ms. Tanden can be fiercely protective of Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 . When Jennifer Palmieri, communications director of the \uc2 Clinton\uc2  campaign, wrote a sharply worded letter raising concerns about coverage of Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  in The \uc2 New York Times\uc2 , Ms. Tanden cheered. The letter ''is great,'' she wrote to Mr. Podesta -- adding a sentence laced with profanities directed at the newspaper.\par \par \uc2 But she could also be direct about other members of Clintonworld and the candidate herself.\par \par \uc2 When news media reports began identifying potential members of Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's campaign team last year, Ms. Tanden warned of griping among Democrats about racial and gender balance among Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's staff picks. ''I'm not the diversity police but there is grumbling on the 4 white boys running next presidential cycle,'' she wrote in January 2015. ''So I recommend rolling out some people who look like the rest of America soon!''\par \par \uc2 In May 2015, New York City's mayor, \uc2 Bill de Blasio\uc2 , emailed Ms. Tanden and Mr. Podesta to let them know that he was scheduled to appear on the MSNBC show ''Morning Joe'' and would likely offer his opinion of Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's policy vision.\par \par \uc2 ''I find him a bit insufferable,'' Ms. Tanden wrote to Mr. Podesta. (The mayor was frozen out over the ensuing months and denied a prime speaking slot at the Democratic convention this summer.)\par \par \uc2 Ms. Tanden's internal critiques may have damaged her relationships with other members of the concentric \uc2 Clinton\uc2  circles, and in the immutable fashion of Washington, she seems more likely to be punished than rewarded for her honesty. Asked about the \uc2 WikiLeaks\uc2  releases, Ms. Tanden said in an email that while she would not authenticate any of the messages, their leaking had been ''a profoundly painful experience.''\par \par \uc2 ''Having been a bit beaten up in the media over the last month myself, I have even greater appreciation for someone who has weathered it for 20 years,'' Ms. Tanden said of Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , calling her a ''role model.'' She added, ''My personal efforts have been to help her be successful.''\par \par \uc2 Philip J. Crowley, a former \uc2 Clinton\uc2  aide at the State Department who resigned in 2011 after publicly criticizing the Department of Defense for its treatment of a soldier accused of classified leaks, said he believed Ms. Tanden would still be welcome in Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's inner sanctum.\par \par \uc2 ''Will there have to be some conversations and a couple of beers and a mea culpa afterwards?'' Mr. Crowley said. ''Sure there will. But those who are experienced in the ways of Washington know how to work this.''\par \par \uc2 Some of Ms. Tanden's sharpest internal criticisms concerned Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's private email account, which prompted a federal investigation that is plaguing Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  anew. On Friday, the \uc2 Federal Bureau of Investigation\uc2  said it had uncovered a new trove of emails after seizing an electronic device shared by Anthony D. Weiner and his estranged wife, Huma Abedin, a top aide to Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 When Ms. Tanden first saw news reports about the private account in March 2015, she exchanged a series of emails with Mr. Podesta bemoaning how they had gotten into such a situation in the first place. She singled out other aides, including \uc2 Cheryl D. Mills\uc2 , a longtime senior adviser, for not recognizing the danger sooner.\par \par \uc2 ''This is a cheryl special,'' Ms. Tanden wrote. ''Know you love her, but this stuff is like her Achilles heel. Or kryptonite. she just can't say no.''\par \par \uc2 As the controversy wore on, Ms. Tanden griped about the White House ''crapping'' on Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , and insisted that Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  ought to make a public statement right away. She noted that Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , after years of enduring attacks and scandals she regarded as trumped-up, had a tendency to be stubborn about acknowledging error.\par \par \uc2 ''She always sees herself bending to their will when she hands over information, etc.,'' she wrote in August 2015. ''But the way she has to bend here is in the remorse. Not the 'if I had to do it all over again, I wouldn't do it.' A real feeling of -- this decision I made created a mess and I'm sorry I did that.''\par \par \uc2 In early September, Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  gave a series of interviews in which she apologized for the email issue. Mrs. Tanden joked that after one of the interviews, she ''was able to breathe again.''\par \par \uc2 Ms. Tanden was alert to the potential threat posed by Mr. Sanders's outsider campaign. She cautioned Mr. Podesta that aggressively going after Mr. Sanders could backfire.\par \par \uc2 ''Just game out what that does to Hillary,'' she wrote in August 2015. ''When we went after Obama, she got killed for it. Reaffirmed all her negatives, strengthened him. We had no idea it was kryptonite for us to do that, but it was.''\par \par \uc2 If Ms. Tanden seemed particularly on guard, perhaps it was because she knew what a failed \uc2 Clinton\uc2  campaign looked like -- and how painful it could be.\par \par \uc2 During Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's 2008 presidential run, Ms. Tanden wrote to Mr. Podesta about her malaise as it ended.\par \par \uc2 ''I am really profoundly sad today. I thought I was over it,'' she wrote. ''But here I am sad. She's not conceding tonight. ... And not anytime soon, either.''\par \par \uc2 Neera Tanden, president of the Center for American Progress, is well known for her peppery defenses of Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 .

\par\par \uc2 ON THE GROUND\par \uc2 National Desk; SECTA\par \b \uc2 Two Candidates Vie for One House Seat (for the Fourth Time)\b0\par\par\uc2 By JESS BIDGOOD \par \uc2 736 \uc2 words\par \uc2 30 October 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 18\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 In 2014, I wrote an article about New Hampshire's very swingy congressional districts. With the same Democrat and Republican facing off in the First District for the fourth -- yes, fourth -- time, I couldn't resist another visit.\par \par \uc2 Presidential candidate after presidential candidate visits this city, the biggest in New Hampshire. In late January or early February, its strip malls and no-nonsense main drag can feel like the center of the political world, as the news media descends and the voters decide whom they will rocket to the center of the presidential race with their first-in-the-nation primary.\par \par \uc2 It has also become part of a more predictable biennial battle: The tug of war between Representative Frank C. Guinta, a Republican, and former Representative Carol Shea-Porter, a Democrat, over the congressional seat that one of them has held for a decade.\par \par \uc2 Watching them debate is ''like seeing an old married couple rehash the same argument year after year after year,'' said Andy Smith, the director of the Survey Center at the University of New Hampshire. No one wants to see that anymore, he said.\par \par \uc2 The extended nature of this particular matchup is due in large part to the dynamics of the district -- and to the tenacity of two party outsiders who see, in alternating elections, a path to victory. New Hampshire's First District is one of a shrinking number of swing districts, with a large number of independent voters and perhaps a slightly Republican tilt. Ms. Shea-Porter, first elected when she was a little-known social worker, has done better during presidential \uc2 election\uc2  years, and Mr. Guinta in midterm elections. It is hard to keep the seat -- but also hard to suffer a resounding defeat.\par \par \uc2 Ms. Shea-Porter first won the seat, which had previously been controlled by Republicans for decades, in 2006, amid a swell of antiwar sentiment that helped Democrats around the country. She held on to it in 2008, when President Obama was elected, but lost it to Mr. Guinta, a former mayor of Manchester, in the Tea Party wave of 2010. Ms. Shea-Porter recaptured it as Mr. Obama won re-\uc2 election\uc2  in 2012, but lost it, again to Mr. Guinta, in 2014. This time around, polling shows Ms. Shea-Porter with a clear advantage. A WMUR Granite State poll released this month showed her with 43 percent support among likely voters, and Mr. Guinta with 29 percent.\par \par \uc2 Voters are ''probably sick and tired of these two candidates running against each other,'' said \uc2 David Wasserman\uc2 , the House editor of The Cook Political Report. ''The race essentially becomes a function of turnout as a result.''\par \par \uc2 Both candidates have overcome skepticism within their parties to return to the fray this year. Some of New Hampshire's top Republicans, including Senator Kelly Ayotte, suggested last year that Mr. Guinta should resign after he settled a campaign finance violation, but he slipped through the primary after embracing \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2 . Hacked emails from the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee reviewed by The Portsmouth Herald showed party leaders trying to encourage someone to challenge Ms. Shea-Porter in a primary, but he did not enter the race.\par \par \uc2 ''These two, in particular, are so stubborn,'' Mr. Wasserman said, ''that I'll be surprised when they stop running against each other.''\par \par \uc2 For the candidates, it is like seeing disliked neighbors emerge from their house once every two years, and wishing that they would just move away.\par \par \uc2 ''I wish I weren't running against the same person, but he did win his primary, so here we go again,'' Ms. Shea-Porter said.\par \par \uc2 Said Mr. Guinta, ''She does tend to talk about almost identical issues that she's campaigned on in previous campaigns.''\par \par \uc2 There are also third-party candidates, including Shawn O'Connor, who is running as an independent. He, along with Mr. Guinta and Ms. Shea-Porter, spoke at a congressional forum here this month.\par \par \uc2 ''That was kind of nice to hear someone else for a change,'' said Christine Williams, a college admissions director and a Republican.\par \par \uc2 Follow Jess Bidgood @jessbidgood on \uc2 Twitter\uc2 .

\par\par \uc2 OP-ED CONTRIBUTOR\par \uc2 Sunday Review Desk; SECTSR\par \b \uc2 Emails With a \uc2 Trump\uc2  Supporter\b0\par\par\uc2 By PETER ORNER \par \uc2 1,186 \uc2 words\par \uc2 30 October 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 9\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 San Francisco -- I have an old friend. If I need something, he's the guy I call. A good father, a good husband. He's got a Ph.D. and is a well-respected college professor. That I also believe he's a racist, misogynist, homophobic lunatic, I'll get to in a moment, because I first want to make very clear that I love him like a brother.\par \par \uc2 In high school my friend and I ran track together and because I was slow, he'd wait up for me, jogging in place at the top of each hill. And on those long runs we'd talk about philosophy and our own ''puny existences.'' That's the sort of guys we were. Lucky to have each other because our teammates thought we were freaks.\par \par \uc2 Today we live far apart, and mostly communicate by email. Lately I spend much of life, when I should be working or paying attention to my daughter, sending my friend screeds. And when I'm not writing them on the screen, I'm writing them in my head. I am -- and I'm not proud of this -- completely obsessed with my friend's position in this \uc2 election\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 My friend is an evangelical Christian and is, reluctantly, even now, supporting Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2 . He believes that Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  represents the lesser of two evils. He recently sent me an article from The Wall Street Journal arguing that Christians must do their duty and commit themselves to the difficult task of voting for Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  in the spirit of Dietrich Bonhoeffer who, accused of having supported the bomb plot to kill Hitler, was executed by the Nazis. Because sometimes the greater good requires, etc., etc., etc.\par \par \uc2 My unhinged response read, in part: ''Bonhoeffer's courage is the same COURAGE as voting for \uc2 Trump\uc2 ??? I expected more from you, a lot more. The only saving grace is that millions of Christians aren't buying it. I'll pray for you, my friend. And one day when you have to explain to your kids how you, as a Christian, but more important as a human being, could have supported this ticket, I'll tell them that you truly believed you were helping save the country from a monster enabler of sexual predators and rapists of 12-year-olds -- you had no choice. The all-white echo chamber where you received your information had so distorted your ability to see that you were temporarily blinded from reason.''\par \par \uc2 My friend responded, as he always does, mildly, asking me to please watch my language. Can't we discuss these issues without resorting to vitriol?\par \par \uc2 ''I love how this \uc2 election\uc2  has turned you into a moralist,'' he wrote. ''You're like an even more miniature Tim Kaine. My son (who was reading over my shoulder) asked me to tell you to 'give \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  credit for being a human being.' Once again, instead of seriously engaging with the issues at hand, you sling out insults. It's a very cogent article, one you are free to disagree with. But this isn't engagement. You are not addressing the very legitimate concerns about Hillary. That is problematic. Happy birthday by the way.''\par \par \uc2 As furious as I get, deep down, I don't actually doubt his sincerity when he tells me, mildly, always mildly, about \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's ''atrocities.''\par \par \uc2 Thinking about my friend makes me also think of my father. If my friend is the definition of a reluctant \uc2 Trump\uc2  supporter, my father, had he lived to enjoy this carnival, would have been the candidate's poster child.\par \par \uc2 I have it on good authority (my mother) that my father wept for hours on the night Bobby Kennedy was killed in 1968. In the '70s and early '80s, he was an active member of the finance council of the \uc2 Democratic National Committee\uc2 . But by the '90s he had come to embrace a shouting Fox News worldview of anti-immigrant and misogynist fervor, and he railed against what he called my hopeless political correctness.\par \par \uc2 The story of my father's conversion is complicated, but if there was one event that led to his nursing his grievances, it is that in the early 1990s, he was sued for sexual harassment by one of his former employees. Though the case was settled out of court and my father was never in jeopardy of losing his law license, he stepped down from something called the Character and Fitness Committee of the \uc2 Illinois State Bar Association\uc2 . You might laugh at this, but it's a real thing, and my father was especially proud of his service on this committee that measures a would-be lawyer's moral fiber.\par \par \uc2 He felt misunderstood, maligned. Did he do it? He always said the allegations were patently untrue, but few people believed him.\par \par \uc2 By the time of the Obama administration, he had begun referring to the president with a Yiddish term I won't repeat here (not, Dad, out of political correctness, but because it revolts me to this day and I can still hear you saying it in my ears). What he often had to say about women, especially my mother, who had left him, I won't include here, either. But when I heard the Access Hollywood tape of Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , I called my brother and asked him who the guy on the tape sounded like.\par \par \uc2 ''You gotta ask?''\par \par \uc2 But he was my father; I loved him. When he died a few years ago, I happened to be staying with my old friend when I received the news. That weekend we ran together and talked. ''Didn't he teach you how to play chess?'' my friend asked. ''Who introduced you to Dickens?''\par \par \uc2 He helped me remember that, behind the anger, my father was still, and always, my father. I can't expunge him from the record, my record. And to be honest it now brings me a warped kind of joy to think of what a kick he'd have gotten out of this last (ineffectual) roar of men of a certain age.\par \par \uc2 In 2014 my friend's father died as well. We commiserated over email, about however much you think you're ready for it, nothing prepares you for the void fathers leave behind.\par \par \uc2 In a bit I will send a message to my friend to say he's a revolting Neanderthal, that I'm not kidding, that I believe he's a danger to himself, his students, the Republic itself. I'll also say hey to Diane and the boys. That new school working out?\par \par \uc2 How comforting our most deeply held political convictions are, in contrast to our love, which, though inexplicable, is somehow always -- to use one my friend's favorite words -- merciful.\par \par \uc2 Follow The \uc2 New York Times\uc2  Opinion section on \uc2 Facebook\uc2  and \uc2 Twitter\uc2  (@NYTOpinion) , and sign up for the Opinion Today newsletter .\par \par \uc2 Peter Orner (@Peter_Orner) is the author of the forthcoming memoir ''Am I Alone Here?''\par \par \uc2 DRAWING (DRAWING BY KIERSTEN ESSENPREIS) \par \par \uc2 Document NYTF000020161030ecau0008x\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

Disappointing Ones.\b0\par\par\uc2 By KATHRYN SHATTUCK \par \uc2 774 \uc2 words\par \uc2 30 October 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 9\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Nearly a quarter-century into his career as a late-night host, \uc2 Conan O'Brien\uc2  isn't about to set his cruise control and coast. ''In some ways, I'm much more active than I was 10 years ago,'' the 53-year-old Mr. O'Brien said. ''I'm very fortunate that I can still be discovering things and feeling like a kid again.''\par \par \uc2 His latest gig: an executive producer of ''People of Earth,'' debuting at 9 p.m. on Monday, Oct. 31, on \uc2 TBS\uc2  and starring Wyatt Cenac, formerly of ''The Daily Show,'' as a New York reporter who checks out an upstate support group for alien abductees -- only to discover that he may be one himself. That same night, at 11, Mr. O'Brien will bring ''Conan'' and guests including Louis C. K., Ryan Reynolds and Tracy Morgan to the Apollo Theater in Harlem for four episodes. And at 10 p.m. on Dec. 7, he'll explore Berlin subcultures with help from a dominatrix in his latest travel special.\par \par \uc2 In a phone interview from Northern California, where he was vacationing with his wife, Liza Powel O'Brien, the cheeky Mr. O'Brien mused about extraterrestrial life and why he doesn't mind being the butt of a joke. These are edited excerpts from the conversation.\par \par \uc2 So you're on a romantic getaway.\par \par \uc2 Yeah, we have a 13-year-old daughter and a boy who's going to be 11 in a couple of weeks, and this is the first time that we've left them for more than two nights in a row. It's a huge milestone event, so let's make the story about that. It's going to get a lot of clicks, I'm telling you.\par \par \uc2 How did you come to ''People of Earth''?\par \par \uc2 I've had a production company, Conaco, for a number of years for projects that I really am passionate about -- kind of a TV equivalent of \uc2 Trump\uc2  University. It's a tax dodge, and we're really bilking the public. A lot of times we read a script, and it feels like homework. But this was an absolute delight. The other key piece of the puzzle, aside from \uc2 TBS\uc2 , was Greg Daniels [an executive producer of ''The Office''], who has a genius for very subtle comedy that's based on personality.\par \par \uc2 Do you believe in aliens?\par \par \uc2 I do think alien life exists. But I think when we do encounter life on other planets it's going to be extremely disappointing. I just don't think it's going to be the spaceship and these creatures with giant heads and huge eyes. It's going to be some sort of three-celled organism that grows on a rock and is really into pornography.\par \par \uc2 What's it like to work with Wyatt Cenac?\par \par \uc2 He's brilliant, and has incredible integrity. A fantastic added delight is getting to know Wyatt, who I'd admired from afar, and I mean that in a creepy way.\par \par \uc2 Why ''Conan'' at the Apollo?\par \par \uc2 This is a bucket-list thing. Just stepping up on that stage and walking around, a chill goes up your spine. I was there a week ago, shooting pieces in Harlem and going on adventures. When 30 women pull you into their salon and say, ''We're going to weave your hair,'' you say yes.\par \par \uc2 Is there anything left in this presidential campaign to mine for humor?\par \par \uc2 There's been a lot of good comedy about \uc2 Trump\uc2 , but he also presents a real challenge. He's a very hard person to satirize, because he's so outrageous to begin with. Myself, I'm eager for this \uc2 election\uc2  to be over. It got to a certain point where sadness started to creep in.\par \par \uc2 After travel specials in Cuba and South Korea, you're going to Berlin.\par \par \uc2 I've always loved being a fish out of water and having the locals laugh at me. I play in an avant-garde club with a band that's in crazy makeup and dresses. Probably my favorite part is when we went to Tempelhof Airport, where refugees are living until they can be given more permanent residence. It's almost comedy as diplomacy.\par \par \uc2 I'll let you get back to your wife now.\par \par \uc2 Please -- she grows weary of me very quickly. You're probably going to get a bunch of flowers that say, ''Thank you for taking care of my husband for half an hour so I can go and enjoy myself.''\par \par \uc2 CONAN O'BRIEN (PHOTOGRAPH BY TBS) \par \par \uc2 Document NYTF000020161030ecau000a2\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 OPINION\par \uc2 Sunday Review Desk; SECTSR\par \b \uc2 I Registered to Vote...for This?\b0\par\par\uc2 By EMMA ROLLER \par \uc2 1,777 \uc2 words\par \uc2 30 October 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 6\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Earlier this month, the United States hit a new benchmark in an already historic presidential campaign: For the first time in the country's history, 200 million Americans are registered to vote. Over the past eight years, more than 50 million people have registered. That could mean that more Americans are voting for the first time this year than ever before.\par \par \uc2 Your first time voting -- waiting in line, taking a possibly illegal selfie with your ballot, getting an ''I Voted'' sticker -- is as American a fall pastime as watching grown men run at each other headfirst for hours at a time. And voting is habit-forming: Research shows that your first \uc2 election\uc2  can have a strong impact on how you think about politics for the rest of your life.\par \par \uc2 This has been a weird \uc2 election\uc2  for everyone, but especially for people who are voting for the first time. In conversations I had with more than 50 first-time voters, the same word came up again and again when I asked what they thought about their options this year: ''Disappointing.'' While a large share of voters I talked to said they would be voting for \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , many saw their vote as more of a bulwark against a President \uc2 Trump\uc2  than anything else.\par \par \uc2 One of the most striking stories to come out of this \uc2 election\uc2  may be the number of immigrants \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2  inspired to earn their United States citizenship so they could vote against him. Idania Barousse, 36, is a pastoral associate at a Catholic church in San Jose, Calif., that serves a congregation of Hispanic immigrants. She immigrated to the United States from Nicaragua when she was 14 and obtained her green card shortly after. Despite living in the United States for more than two decades, she has never voted.\par \par \uc2 ''I feel like I wasted 20 years plus, and now I feel like my eyes opened up,'' she said.\par \par \uc2 In July, Ms. Barousse started the process of becoming a United States citizen and officially became one in September. She said she would be voting for Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 ''My spiritual life is connected to my neighbor, and I have to act by my actions,'' she told me. ''I cannot just cross my arms and pretend nothing's happening. I have to defend my neighbor.''\par \par \uc2 Anya Mironets, 31, is a clinical pharmacist in Fort Collins, Colo. She became a United States citizen after emigrating from Ukraine more than 10 years ago, but hasn't exercised her right to vote. Ms. Mironets said she worried that if Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  became president, the United States would start to resemble the former Soviet Union, where she grew up.\par \par \uc2 ''My mother, brother and other relatives still live in Ukraine. I worry about their safety every day, and \uc2 Trump\uc2 's praise of Putin and ignorance about Ukraine frightens me,'' she wrote in an email.\par \par \uc2 She added that she regretted not voting sooner, but said that when she was growing up overseas few people bothered to vote because rampant corruption made it unclear whether your vote would be counted.\par \par \uc2 ''It took me a decade of living in the United States to leave that mind-set behind,'' she said.\par \par \uc2 Abhi Singh, a 39-year-old filmmaker in San Francisco, became a citizen in 2015 and will be voting for Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 . Despite his reservations about Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's foreign policy and her private email server, he sees voting against Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  as a civic duty this year.\par \par \uc2 ''To say that you are not voting because you are disappointed with the candidates is an arrogant display of privilege,'' he said. ''I've seen grandmas in India wait in line for hours to cast their vote, and I can safely tell you that the candidates and prospects were not any better than what we are faced with today.''\par \par \uc2 Paola Anez-Kikendall, a 47-year-old mother of three in North Carolina, moved to the United States from Venezuela as a child, but ''felt an urgency'' to become a citizen only this year. She identifies as a Republican, but said she could not stomach the party's nominee.\par \par \uc2 ''As a woman, as a Hispanic woman, as a mother of a grown child who happens to also be gay,'' she said, ''I just cannot do it.'' She voted early for \uc2 Gary Johnson\uc2 , the Libertarian Party candidate.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's candidacy has politically mobilized the Hispanic community in ways that no other modern candidate appears to have done. This fall, Enrico Trevisani, 19, a junior at the \uc2 University of Arizona\uc2 , started a chapter of Voto Latino on campus to register fellow Hispanic voters. He recalled registering an older woman to vote at a taco stand in Tucson -- a symbolic location, he said, since a \uc2 Trump\uc2  supporter had warned of ''taco trucks on every corner.''\par \par \uc2 ''You could tell there was something different about this \uc2 election\uc2  to her,'' Mr. Trevisani said, referring to the woman. ''You could tell it was personal.''\par \par \uc2 The young Muslim voters I talked to have also taken Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's candidacy personally. Aisha Bhoori is a junior at Harvard, and while she feels safe on campus, she worries about her parents when they attend Friday Prayer at their mosque in New Jersey.\par \par \uc2 ''If \uc2 Trump\uc2  wins, it's not a stretch to say that my entire religion will be under attack and Islamophobic incidents will increase,'' she said.\par \par \uc2 Ms. Bhoori supported Senator Bernie Sanders in the Democratic primary and said she has come to accept Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  ''with the same measured enthusiasm that I do 'Hamilton,' the musical: She has her flaws, and I don't wholeheartedly agree with all of her policies, but she's cracked the glass ceiling, goddamn it, and done so in a competent and confident and composed way that makes me proud.''\par \par \uc2 Imani Khan, a freshman at \uc2 St. Louis University\uc2 , said she hoped American Muslims like herself would exercise their right to vote. Many see voting as a morally impure act, she said, especially if the politician they elect ends up contributing to more Muslim suffering overseas.\par \par \uc2 ''It's about time we start joining a conversation that includes us,'' she said.\par \par \uc2 Ms. Khan plans to vote for Jill Stein, the Green Party candidate. Her reasoning: Missouri is not a swing state, and if the Green Party wins 5 percent of the popular vote this year, it will qualify for federal \uc2 election\uc2  funding in 2020.\par \par \uc2 ''Two parties do not cover the wide spectrum of Americans' political views,'' she said. ''Other countries have three, four, five, six parties. Why are we still stuck at two?''\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  and his supporters often say they represent the silent majority -- voters forgotten by the American political elite who aren't telling pollsters they support Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , but will turn out in droves. That idea has not held up under scrutiny. (Instead of the silent majority, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's supporters might be called the ''vocal plurality.'')\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's supporters don't see their vote as a vote for a hateful agenda; quite the opposite. Tyler Rice, 20, a plumber in Kentucky, said he was ''extremely excited'' to cast his first ballot for Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 ''He is representing a class of people who have been long forgotten by the federal government,'' he wrote in an email. ''Soaked in dirty politics and pay to play scenarios. I'm voting for \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  because he will strengthen America back into what she has always been, The Best.''\par \par \uc2 Other young Republicans are more reticent in their support for Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 . Charlie Kolean, a senior at \uc2 Michigan State University\uc2 , said Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  had ''obvious flaws,'' but ''understands what drives the economy and will do what it takes to get the economy going.''\par \par \uc2 Laura Schmitt, a junior at the University of Wisconsin, identifies as a conservative but will be voting for Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 ''I wish I were more optimistic about this \uc2 election\uc2  like lots of young people were when Obama took office,'' she said. ''I am unable to support \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  because he does not represent my values or what I believe the Republican Party truly represents.''\par \par \uc2 That excitement gap is something Edgeri Hudlin, a senior at \uc2 Duke University\uc2 , tried to close. He worked with \uc2 Rock the Vote\uc2  on a rap video to encourage millennials to vote. ''Even through the apathy, we have to understand that our vote -- even if you think it doesn't make a big change -- it does something.'' he said.\par \par \uc2 Young female voters, especially young white ones, said their reaction to the prospect of the first female president surprised even them. Kiley Delaney, a junior at Macalester College in Minnesota, said she was excited to cast her first vote for Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 . When Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  accepted the Democratic nomination in July, Ms. Delaney -- to her own surprise -- started crying.\par \par \uc2 ''I know it's not cool to be excited to vote for Hillary, and that we're supposed to preface every positive remark about her with, 'Well, she's certainly not perfect, but ...,' but I would be excited to vote for her even if \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  wasn't her opponent,'' she said. ''I hope that I will cry again at her inauguration.''\par \par \uc2 Ellie Herman, a junior at the University of Wisconsin, persuaded her 87-year-old grandmother -- a staunch Republican who despises the Clintons -- to mail in her ballot for Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 ''The more I time I spend with my grandma, the more I think my liberal vibes are rubbing off on her,'' Ms. Herman said. ''Thankfully, her hatred of \uc2 Trump\uc2  and availability to vote from home were enough reasons for her to vote for Hillary.''\par \par \uc2 American voters -- students, teachers, farmers, nurses, hedge fund managers, mechanics, bus drivers, government pencil pushers, working moms, stay-at-home dads, tech titans and the baristas that serve them -- all have a chance to make their voices heard on Nov. 8. Many have already exercised their voice in the political process. I am thinking of the heavily tattooed man in Cleveland who prayed over me for my safety at the Republican National Convention, or the young man at a \uc2 Trump\uc2  rally in Harrisburg, Pa. who gave me the finger, unprovoked.\par \par \uc2 Now there's just one more thing for them to do.\par \par \uc2 Follow The \uc2 New York Times\uc2  Opinion section on \uc2 Facebook\uc2  and \uc2 Twitter\uc2  (@NYTopinion), and sign up for the Opinion Today newsletter.\par \par \uc2 Emma Roller (@EmmaRoller), a former reporter for National Journal, is a contributing opinion writer.\par \par \uc2 DRAWINGS: Idania Barousse; Abhi Singh; Laura Schmitt; Enrico Trevisani, on registering a Latino voter.; Tyler Rice, on Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 .

\par\par \uc2 Style Desk; SECTST\par \b \uc2 How \uc2 Trump\uc2  and Pepe the Frog Joined Forces\b0\par\par\uc2 By ALEX WILLIAMS \par \uc2 1,168 \uc2 words\par \uc2 30 October 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 10\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Pepe the Frog, Nasty Woman, #NeverTrump.\par \par \uc2 Internet memes, the viral in-jokes of online culture, have emerged as a potent force in the presidential race, serving to build up and tear down candidates.\par \par \uc2 Brad Kim, the editor of Know Your Meme, a website that dissects the viral phenomenon, has been tracking each political season since 2008, when he was a student at \uc2 New York University\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 He spoke from his office in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, about how memes have become a dog whistle of this \uc2 election\uc2  cycle, and their impact on \uc2 Election\uc2  Day.\par \par \uc2 Q. When did memes become a force in American politics?\par \par \uc2 A. The 2008 \uc2 election\uc2  was the light-bulb moment. Campaigns were trying to reach out to younger voters on emergent social media platforms like \uc2 YouTube\uc2  and \uc2 Facebook\uc2 . Shepard Fairey's ''Hope'' poster went viral, inspired countless parodies and was an early breakthrough that shed a light on social media's potential for crowdsourced campaigning.\par \par \uc2 There were also so-called ''single serving'' sites like Barack Obama Is Your New Bicycle, which really blew up. That was a very simply laid-out website that would display randomly generated non sequiturs that portrayed Barack Obama as your helpful next-door neighbor, like, ''Barack Obama warmed up your car for you,'' or ''Barack Obama left a message on your blog.''\par \par \uc2 The general message was: Barack Obama is good for you, he is in tune with the social media generation.\par \par \uc2 Were Republicans able to counter with memes of their own?\par \par \uc2 In 2008, memes were simply a P.R. nightmare for the Republican Party. Most of them were satires of \uc2 Sarah Palin\uc2 . She was one of the first major candidates to be perceived as a loose cannon and as a sound-bite generator that ultimately worked against the party.\par \par \uc2 A hashtag that really took off was #AccordingtoPalin, which was just a running joke about remarks that she had made that were very questionable, like, ''You can see Russia from Alaska.''\par \par \uc2 So surely the G.O.P. learned its lesson by 2012?\par \par \uc2 As far as memes go, 2012 was an even bigger nightmare for the Republicans. Obama had a comfortable lead for most of the way, and Occupy Wall Street was a grass-roots movement that really saturated social media and aligned sentiment against rich guys in general.\par \par \uc2 A lot of memes ended up portraying \uc2 Mitt Romney\uc2  as the Sith Lord of America. The ''binders full of women'' line from the town hall debate was a prime example. Within 24 hours, that gaffe turned into a full-blown meme, mostly in the form of captioned image parodies.\par \par \uc2 What's new this year?\par \par \uc2 From what we've observed so far, memes are no longer treated as nuisances, although they still can be. We've seen memes play a vital role in crafting a powerful cult of personalities for Bernie Sanders and Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Sanders seemed to come out of nowhere this year. Were memes a factor?\par \par \uc2 If I had to pick one thing that was the most unique this year, it was the idolization of Bernie Sanders through meme caricatures.\par \par \uc2 Two of the most popular ones were Barnie Sandlers and Bernie Sanders' Dank Meme Stash, two \uc2 Facebook\uc2  pages that operated on the same joke, that Bernie was running on a pro-meme platform. People would cut and paste text onto promotional materials, like official Sanders fliers, so it would seem as if Bernie was making insightful comments on the state of memes, as opposed to the state of politics.\par \par \uc2 Ultimately, they helped provide him an exceptionally large online following, in comparison with his actual delegate count.\par \par \uc2 What about with \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2 ?\par \par \uc2 This year, meme culture has outgrown its longstanding, left-leaning edge. Reddit, for example, has a sub-Reddit page called The_Donald, which is one of the fastest growing pro-\uc2 Trump\uc2  communities. There is also 4chan's /pol/-Politically Incorrect page.\par \par \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  himself has been a major factor. No other candidate in modern U.S. \uc2 election\uc2  history has had such an openly antagonistic relationship with the news media and a high level of disregard for Beltway conventions. Memes have been his way to take his message straight to the people.\par \par \uc2 Which brings us to Pepe the Frog. How did this cartoon frog take off?\par \par \uc2 Pepe is an internet symbol that has been around for years. He was a character in the comic ''Boy's Club'' by Matt Furie, and he used to be known as ''Feels Bad Man,'' because he looked so sad.\par \par \uc2 Feels Bad Man frog inspired many spinoffs over the years, but until 2015, he was a symbol of sad-sack, beta-male singledom for users of 4chan. That site is widely described as the ''cesspool'' of the internet. It is basically a locker room full of a bunch of single dudes commiserating over their social awkwardness.\par \par \uc2 So how did Pepe become a \uc2 Trump\uc2  symbol?\par \par \uc2 Pepe didn't become political until \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  endorsed it by retweeting a \uc2 Trump\uc2  version of the character, which led to a mass influx of pro-\uc2 Trump\uc2  Pepes.\par \par \uc2 You have to consider social media's political climate leading up to 2016, which has been heavily marked by the gender war and identity politics. These things led to the emergence of a reactionary movement, namely the alt-right, and \uc2 Trump\uc2  was kind of the natural poster boy for that.\par \par \uc2 Pepe plugged into the ideology of the alt-right because it was a reaction against the people they call ''normies.'' Pepe had been a symbol of the disenfranchised, social outcasts. It was \uc2 Trump\uc2 's natural audience.\par \par \uc2 Pretty soon there was a huge influx of racist Pepe memes from 4chan and The_Donald community on Reddit. But the real trigger point that led to mass production of Nazi and other offensive Pepes was after \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  released a denouncement of the meme, which is a milestone in meme history.\par \par \uc2 No meme has ever been denounced by a presidential candidate. In a way, Pepe serves as a social media dog whistle for \uc2 Trump\uc2  followers to echo their implicit support of ultraconservative beliefs in public forums without risking the invitation of backlash.\par \par \uc2 Is there a meme shared by supporters of both major party candidates?\par \par \uc2 One that has been used by both sides is ''This Is Fine'' dog. It's a web comic by K. C. Green, of a dog sitting in a room engulfed in flames, but he says, ''This is fine.''\par \par \uc2 This is how many American voters feel about the state of affairs in this year's \uc2 election\uc2 . They think the world is ending.\par \par \uc2 Continue following our fashion and lifestyle coverage on \uc2 Facebook\uc2  (Styles and Modern Love), \uc2 Twitter\uc2  (Styles, Fashion and Weddings) and \uc2 Instagram\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 This interview has been edited and condensed.\par \par \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2  endorsed Pepe the Frog via Twitter. The ''Nasty Woman'' meme took off after Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's remark to Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 .

\par\par \uc2 THE CULTURE ISSUE\par \uc2 Magazine Desk; SECTMM\par \b \uc2 It All Connects\b0\par\par\uc2 By JONATHAN LETHEM \par \uc2 6,262 \uc2 words\par \uc2 30 October 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 60\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 If the first paragraph of this article were the start of an Adam Curtis film, it would begin with a flat, declarative statement. Something like: ''This is a film about a curious afternoon in the summer of 2016, when an American novelist pretending to be a journalist went to meet a British journalist who wanted nothing to do with being called an artist.''\par \par \uc2 The British journalist's name is Adam Curtis. Now 61, Curtis has written or directed more than a dozen hypnotically watchable, hilarious and ominous films, all of which explore nothing less than the cultural and political subconscious of the last half of the 20th-century and the first decades of the 21st. I'd been obsessed with Curtis's work for years; to meet him felt like a privilege. I was in a mighty fine mood too, having finished both a novel and a semester of teaching just days before. I was informed, by the friends who offered me a room in their Camden Town flat, that the London weather was good. Not good, great. Never mind that the world was in tatters and \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  was smirking unstoppably toward Republican coronation. When Curtis suggested I meet him in the famous lobby of the \uc2 BBC\uc2 , I borrowed my host's London map and tackled the crazy-quilt streets. My two-mile walk was exultant. A person who for years had been only an odd, welcome intruder in my brain was about to take me to lunch.\par \par \uc2 Outwardly, Curtis's films are journalistic expos\u233\'00\'E9s in a documentary mode. They often extend to three or four or even five one-hour episodes; more recently they've consisted of single continuous presentations lasting more than two hours. Curtis is not an underground presence, not in England. He is a longtime employee of the \uc2 BBC\uc2 , a.k.a. (sentimentally) ''the Beeb,'' a pillar of 20th- and 21st-century British self-understanding. The films take familiar subjects -- the Cold War, the growth of public relations or financial or military-industrial bureaucracies, the premises of the ecology or anti-psychiatry movements, the enmeshment of Western democracies in quasi-colonial military adventures in the Middle East -- and render them strange. Stories that might seem like ''social studies'' fodder become, in Curtis's hands, compulsive, like a giddy horror film you can't quit watching.\par \par \uc2 His method is one of serenely bizarre juxtaposition. He pursues the art of the wild leap, at the level of both ''form'' (the editing in his films, which consists of abrupt jumps between disparate sequences and images) and ''content'' (his factual assertions, the lines he traces among seemingly unrelated events and historical actors; the music, which veers between trance-inducing techno-beats or ambient indie pop of the Brian Eno persuasion and satirically iconic standards or show tunes; and his own narration, which drones on authoritatively except when suddenly giving way to aphoristic headlines that flash on-screen in the manner of a Barbara Kruger-style gallery installation, or vanishes in favor of undigested imagery and song). It is as if your history teacher had decided to show you the brainwashing films that Malcolm McDowell was forced to watch in ''A Clockwork Orange.'' Like McDowell's character, you at once resist and are seduced, and by the end your brain is both exhausted and enlarged, full of new things that don't all seem to fit together. Unlike McDowell's character, if you are me, you want more, and are willing to prop your own eyelids open to get it. Long before preparing to meet him, I'd been prone to spending too-long nights on Curtis binges on my laptop, resulting in Curtis hangovers the following day.\par \par \uc2 Now, I won't offer too much more of this rote, no-longer-very-New Journalism stuff -- I swear never to mention anything either Curtis or I ate or drank -- but it's crucial that I offer a behind-the-curtain glimpse here, because it exemplifies a difficulty native to Curtis's films. This difficulty could be called: Where Is This Voice Coming From? One of Curtis's central subjects, running through all his work, is the possibility that we're listening to the wrong voices in public life, and in our own heads; that the ideas we find authoritative and persuasive about our politics and culture are in fact a tenuous construction, one at the mercy of bias, invisible ideological sway and unprocessed, untethered emotions (principally, fear).\par \par \uc2 What this brings up, reasonably enough, is the problem of Adam Curtis's authority: Who is he to be telling me this? Probably this was already in the back of my head during my happy walk through Regent's Park. Had Curtis asked to meet in the lobby, rather than some modest cafe nearby, in order to underscore his platform at the \uc2 BBC\uc2 ? Or to play against it? Or was there perhaps no modest cafe nearby?\par \par \uc2 And, despite the humble cards I've played (weather, map, hangovers), let's not ignore my present platform. ''This is a film about a curious afternoon in the summer of 2016, when The \uc2 New York Times\uc2  came to make a polite visit to the \uc2 BBC\uc2 , in order to enclose one of England's most unusual journalists within its own sphere of influence.'' For some readers, these major-brand affiliations may be ennobling, and inspire confidence. For those more suspicious, the names of the mighty news organizations will be proof that deeper truth has, like Elvis, left the building.\par \par \uc2 Curtis prefers you to be suspicious, alert to bullying ideologies that whisper in the guise of neutral authority (like ''The Paper of Record''). And yet he wants you to believe him. Why shouldn't he? And so a Curtis account of our meeting would reveal, through his dry, airy, insinuating narration, what you're really seeing: not simply a jaunty middle-aged American stepping into a famous lobby to greet a boyish, alert, middle-aged Brit, but two media conglomerates in communion as well. The voice is essential. For, as Curtis would be the first to tell you, systems of power, influence and control are extremely difficult to depict on camera.\par \par \uc2 I arrived, in fact, as Curtis was laboring at edits on his new film, ''HyperNormalisation,'' a nearly three-hour epic pegged to several present crises: Brexit, European immigration, suicide bombing, the war in Syria. The sequence under Curtis's editorial hand today involved the financial firm \uc2 BlackRock\uc2 , which operates a powerful computerized risk-management network called Aladdin on the outskirts of an innocuous town in Washington State. Curtis's belief is that Aladdin, in guiding the investment of now more than $14 trillion of assets around the world, has become an enormous unacknowledged force for stasis in an innately dynamic world.\par \par \uc2 But how to show it? All he had to work with were a few archival talking-head clips, an Aladdin advertising reel, some footage he shot of the sheds housing Aladdin's server farms and his own narration. Curtis was frustrated. ''How do you illustrate something invisible?'' he asked, as if he'd never solved this problem before, or at least not to his satisfaction. ''It's not even people doing keystrokes on computers. It's just things roaring away. I'll show you this 37-second shot, my driving past those sheds.''\par \par \uc2 As we watched, Curtis told me about his admiration for the recent movie ''The Big Short,'' which tried to portray, for a popular audience, another facet of those invisible forces at work. ''This is the whole thing about 'good and evil' -- it's a na\u239\'00\'EFve view of the world. The problem is bigger, it's a system.'' Curtis and I briefly discussed a word coined by the critic Timothy Morton to describe a problem so vast in space and time that you are unable to apprehend it: a ''hyperobject.'' Global warming is a classic example of a hyperobject: it's everywhere and nowhere, too encompassing to think about. Global markets, too. But naming a hyperobject alone is of limited use; human cognition knows all too well how to file such imminent imponderables away, on a ''to-do'' list that's never consulted again.\par \par \uc2 ''I thought it was a brave stab at it,'' Curtis said, continuing his analysis of ''The Big Short.'' ''But my argument would be that even the financial system they're pointing to is only a component of something even bigger, that we haven't really put together. That bigger thing: It's my hyperobject.''\par \par \uc2 ''I want to be Adam Curtis when I grow up.'' These words were tweeted last year by the gadfly American documentarian Errol Morris, director of ''The Thin Blue Line'' and ''The Fog of War.'' Morris's tweet greeted the release of Curtis's film ''Bitter Lake,'' a two-and-a-quarter-hour historical fugue on the American, Russian and British interventions in Afghanistan. ''I'm embarrassed, because the amount of stuff I've learned from Adam Curtis is almost unending,'' Morris told me. ''There's really no one like him here. I think of Seymour Hersh, who's a different kind of animal altogether. There's this raw intelligence -- let's call Curtis sui generis. Had I ever heard of Qutb before I watched 'The Power of Nightmares'? Maybe you had -- I hadn't.''\par \par \uc2 Morris was talking about Sayyid Qutb, the Egyptian author, Muslim theologian and anti-Western propagandist, who is one of the twin poles -- the other being the Chicago-based conservative academic Leo Strauss -- around which Curtis wove his three-part 2004 series, ''The Power of Nightmares.'' Qutb, who was partly educated in the United States, became a leader of Egypt's \uc2 Muslim Brotherhood\uc2  and was executed in 1966 for plotting to overthrow the government of President Gamal Abdel Nasser. His intellectual lineage runs directly through Ayman al-Zawahri to Osama bin Laden. And no, I hadn't heard of him before Curtis's film either.\par \par \uc2 ''The Power of Nightmares,'' a study of the parallel growths of radical Islamist violence and the neoconservative movement that defined the U.S. response to 9/11, was the first Curtis film that Morris, or I, had seen. The film's thesis: that the present disaster was in some sense called forth by two oddly compatible apocalyptic responses to the anxieties raised by the fulfillments and disappointments of Western-style liberalism. Uncomfortable in 2004, the film's assertions still attract dispute even as the central thesis has trickled into the popular imagination such that many who have never seen Curtis's film now accept it as a given.\par \par \uc2 If Americans like Morris and myself have tended to learn of Curtis's work beginning with ''The Power of Nightmares,'' his British viewers usually started earlier, with his landmark treatises on the biases of technological utopian social thinking (''Pandora's Box,'' 1992); on propaganda, historical amnesia, brainwashing and nostalgia (''The Living Dead,'' 1995); on the growth of popular psychiatry and public relations, and the merging of the cult of personal fulfillment with consumerist imperatives (''The Century of the Self,'' 2002). ''The Century of the Self,'' in particular, is seen by many in Britain as Curtis's signature accomplishment. These early works construct a kind of ''bible'' of Curtis's thinking, upon which his later arguments build.\par \par \uc2 The British director Stephen Frears began with ''The Mayfair Set'' (1999), which depicts a group of entrepreneurs who, starting in the '60s, dismantled the power of the British state and helped usher the free market back into politics, with disastrous results. ''It's absolutely brilliant,'' Frears says. ''I was just watching television, and I couldn't believe what I was seeing. It was such a dazzling analysis. He's a cult figure in England, but he has access. The \uc2 BBC\uc2  is the greatest broadcasting organization in the world. In 'Bitter Lake,' he had all the material. He's standing in the right place, inside that archive.'' Even among those skeptical of Curtis's narratives, his masterly use of the \uc2 BBC\uc2  archive -- his uncanny capacity to excavate sequences from the dark side of journalism's moon and the expressive power he finds in their juxtaposition -- produces awe. Curtis possesses a ''dazzlingly acute eye,'' wrote Andrew Anthony in The Observer, even as he accused him of ''superimposing his own creative theory as journalistic fact.''\par \par \uc2 Curtis is justly proud of his adeptness in the archives: ''It's all stored in a giant warehouse on the outskirts of West London, deliberately kept anonymous. It's the biggest film archive in the world. The cataloging is good, although it's been done at different stages. But, because the \uc2 BBC\uc2  is an organization that has a vast global news output, I discovered that, throughout the 1980s, there were these giant two-inch videotapes, called COMP tapes, onto which satellites would just dump stuff overnight. And they're not well cataloged. You can go to a news item and see; if there was a COMP tape for that day, you can order it up. Those two-inch tapes start to degrade, but they've been transferred, and they're amazing.''\par \par \uc2 Pause.\par \par \uc2 ''Or no. Sometimes they're very boring. Sometimes they're like an hour of a chair waiting for someone to come to it. I don't do that Andy Warhol stuff of a chair for an hour. But then, someone will come to the chair and prepare, and you've got that moment. When one of those COMP tapes turns up for me because of something I've ordered, I just press fast forward and go through it all. Until something catches my eye, and then I will then digitize it. And I've got a very good memory. I have a pattern memory, an associative way of thinking.''\par \par \uc2 Pause.\par \par \uc2 ''If you really want to know, it's like a computer game, the archive. There are different levels. Most people can only get to Level 1. I can get to Level 6.''\par \par \uc2 Readers may recall a sequence from Michael Moore's ''Fahrenheit 9/11,'' in which Deputy Secretary of Defense Paul Wolfowitz was inadvertently caught licking his comb as he readied to go on camera. The moment was imperishable, and cruel. As it happens, Curtis has made it a recurring emblem of his work to show familiar figures of power -- \uc2 Tony Blair\uc2 , Ronald Reagan, Thatcher, Putin, many others -- in interstitial moments of a similar kind, often precisely when they have taken a chair in preparation for the red light to go on, and are either unaware they are already being recorded or too bored to care.\par \par \uc2 Curtis's brief against world leaders -- or at least the policies they're chosen to embody, at the cost of great misery -- is pretty savage. Neoliberals fare as poorly as neocons. He's got no love for tyrants either. But he doesn't opt, as Moore did with Wolfowitz, to expose his politicians as pathetic. The tiny portraits he carves from the archives are, instead, strangely tender. The human souls in question often appear introspective, as if measuring their self-possession, or discreetly consulting some inner oracle. \uc2 Bill \uc2 Clinton\uc2  coughs. \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  nods to herself, hesitates, smiles. Putin shrugs. Hafez al-Assad merely waits, thinking.\par \par \uc2 Curtis's films often have surprise bonus protagonists -- guest stars, in television terms. In ''HyperNormalisation,'' it is Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi who steals the show, thanks to a stream of uncanny archival appearances of this kind, including one in which he pours himself a healthy glass of milk from a pitcher. Curtis, by testimony of his narration, regards the sinister, flamboyant Qaddafi as the West's polymorphous dupe, less a monster than a man monstrously acted upon -- a fictional character in a story the West told itself to skirt harder truths. ''Violence born out of political struggles for power,'' Curtis said, ''became replaced by a much simpler image, of the head of a rogue state, who became more like an archcriminal who wanted to terrorize the world.''\par \par \uc2 With each new bit of footage, a glance, a shy smile, Qaddafi's human presence seeps unexpectedly into the viewer's sympathies. Reagan's does as well. Curtis's politicians, ultimately, contend with their own bafflement in the face of the unseen forces shaping their world. They're traveling with us, stuck inside the hyperobject.\par \par \uc2 Curtis grew up in Platt, North Kent, just outside Greater London. His father was a cinematographer who worked with the British documentarian Humphrey Jennings, with the ''Death Wish'' director Michael Winner and on ''The Buccaneers,'' a pirate-themed television program starring Robert Shaw. Curtis's family was left-wing. ''According to family talk,'' he said, his great-uncle was a committed Trotskyite. His socialist grandfather, meanwhile, ''would stand as a member of Parliament for seats he would never, ever win -- and he did it every \uc2 election\uc2 .''\par \par \uc2 Curtis earned a degree in the human sciences at Oxford, then briefly taught there. Unsatisfied with academia, he took a job at the \uc2 BBC\uc2 , eventually going to work in the early '80s as a segment producer on ''That's Life!'' a kind of cross between ''60 Minutes'' and ''Candid Camera.'' There, Curtis learned his craft. ''One week I was sent up to Edinburgh to film a singing dog,'' he said. ''His owner said that when he played the bagpipes, the dog would sing Scottish songs. We set the camera up. The owner dressed up in a kilt and started to play the bagpipes. The dog refused to sing. It just sat there looking at me just saying nothing. It just sat there, with a really smug look on its face. This went on for about two hours.'' Curtis phoned his producer. ''She said: 'Darling, that is wonderful. Don't you see that the dog refusing to sing for a man dressed up in a kilt is actually very funny? Go back and keep filming. Film the dog doing nothing. But film the man as well.' ''\par \par \uc2 ''So I did. We ran a long close-up shot of the dog's face with the sound of out-of-tune bagpipes. It was quite avant-garde, but the audience loved it, especially when you cut it against the face of the man puffing at the bagpipes who genuinely believed that the dog was about to sing.\par \par \uc2 ''That time with a dog taught me the fundamental basics of journalism. That what really happens is the key thing; you mustn't try and force the reality in front of you into a predictable story. What you should do is notice what is happening in front of your eyes, and what instinctively your reaction is. And my reaction was that I hated the dog as it looked at me silently. So I made a short film about that.''\par \par \uc2 Despite his Oxford education, a hint of a provincial resentment defines Curtis's attitudes toward London's cultural intelligentsia. Americans might model this as the ''John Lennon syndrome'' (as opposed to the sense of ease and entitlement exhibited by, say, Mick Jagger). ''The snooty people disagree with me,'' he said. ''The posh literary lot. They don't like me because they think I'm not elegant and literary and I don't make enough references. And what I do is I play fast and loose -- not with the facts, they're not interested in that -- but with my aesthetic responses. I put pop music, David Bowie, in the middle of an Afghan film. It's all a bit vulgar.''\par \par \uc2 Curtis foregrounds such tonal collisions, and he still delights in the comedy of dogs refusing to sing on cue, especially when the dogs in question are influential scientists, famous politicians or pontificating news presenters. He underlines the pratfalls and discontinuities of our neoliberal consensus not only with pop songs but also with an occasional boing! sound straight out of a cartoon soundtrack. Curtis isn't frightened, and he doesn't want to frighten you either. ''I try to do the very opposite,'' he said. He prefers using ''all sorts of devices and jokes and parodies of fear to undercut the fear, to try and pull the poison. Because people are overwhelmed.''\par \par \uc2 ''Movies are an authoritarian medium,'' wrote David Foster Wallace in 1996. ''They vulnerabilize you and then dominate you.'' Wallace's cautionary tone typifies humanistic reservations about the power of the moving image, in the hands of a spellbinder like Curtis (or, in Wallace's essay, David Lynch). ''Film's overwhelming power isn't news,'' Wallace continued. ''But different kinds of movies use this power in different ways. Art film is essentially teleological: it tries in various ways to 'wake the audience up' or render us more 'conscious.' ''\par \par \uc2 Curtis alludes to such aims only in the plainest terms. ''I use music and all the cultural references that I would talk to my friends about, so it feels like a program made by someone you know,'' he said. ''Also, what I do deliberately, is I show the joins. There's no reason you can't join any two pieces of film up. So I will often in the editing deliberately make a discordant edit. It just makes you aware of what it is you are watching.''\par \par \uc2 Curtis has as at least as much in common with installation artists like Kruger or Christian Marclay as he does with shoe-leather reporters like Hersh -- indeed, his most anomalous project, ''Everything Is Going According to Plan'' (2013), consisted of a site-specific film-concert hybrid at the Park Avenue Armory in Manhattan, in collaboration with the band Massive Attack. But Curtis defiantly resists being called an ''artist.'' ''If you're an artist, you tend to have that rather smug sense of, I'm doing this great work,'' he said. ''I don't have that at all. I go out and I find stories, and I find ways of doing them in an imaginative way. I'm a journalist, and I'm responding to my time. That's it.'' Forget Curtis's collaborations with rock musicians; never mind the cover ''it's art'' might offer him from critics complaining that he lacks footnotes and dabbles too much in allusion and mood; and never mind how every plumber is supposed to want to be a poet. Curtis wants no part of it.\par \par \uc2 His grudge against contemporary art can seem either a provocation or an eccentricity, until he places it in relation to a few of his key terms, like ''consumer capitalism'' and ''the self.'' ''The problem is that the central ideology of our age is the idea of self-expression,'' he said. ''That the self, being expressive, is the good thing. It's what I trace in 'The Century of the Self.' Expressing yourself through consumerism is central. So, the dilemma for artists is that however radical in content their paintings, their performance art, their video works, the mode in which they're doing it -- self-expression -- feeds the strength of the very thing they're trying to overthrow, which is modern consumer capitalism.''\par \par \uc2 Curtis prefers Balzac, the novelist of intricate social tapestries, to the modernist tradition of interiority defined by Woolf and Proust. But the novelist he claims as inspiration is Dos Passos, whose ''U.S.A.'' trilogy he read when he was a boy, and whose centrifugal blend of pastiche and documentation may be the key to Curtis's style. At the other end, Curtis's artistic nemesis is Andy Warhol. ''I've got this idea. I call it the I.A.R., the Inappropriate Aesthetic Response. I date it back to Warhol. It's this idea you can take horrific images like the electric chair and aestheticize them. The beheading videos, the orange jumpsuits against the desert background; ISIS uses that knowingly. I have a ruthless theory, that the radical-art movement, which grew out of the failure of revolutionary politics, becomes the outriders for the property developers. You need the aesthetic of decline in order to make those buildings desirable.''\par \par \uc2 ''HyperNormalisation'' is a summation of one of Curtis's major themes: that liberalism -- since the collapse of certainty about how its values would transform politics, finance and journalism -- has in fact become genuinely conservative. In a world of unpredictability, it has retreated from genuine frontiers, instead opting for holding actions that can make it feel stable and safe.\par \par \uc2 So we live, thanks to our advanced systems of monitoring, compensation and control, in a bubble of our own devising. And in Curtis's critique, contemporary artists and hipsters do as much to create this bubble as the internet itself. ''On a social-media network, it's very much like being in a heroin bubble. As a radical artist in the 1970s, you used to go and take heroin and wander through the chaos and the collapsing Lower East Side, and you felt safe. That's very like now. You know you aren't safe, but you feel safe because everyone is like you. But you don't have to take heroin, so it's brilliant. You don't get addicted, or maybe you do. Mostly you do.''\par \par \uc2 Under Curtis's riffing spell, gripes so familiar as to be almost embarrassing -- artists paving the way to gentrification, sure; the internet seals us up in self-flattering silos, right -- appear as thunderbolts lighting up a shadowy landscape. For an instant, Patti Smith and Richard Hell are as culpable in the Catastrophe of the Now as Alan Greenspan and Wernher von Braun. Jane Fonda, too. ''Fonda is fascinating because she's 'radical,' and then she does the next shift, which is to say, 'If you can't change the world, you change yourself, your body.' And she kick-starts the VHS revolution with her exercise tapes. Then marries Ted Turner, who doesn't want to analyze the news; he just wants to watch the news.''\par \par \uc2 Curtis paused for breath. ''That's the foundation for this modern conservatism: 'Oh, my God. It's so terrifying. Whatever we do leads to disaster. So what we have to do is shift around and plan for danger, in order to keep stable' -- you have to have the right body mass index -- and instead of analyzing the world in order to change it, you just monitor it for risk.''\par \par \uc2 Curtis's critiques of the internet sometimes echo those of skeptics like Jaron Lanier, who sees it as a dead end for art, and Evgeny Morozov, who questions its ability to effect social change. ''The internet was invented by engineers,'' Curtis tells me. ''When engineers build a bridge, they don't want it to develop, they want it to stay stable. And the same is true of the fundamental engineering system of the internet. It's based on feedback. And feedback is about stability. So, what happened with Occupy, and with Tahrir Square, is that it was a great system to get everyone together into a group, but then it had absolutely no content. It's a really terrible mistake they made -- they mistook an engineering system for a revolutionary set of ideas.''\par \par \uc2 Elsewhere, Curtis sounds like a science-fiction writer -- one from the 1950s, when S.F. writers began accurately satirizing the world we find ourselves in today. ''The utopia they hold out is a world where machines make everything for you and you have endless leisure time, you become creative and everyone's happy. And the only thing is, actually, everyone's incredibly unhappy because they haven't got anything to do. What we call our jobs today are actually fake jobs. We sit in our offices in front of our screens in order to get the money to go out and buy stuff. Our job is really to go shopping. And the rest of the time, we sit in our offices doing complicated managerial things, and when we're not, we're actually watching the internet. The internet is there to keep you happy during your fake job.'' Curtis's antic side, however, can't turn away from the bloody wreckage. ''I see people in shops now, going through \uc2 Instagram\uc2 , and then looking at things like 'Is this right?' It's almost like they're reading the Bible. It's absolutely fascinating. \uc2 Instagram\uc2  is the aestheticization of everything. What began with Modernism, which is to actually worry about how things are done rather than about what they're saying, has now ended with \uc2 Instagram\uc2 . I love it.\par \par \uc2 ''What will happen to the internet in the future?'' He's riffing again. ''Will it become a bit like a John Carpenter movie? You go there, amidst the ruins, and it's weird, and you can be nasty -- just have fun and be bad, like a child. From about '96 to about 2005 people built these lovely websites, they put up masses and masses of fantastic information. They've left them sitting there, but it's like a city that everyone's gone from. And what's come in instead is a weird world where you don't know what's real -- just people shouting at each other. It's good fun, but it's not real.''\par \par \uc2 Though Curtis regards the internet with ambivalence -- and who among us doesn't? -- his current method of disseminating his films, and his ideas, wouldn't be possible without it, particularly in America. This contradiction he embraces. Speaking of ''The Power of Nightmares,'' he told me, ''A lot of people said, 'Oh, the television networks in America would never show it.' What I'd noticed is that the moment I put it out, it went up on the internet. I understood at that point that it would have more political power and be seen by many more people if I let it be a thing that people want to find illegally.'' (Virtually all of Curtis's films are available to the intrepid Googler for free viewing, but if I told you where to find them, they might vanish.)\par \par \uc2 Curtis seems to cherish his place in America as a voice seeping from under the floorboards. In a way, the ruined apocalyptic John Carpenter city appears to be where he wants to live. Even in Britain, Curtis made ''Bitter Lake'' not for television broadcast but as an experiment in releasing his work to the \uc2 BBC\uc2  iPlayer website instead. ''HyperNormalisation'' had an exclusive iPlayer release as well, on Oct. 16. It has freed him, in ''Bitter Lake,'' to play with moody, wordless sequences sustained longer than anything in his earlier pieces, and to include violence too disturbing for television broadcast. ''It's a good place to experiment. The woman who runs iPlayer -- I was the first person to do an original thing for her -- is giving me a great deal of freedom. It won't last. They will bring the palace guards into the internet quite soon, and we'll have to follow more rules, but for the moment it's a very good place to be.''\par \par \uc2 Because Adam Curtis is a journalist, and because \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  is the black hole toward which all journalistic light presently bends, a portion of Curtis's new film concerns the Republican nominee. ''HyperNormalisation'' will be essential viewing for American audiences if for nothing more than a sublime six-minute film-within-a-film that depicts \uc2 Trump\uc2  in his role as a casino proprietor. Curtis tells the story of \uc2 Trump\uc2 's entanglement with a probabilities analyst named Jess Marcum and a Japanese gambler named Akio Kashiwagi, who some believe may have been murdered by the Yakuza.\par \par \uc2 Was it Kashiwagi's mysterious death, which voided a several-millions debt to \uc2 Trump\uc2 , that spurred \uc2 Trump\uc2  out of the risk-laden world of actual construction, investment and management and into the realm of speculative virtuality -- the practice, that is, of selling his name for others to slap onto buildings, even as he became a television and tabloid personality to make that name more valuable? In Curtis's portrait, anyway, \uc2 Trump\uc2  is an avant-garde figure. From the film's narration: ''\uc2 Trump\uc2  had realized that the version of reality that politics presented was no longer believable. ... And in the face of that, you could play with reality.''\par \par \uc2 In the wake of Brexit, though, what did Curtis think of the rise of \uc2 Trump\uc2 ? ''For a lot of the people who support \uc2 Trump\uc2  -- and the new right in Europe -- it's not really nationalism,'' he suggested. ''It's a class thing.'' He thought again for a moment; that wasn't quite it. ''You know when you're told to adopt the brace position in an aircraft because you've got some turbulence? It's as if everyone's in the brace position at the moment, and they don't dare look out of the window and see the world for what it is. All the people terrified of \uc2 Trump\uc2  are in the brace position -- you know, as you gulp another whiskey, 'Oh, my God -- are we going to drop down 20,000 feet?' If you're in that position and someone starts walking around the aisle, you want them to stop. You're in the brace position. They're teasing you. They know you're frightened. They decided to get up and walk around the plane, and you don't like it.''\par \par \uc2 But \uc2 Trump\uc2 's supporters are, of course, also deeply enbubbled. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , according to Curtis, may himself be only another form of feedback system, similar to a chat-bot who replies to you by restating your questions in a flattering style. ''He's a hate-bot. You go, 'I'm angry,' and he goes, 'I'm angry, too!' And nothing changes. But the system likes it: Angry people click more.''\par \par \uc2 I asked whether the prospect of \uc2 Trump\uc2 's actually winning concerned him. At the time of my visit with Curtis, many national polls showed the candidates tied. ''I'm trying to abstract myself from the frightened-bunny view of \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2 ,'' he told me. ''It's the end of something -- that's what I would think -- and if it's the end of something, then it's about time we started inventing something new.''\par \par \uc2 In his pauses I felt Curtis's thinking as a tangible presence in the room. He wasn't so much measuring his willingness to provoke or offend as negotiating with his own frightened-bunny view of the question. ''I mean, I think he's dangerous,'' he concluded, ''but I think there are lots of other dangerous things around in the world.''\par \par \uc2 If the end of this article were the end of an Adam Curtis film, it wouldn't find its way to any very definite conclusion. Instead, the pileup of astounding facts and images and insinuations would leave you wanting both less and more, but with a very certain sense of having been taken out of yourself for a while -- of having tested the edge of the bubble, if not actually escaped it. This is what I like best about his films and what I liked best about picking Curtis's brain up close for three days: Further thinking will always be required.\par \par \uc2 He seems to feel the same way. ''Maybe I'm part of the conservatism that I'm being incredibly rude about,'' he said. Uncovering this reservation seemed almost to delight him. ''I should have the humility to recognize that the sort of films I make are locked in the past. If I was going to really attack myself -- a lot of people also did in the 1990s what I did in film. Which they called sampling. Basically just going and replaying stuff and remaking it into new things, which is really good fun. But fundamentally, it's doing what I'm accusing \uc2 BlackRock\uc2 's computer of doing: constantly monitoring the past, reworking it into other patterns, as a hedge against the future. Am I giving you any vision of the future?'' The question felt earnest, but if I'd said yes he'd have laughed at me.\par \par \uc2 ''In fact, actually the great thing about human beings is that they're protean,'' Curtis told me, near the end, before I let him get back to his editing. ''They can be anything you want them to be. They're amazing. But we're stuck with the idea that there is a fixed self. We're stuck with the idea that there is a body mass index that you must have. We're stuck that this is the food you must have. We're stuck with the system of finance. It's just stuck. And maybe, I'm part of the stuckness.'' Several times, Curtis and I circled back to the notion of the ''hyperobject'' -- that which is too big in time and space to comprehend. Perhaps this is merely shorthand for the sensation of apprehending that we are creatures born into a world that seems to demand our understanding, but will never grant it. ''You have to recognize that you're part of the thing,'' he said. ''But the point about journalism is to try to portray the thing you are part of. I think that's the best you can do.''\par \par \uc2 Jonathan Lethem is the author of 10 novels, including ''A Gambler's Anatomy.''

\par\par \uc2 TALK\par \uc2 Magazine Desk; SECTMM\par \b \uc2 Omarosa Manigault Changed Parties for \uc2 Trump\b0\par\par\uc2 Interview by ANA MARIE COX \par \uc2 747 \uc2 words\par \uc2 30 October 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 78\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 You're a prominent member of \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2 's presidential campaign, as the director of African-American outreach, after competing on ''The Apprentice'' in 2004. Statistically speaking, he does not seem to be having very much success with either women or minorities. Oh, my God, I disagree. When I took the position, we were polling at zero. Nationally, we're at an average of 8 percent. Romney and McCain got around 6 to 7 percent of the African-American vote. Our goal is to get 15 to 20 percent of the African-American vote, and we still think that number is possible.\par \par \uc2 I'm seeing you guys polling at 2 percent. I'll send you the numbers that I have.\par \par \uc2 Do you think the improvement is because of his oft-repeated line, ''What do you have to lose?'' You called it exactly what it is: a line. That is not the totality of our engagement. He's actually employed an entire program in order to reach out to the African-American community.\par \par \uc2 He spends a lot of time talking about how terrible things are for black people -- he has said that if he's elected, black people will ''be able to walk down the street without getting shot.'' I assume you, wherever you live, are able to walk down the street without being shot. Not necessarily.\par \par \uc2 A lot of people don't remember that you were a political appointee in the \uc2 Clinton\uc2  administration. I was in Al Gore's office for a little under a year, and then I moved to the personnel office.\par \par \uc2 I assume you were a Democrat then. Oh, absolutely. I've been very vocal about the fact that I had been a Democrat my entire life. As an African-American, that's what we tend to do. African-Americans are loyal to the Democratic Party, but unfortunately, the Democratic Party is not loyal to them.\par \par \uc2 When did you change your mind? My big split really started during the \uc2 election\uc2  that involved \uc2 Barack Obama\uc2  and \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 . Some of the attack tactics that were used, particularly from the \uc2 Clinton\uc2  camp -- at first, I was very much supportive of Hillary, until I saw how she was treating this African-American man. I went on to support \uc2 Barack Obama\uc2  and work on his campaign in Ohio, but it was then that I saw the fractures in the Democratic Party, and particularly how they treated President Obama. I was really turned off.\par \par \uc2 I understand that disillusionment with the Democratic Party, but was the choice to, specifically, become a Republican made because of \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2 ? When Donald announced, my decision was to support my friend in his desire to become the president of the United States. We jokingly called ourselves Trumplicans at the beginning. For independent-minded voters who want to see a change -- I mean, even his children were not registered Republican. In the last few months, I feel like my eyes have been opened to the need for a greater presence of African-Americans in the Republican Party. Or in any party.\par \par \uc2 Do you have any policy reasons as to why you changed parties? Well, the most obvious is that I believe the Republican Party lines up much more with my Christian beliefs. Many African-Americans will share in that same platform.\par \par \uc2 Recently, \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  tweeted that he is glad about the unendorsements and the lack of support from the G.O.P., because it unshackles him. What do you think that he might say or do now that he wasn't able to do before? I certainly don't want to purport to speak for him. I think both candidates should be focusing on how they're going to improve the lives of the American people. His focus should certainly be on what he is going to do to help make America great again.\par \par \uc2 Do you think he wasn't doing that before? I just can't speculate as to what he purports by that. Because, with Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , you know. ... You never know.\par \par \uc2 Are you disturbed by what \uc2 Trump\uc2  said in those tapes? He apologized. He apologized to his family; they accepted his apology, and so do I.\par \par \uc2 Sign up for our newsletter to get the best of The \uc2 New York Times Magazine\uc2  delivered to your inbox every week.\par \par \uc2 Interview has been condensed and edited.\par \par \uc2 (PHOTOGRAPH BY ANDREW T.

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 At the climax of the Broadway musical ''Hamilton,'' Aaron Burr and \uc2 Alexander Hamilton\uc2  exchange a series of increasingly hostile letters in the song ''Your Obedient Servant.'' Burr enumerates a litany of perceived insults: Hamilton has called him ''amoral'' and ''a dangerous disgrace'' and blocked his political aspirations. ''Burr, your grievance is legitimate,'' Hamilton replies dismissively. ''I stand by what I said, every bit of it/You stand only for yourself/It's what you do/I can't apologize because it's true.'' An outraged Burr feels he has been doubly wronged -- first he is bad-mouthed and then his complaint is answered with a shrug. These irreconcilable differences came to a head on July 11, 1804, in a fatal duel in Weehawken, N.J.\par \par \uc2 The genius of ''Hamilton,'' which opened in February 2015, four months before \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  announced his presidential campaign, was the way in which it made the stuff of history textbooks feel unexpectedly vivid, even contemporary. A year and a half later, the prospect of two political adversaries drawing pistols at dawn over unforgivable insults is perhaps not nearly so remote as we might wish. \uc2 Trump\uc2  is ''unfit, and he proves it every time he talks,'' \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  said in the third presidential debate on Oct. 19. ''No, you are the one that's unfit,'' \uc2 Trump\uc2  fumed. There was no handshake afterward. When the ''Hamilton'' creator Lin-Manuel Miranda hosted ''Saturday Night Live'' last month, he acknowledged the convergence in his rapped opening monologue: ''And, yes, I'm right in my element/Who knew that 'Hamilton' would be so topically relevant?/The way that these grandstanding candidates be talking/They're just a tweet away from facing off in Weehawken!''\par \par \uc2 Grievance is the animating theme of this \uc2 election\uc2  and the natural state of at least one of the candidates; \uc2 Trump\uc2  is a public figure whose ideology, such as it is, essentially amounts to a politics of the personal grudge. It has drawn to him throngs of disaffected citizens all too glad to reclaim the epithet ''deplorable.'' But beyond these aggrieved hordes, it can seem at times as if nearly everyone in the country is nursing wounds, cringing over slights and embarrassments, inveighing against enemies and wishing for retribution. Everyone has someone, or something, to resent -- and often rightfully so.\par \par \uc2 Americans tend to think of rights and grievances in completely different ways -- one as a near-mystical birthright and the other as an unjustice that demands a response -- but they are each part of our political origin story. In 1774, the First Continental Congress sent a Declaration of Rights and Grievances to King George III, protesting that Americans had ''a right peaceably to assemble, consider of their grievances, and petition the King; and that all prosecutions, prohibitory proclamations, and commitments for the same, are illegal'' -- a missive that set the stage for revolt and the Declaration of Independence two years later. A grievance was understood to be a wrong so grave, so serious, that it must be in violation of its twinned opposite, a right. It was the other inalienable principle claimed by the new nation.\par \par \uc2 Since then our politics, and our evolving constitutional rights, have been shaped by the articulation and settling of grievances writ large. Slavery was listed as one of the ''grievances'' in Jefferson's draft of the Declaration of Independence, but struck from the final version; it would take the 13th Amendment to begin to right that wrong. And half the population didn't appear in the founding documents at all. Abigail Adams, the wife of John Adams and a future first lady, wrote to her friend Mercy Otis Warren in 1776 that she had sent ''a List of Female Grievances'' to her husband in Philadelphia, where he was working with the Continental Congress to draft the laws of the new nation. ''I even threatened fomenting a Rebellion in case we were not considered,'' Adams wrote, ''and assured him we would not hold ourselves bound by any Laws in which we had neither a voice, nor representation.''\par \par \uc2 What had been established in those founding documents was a blueprint for how a grievance could be transmuted, through democratic institutions, into a right. In a February 1965 speech in Rochester, Malcolm X reframed the strategy for addressing the persecution and second-class citizenship of black Americans. ''Anyone who classifies his grievances under the label of 'human rights' violations, those grievances can then be brought into the United Nations and be discussed by people all over the world,'' he said. ''For as long as you call it 'civil rights,' your only allies can be the people in the next community, many of whom are responsible for your grievance.'' It was a kind of vision test: Enough people with enough power had to be able to see the problem clearly in order to have it corrected.\par \par \uc2 But as more rights were secured by some, they were resented by others, who saw these gains as their own dispossession. Over the next decades, grumblings arose over government programs, from welfare to affirmative action, intended to target the effects of earlier wrongs. In 2003, the former Democratic governor of Colorado, Richard Lamm, gave a Swiftian three-minute speech at a dinner given by the anti-immigration \uc2 Federation for American Immigration Reform\uc2 . ''I would like to share with you my plan to destroy America,'' he said. As the clinking of forks grew silent, he recited a checklist that ran from bilingualism to high-school dropout rates. ''I would invest in ethnic identity and victimology. I would get them to think that their lack of success was only the fault of the majority. I would start a grievance industry.''\par \par \uc2 Lamm's speech went viral in the far-right reaches of the internet, where it lives on today: a dystopian vision in which the sort of redress demanded by Malcolm X is an engine for the destruction of American society, a redistribution of privilege and prosperity from whites to blacks and a rising tide of immigrants all permanently changing the ''we'' that once defined the nation -- and those who got to rule it.\par \par \uc2 Trump\uc2  likes to tell his roaring crowds that ''we won't have a country anymore'' if he isn't elected. The country he warns against losing is, of course, the very country that Lamm warned against losing; \uc2 Trump\uc2 's candidacy takes that complaint to its logical conclusion. The good old days. Populism. Nationalism. Nativism. All of these are more palatable ways of serving up the same dish: ''The issue of white grievance,'' Bill O'Reilly said on his Fox News show in April, discussing \uc2 Trump\uc2 's supporters, ''is not going away.''\par \par \uc2 This us-against-them movement found its willing avatar in \uc2 Trump\uc2 , a man whose motivations -- even to run for president -- are personal animus, personal gain, a flouting of the rules of engagement and civility, equal-opportunity insults for all. ''We have a bunch of babies running our country, folks,'' \uc2 Trump\uc2  said at a rally in North Carolina on Oct. 21, referring to President Obama and the first lady. ''We have a bunch of losers.'' It's a grudge match with no aim higher than his own standing. ''It's him or me!'' Aaron Burr howls in the song ''The World Was Wide Enough,'' near the end of ''Hamilton,'' in which he narrates the duel and its aftermath. Grievance begets grievance. The personal is political. And history can be hijacked by the consequences.\par \par \uc2 Sign up for our newsletter to get the best of The \uc2 New York Times Magazine\uc2  delivered to your inbox every week.\par \par \uc2 Jessica Lustig is a deputy editor for the magazine.\par \par \uc2 DRAWING (DRAWING BY JAVIER JAEN; SMOKE: MARTIN FISCHER/DREAMSTIME) (MM16) \par \par \uc2 Document NYTF000020161030ecau0007q\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 OPINION\par \uc2 Sunday Review Desk; SECTSR\par \b \uc2 I Know a Rigged \uc2 Election\uc2 . This Isn't One.\b0\par\par\uc2 By GARRY KASPAROV \par \uc2 1,199 \uc2 words\par \uc2 30 October 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 1\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 For the last few weeks, the Republican nominee for president, \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , has been talking a lot about how the Nov. 8 \uc2 election\uc2  is rigged against him. In fact, he sounds convinced that the entire campaign season is rigged in favor of his Democratic opponent, \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 . These are serious charges, or they would be if Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  had any idea what he was talking about.\par \par \uc2 Nobody in the American political establishment is happy about Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's wild-eyed accusations of voter fraud and media conspiracies because they understand that it undermines their own credibility as leaders in a democracy. This is exactly why my country's leader, \uc2 Vladimir V. Putin\uc2 , is so delighted by Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's charges.\par \par \uc2 In power for 16 years now, Mr. Putin and his global propaganda machine aggressively promote the idea that democracy is a chaotic mess that only the hero Putin can save Russia from falling into. Social media is flooded by Kremlin-funded trolls ranting about the illegitimacy of the American \uc2 election\uc2  process and warning of the potential for violence. To have a major party nominee in America repeating this propaganda is beyond Mr. Putin's wildest dreams. Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  even echoes Mr. Putin's authoritarian rationales, presenting himself as the only one who can rescue America.\par \par \uc2 I know a few things about rigged elections. I know what it's like to have the overwhelming power of the state used against me to make a mockery of the democratic process. I know what it means to have my opinion censored while every major media outlet is dedicated to vilifying me and my colleagues. I know what happens when a conspiracy of public and private interests forms to intimidate, harass, prosecute and even kill in order to preserve a monopoly on power.\par \par \uc2 I know these things well because I learned them the hard way during my years as a political opposition leader in Mr. Putin's Russia. None of these things are happening to \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 After I retired from professional chess in 2005, I helped form an opposition coalition, known as Other Russia, to protest Mr. Putin's increasingly dictatorial regime. According to the Russian Constitution, Mr. Putin was unable to stand for a second re-\uc2 election\uc2  as president in 2008, and it wasn't clear what would happen to a power structure that had become completely centered on one man. If Mr. Putin ignored the Constitution completely and simply stayed on openly as a dictator, he risked alienating the Group of 8 world leaders who had agreed to pretend he was a fellow democrat.\par \par \uc2 The Other Russia opposition coalition had live debates, policy papers, platforms -- all the things that were absent from the official elections, where the only thing that mattered was who had the Kremlin's blessing. Rather to my surprise, in 2007 I was the winner of the national primary to choose the coalition's presidential candidate.\par \par \uc2 Once I had been selected in a real \uc2 election\uc2  that wasn't official, it was time for me to participate in an official \uc2 election\uc2  that was completely fake.\par \par \uc2 In order to do this, I had to jump through the official and unofficial hoops that had been put in place to prevent unapproved candidates from making it onto a ballot. Two million signatures were needed from all over the country in just one month, a task made even more herculean by the sheer size of Russia. A nominating congress had to be held, an apparently simple chore that became impossible when no hotel would rent a suitable space to us. Even American-owned hotel chains mysteriously canceled our reservations.\par \par \uc2 While I traveled across the country to campaign, we would find venues suddenly closed for repairs, our flights canceled, our meetings shut down by the police. Nor did I quite manage to stay out of jail, spending five days in a Moscow cell for participating in an ''unauthorized rally.''\par \par \uc2 Rigging an \uc2 election\uc2  isn't only a matter of stuffing ballot boxes. It is not even that ''the people who cast the votes don't decide an \uc2 election\uc2 , the people who count the votes do,'' as the apocryphal quote attributed to Joseph Stalin has it. By the time the voting begins, the game is already over. Anyone who opposes the regime -- from peaceful street protesters to the wealthiest man in the country -- is targeted. The Russian businessman Mikhail Khodorkovsky spent a decade in prison for daring to support political groups outside of Mr. Putin's control.\par \par \uc2 The fraud that does occur on \uc2 Election\uc2  Day is more about showing loyalty and getting the numbers just right to keep up appearances. Busloads of official voters go from polling station to polling station in a tradition we even have a name for: a ''carousel.'' Sheaves of ballots are dumped into urns while polling officials stand in the way to block the view. Sometimes, the excessive zeal of apparatchiks produces returns of more than 100 percent, as happens regularly in Russian regions like Chechnya.\par \par \uc2 To this day, I do not like the title ''former Russian presidential candidate'' because I knew at the start that my name would never appear on a ballot. The former prime minister Mikhail M. Kasyanov was allowed to progress one step further in his own independent run in 2008 -- before being disqualified two months later.\par \par \uc2 The only candidates allowed to run in the presidential \uc2 election\uc2  against Mr. Putin's handpicked successor, the former prime minister Dmitri A. Medvedev, were the same token Communist and the same token nationalist who had been running in every \uc2 election\uc2  since the collapse of the Soviet Union. Mr. Medvedev got 71.2 percent, a tactful few tenths of a percentage point less than Mr. Putin received in 2004. Four years later, Mr. Medvedev again switched desks with Mr. Putin, who hadn't left power for a second regardless of his official title of prime minister. President Obama called Mr. Putin to congratulate him on his \uc2 election\uc2  victory, once again, as president.\par \par \uc2 This is the modern dictatorship, savvy at using the free world's terms and technology for its own ends. And when fake elections at home aren't enough, an aggressive campaign of intimidation and disinformation abroad can be very useful. The Russian news leads every day with Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  and \uc2 WikiLeaks\uc2  and how they are supposedly exposing the corrupt reality of American democracy. Mr. Putin can no longer pretend to be a democratic leader, so his goal is to drag everyone else down to his level -- and he is doing it with Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's help.\par \par \uc2 A democracy is as strong as its people believe it to be. It cannot be destroyed from the outside, only from within.\par \par \uc2 Follow The \uc2 New York Times\uc2  Opinion section on \uc2 Facebook\uc2  and \uc2 Twitter\uc2  (@NYTopinion), and sign up for the Opinion Today newsletter.\par \par \uc2 Garry Kasparov is the chairman of the New York-based Human Rights Foundation and the author, most recently, of ''Winter Is Coming: Why Vladimir Putin and the Enemies of the Free World Must Be Stopped.''\par \par \uc2 (PHOTOGRAPH BY ALEXANDER DEMIANCHUK/REUTERS) (SR6-SR7) \par \par \uc2 Document NYTF000020161030ecau00075\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 OPINION\par \uc2 Sunday Review Desk; SECTSR\par \b \uc2 2008 Was a Celebration. 2016 Is the Opposite.\b0\par\par\uc2 By KAITLYN GREENIDGE \par \uc2 1,454 \uc2 words\par \uc2 30 October 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 3\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 On Nov. 4, 2008, I was 26 years old and had just started working on an oral history project at a museum in Brooklyn. A co-worker and I were asked to interview people at polling places, to memorialize their thoughts about an \uc2 election\uc2  that might put the first African-American president in the White House.\par \par \uc2 We were too shy to actually stop and talk to people. So, instead, we decided to use this as an escape from the office. We drove through Crown Heights, watching as mothers dragged their children into polling places, men huddled on corners to talk, old people walked in groups. Crown Heights' pirate radio station played Arrested Development's ''Revolution'' three times in a row, followed by James Brown singing ''Say It Loud -- I'm Black and I'm Proud.''\par \par \uc2 Later that night, I persuaded a friend to ditch a gig working the coat check at an \uc2 election\uc2  night party on the Upper East Side. ''Do you really want to say you were checking the coats of rich white people on a night like this?'' He came with me to a bar in Prospect Heights. It was packed with people, watching results projected on a screen. Right before they were to announce who had won Pennsylvania, the organizers turned off the feed. ''We want to commemorate this moment with a historic photo,'' they said. An artist famous for taking group nude shots in meaningful places, Spencer Tunick, was there. He wanted to take one now.\par \par \uc2 ''If you want to watch the rest of the \uc2 election\uc2  here, you have to get naked and be in this photo. He's going to take it right at the moment they declare Pennsylvania.'' I looked at my friend. He looked at me. We burst out laughing and both began to unbutton our clothes. At the moment \uc2 Barack Obama\uc2 's win for the state was declared, we were lying on the sticky barroom floor, trying not to think about germs, holding ''New York For \uc2 Obama\uc2 -Biden'' signs above our heads, alongside other naked bargoers -- black, white, brown, old, young, straight and gay.\par \par \uc2 In New York that fall, there was a reggaeton hit about the \uc2 election\uc2  -- just a man chanting ''\uc2 Obama\uc2 '' over a beat. That song played as we pulled our clothes back on, as we ordered drink after celebratory drink, as we ran into the streets to scream and laugh and dance.\par \par \uc2 That night is one of my favorites of my 20s, maybe of my life. Whenever I think of it, I think of the Talking Heads song ''Heaven,'' about a bar called Heaven that always plays your favorite song and where ''nothing ever happens.''\par \par \uc2 Something big did happen that night, but the joy seemed to suspend time, so that future conflict was unimaginable. Here we are, though, eight years later, at the end of a revolution that has not yet happened, in an \uc2 election\uc2  season during which seemingly everything has happened. Even if \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  is elected, I can't imagine experiencing the kind of drunken euphoria that would encourage a person to lie naked on a barroom floor.\par \par \uc2 I know some people are ecstatic about the prospect of the first woman president. Despite the fact that I've never been ambivalent about the need for feminism, I am ambivalent about how much the nature of American power will change because it may wear a female face. And I feel a kind of weary resignation, worried that the worst is yet to come.\par \par \uc2 As much as I celebrate President \uc2 Obama\uc2  as a statesman and a magnetic persona, when I think about that night in 2008, I think of all the ways our country hasn't changed. The na\u239\'00\'EFvet\u233\'00\'E9 has soured. In its place is my disillusionment with a president who continues policies of drone warfare that have killed hundreds of civilians and who has deported huge numbers of Central American children. There is the frustration with a Congress that would rather see the country fail than collaborate with a president they believe to be inferior.\par \par \uc2 There is the real bodily fear for myself and my family in an America that thinks that whether or not black people are human and shouldn't be murdered by the state is a matter that is up for debate. After Michael Brown was killed in Ferguson, Mo., my brother-in-law, who is white, told my sister, ''Every time they shoot a black boy like that, they're imagining shooting the president.''\par \par \uc2 In 2008, commenters fell all over themselves to declare America post-racial. In 2016, it is clear that America's misogyny, like its racism, is intrinsically tied to how many people define our nation.\par \par \uc2 ''It won't stop, when it's over,'' friends say. Anyone who thinks deeply about the amount of vitriol displayed during this \uc2 election\uc2  knows that it cannot disappear overnight. The people spewing hate won't suddenly go back to their lives, polite and free of bias. Some friends say, smugly, ''Don't worry, this is the last dying gasp of hatred in this country.'' But I don't know that I can be that optimistic. The rise of a presidential candidate who has abandoned reality, who is forgiven for every lie and about-face, simply because he's continually willing to disavow people of color and insult women -- that suggests that this will not go away quickly.\par \par \uc2 Grappling with our faults has never been this country's strong suit. We prefer, instead, as Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  said in the second debate, to believe ''we are great because we are good,'' without necessarily demonstrating that goodness.\par \par \uc2 Out of a sinking sense of duty, I tried to make myself watch all three debates. The first one I watched at the house of a friend. Her young son yelled, exasperated, ''Speak English!'' as Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  left sentences hanging broken in the air.\par \par \uc2 The second one, I couldn't watch at all. Before it started, I'd had Sunday dinner with my family -- my sisters, my brother-in-law, my uncle and mother and boyfriend. ''Who's voting for him?'' one of my sisters kept asking, insistent and angry. She has always hated bullies. My other sister said, ''Some of my friends from my mothers' group,'' and then everyone at the table broke into argument, even though we were all agreeing.\par \par \uc2 ''Those women won't vote for \uc2 Clinton\uc2 ,'' my sister said, ''because they say they want to punish her for staying with her husband,'' and that was so depressing that when they all moved to the living room to turn on the debate, I went to another part of the house and sat with my nephew and watched a show about building homes in the trees. He told me a story about Sonic the Hedgehog poisoning the blood of wayward cows -- he took great pleasure in this grotesque make-believe -- and I thought that fiction made more sense than what this \uc2 election\uc2  has become.\par \par \uc2 The final debate I watched at a friend's house with my fingers in my ears -- I can't listen to Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's voice anymore without my stomach tying up in knots. When it was over, I apologized to my host for watching this way. ''I'm a child,'' I said. She smiled and said ''Every person of color I know is doing that metaphorically right now.''\par \par \uc2 A few days later, I brushed my hand against my cheek and found, on the tip of my finger, my first gray eyelash. As if it couldn't be clearer that it was not 2008 anymore, here was the proof in the body, white and glaring. I looked at it for a long moment, thinking of what this meant -- my body is no longer young, this world is so greedy and grasping it's mining the very life of my lashes away. Then I took a photo of it to post to \uc2 Instagram\uc2  and blew the lash away, making a wish.\par \par \uc2 In an attempt to avoid turning every lash white, I have searched for a new motto for after this \uc2 election\uc2 . It is not the lazy hope of a place full of familiar sounds where nothing ever happens. Instead, it's a wish that whatever comes next, we will still have the will to work to fix it.\par \par \uc2 Follow The \uc2 New York Times\uc2  Opinion section on \uc2 Facebook\uc2  and \uc2 Twitter\uc2  (@NYTopinion), and sign up for the Opinion Today newsletter.\par \par \uc2 Kaitlyn Greenidge is the author of the novel ''We Love You, Charlie Freeman.''\par \par \uc2 Election\uc2  night, 2008, as captured by the artist Spencer Tunick.

\par\par \uc2 National Desk; SECTA\par \b \uc2 Justice Dept. Warned F.B.I. About Timing\b0\par\par\uc2 By MATT APUZZO, ADAM GOLDMAN, MICHAEL S. SCHMIDT and WILLIAM K. RASHBAUM; Matt Apuzzo and Adam Goldman reported from Washington, and Michael S. Schmidt and William K. Rashbaum from New York. Noah Weiland contributed reporting from Washington. \par \uc2 1,529 \uc2 words\par \uc2 30 October 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 1\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 WASHINGTON -- The day before the F.B.I. director, James B. Comey, sent a letter to Congress announcing that new evidence had been discovered that might be related to the completed \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  email investigation, the Justice Department strongly discouraged the step and told him that he would be breaking with longstanding policy, three law enforcement officials said on Saturday.\par \par \uc2 Senior Justice Department officials did not move to stop him from sending the letter, officials said, but they did everything short of it, pointing to policies against talking about current criminal investigations or being seen as meddling in elections.\par \par \uc2 That Mr. Comey moved ahead despite those protestations underscores the unusual nature of Friday's revelations, which added a dramatic twist to the final days of the presidential campaign. His action reignited a firestorm that Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  believed she had put behind her when the F.B.I. decided in July not to charge anyone in the investigation into the handling of classified information on her private email server.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Comey's letter did not reopen that inquiry, even as he promised to review the new information, which was discovered in an unrelated investigation into the disgraced former congressman Anthony D. Weiner.\par \par \uc2 Senior Justice Department officials, career prosecutors and even some at the F.B.I. were at a loss on Saturday as to what would happen next. Would Mr. Comey provide a blow-by-blow accounting of the F.B.I.'s steps until \uc2 Election\uc2  Day? Did he plan further announcements? Or did he intend, after shaking up the \uc2 election\uc2  with his letter, to remain silent about the facts until the presidential votes had been tallied?\par \par \uc2 The F.B.I. offered no comment, and Justice Department officials said they had no idea what Mr. Comey saw as his next move. Justice Department officials were particularly puzzled about why Mr. Comey had alerted Congress -- and by extension, the public -- before agents even began reading the newly discovered emails to determine whether they contained classified information or added new facts to the case.\par \par \uc2 Law enforcement officials have begun the process to get court authority to read the emails, officials said. How soon they will get that is unclear, but there is no chance that the review will be completed before \uc2 Election\uc2  Day, several law enforcement officials said. Many of the emails are most likely copies of messages that the F.B.I. has already read, said the officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to comment publicly.\par \par \uc2 Despite the Justice Department's concerns, Mr. Comey felt obligated to send the letter. But it opened him up to fierce criticism not only from Democrats but also from current and former officials at the F.B.I. and the Justice Department, including Republicans.\par \par \uc2 ''There's a longstanding policy of not doing anything that could influence an \uc2 election\uc2 ,'' said George J. Terwilliger III, a deputy attorney general under President George Bush. ''Those guidelines exist for a reason. Sometimes, that makes for hard decisions. But bypassing them has consequences.''\par \par \uc2 He added, ''There's a difference between being independent and flying solo.''\par \par \uc2 After reports surfaced late last month that Mr. Weiner had sent illicit text messages to a 15-year-old girl in North Carolina, top prosecutors in Charlotte and Manhattan jockeyed for the case. Senior officials in the Justice Department decided that if there were a prosecution, it would take place in New York under the supervision of the United States attorney there, Preet Bharara.\par \par \uc2 Almost immediately, it became clear to investigators that the Weiner case might reignite the \uc2 Clinton\uc2  inquiry. Mr. Weiner's estranged wife, Huma Abedin, is a top adviser to Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , and F.B.I. agents in the earlier investigation had interviewed her and reviewed her emails looking for classified information.\par \par \uc2 On Oct. 3, F.B.I. agents seized several electronic devices from Mr. Weiner: a laptop, his iPhone and an iPad that was in large measure used by his 4-year-old son to watch cartoons, a person with knowledge of the matter said. Days later, F.B.I. agents also confiscated a Wi-Fi router that could identify any other devices that had been used, the person said.\par \par \uc2 While searching the laptop, the agents discovered the existence of tens of thousands of emails, some of them sent between Ms. Abedin and other \uc2 Clinton\uc2  aides, according to senior law enforcement officials. It is not clear if Ms. Abedin downloaded the emails to the laptop or if they were automatically backed up there. The emails dated back years, the officials said. Ms. Abedin has testified that she did not routinely delete her emails.\par \par \uc2 Because of the age of the emails, many could be outside the scope of the \uc2 Clinton\uc2  inquiry, investigators said. And while many are probably duplicative, some would be worth reading, the F.B.I. concluded.\par \par \uc2 In conversations this month, senior Justice Department and F.B.I. officials agreed that the matter was worth pursuing. By law, though, agents and prosecutors in the \uc2 Clinton\uc2  investigation could not immediately read the new emails without court authority.\par \par \uc2 The authorities decided only recently to seek that approval. They do not know whether the emails contain classified information or, if they do, whether that would change their determination that nobody should be charged with mishandling it.\par \par \uc2 So Justice Department officials were surprised on Thursday afternoon to receive notice of Mr. Comey's intention to send the letter to Congress. The letter, issued as early voting was underway in some states, guaranteed a new round of questions for Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  just before \uc2 Election\uc2  Day.\par \par \uc2 The Justice Department and the F.B.I. have a longstanding policy against discussing current criminal investigations. Another Justice Department policy, restated each \uc2 election\uc2  cycle, declares that politics should play no role in investigative decisions. Both Democratic and Republican administrations have interpreted that policy broadly to cover any steps that might give even an impression of partisanship.\par \par \uc2 ''We must be particularly sensitive to safeguarding the department's reputation for fairness, neutrality and nonpartisanship,'' said a 2012 memo from the attorney general's office that restated the policy.\par \par \uc2 But although Mr. Comey told Congress this summer that the \uc2 Clinton\uc2  investigation was complete, he believed that if word of the new emails leaked out -- and it was sure to leak out, he concluded -- he risked being accused of misleading Congress and the public ahead of an \uc2 election\uc2 , colleagues said.\par \par \uc2 Attorney General Loretta E. Lynch did not directly speak with Mr. Comey about the matter, officials said, but senior Justice Department officials sent word of her concerns. Though Ms. Lynch is technically Mr. Comey's boss, she, too, faced a dilemma. If she ordered Mr. Comey not to send the letter, it could appear that she was trying to withhold information from Congress.\par \par \uc2 After hearing the Justice Department's argument, Mr. Comey concluded that the ramifications of not telling Congress far outweighed concerns about the department guidelines, one senior law enforcement official said.\par \par \uc2 On Friday, Mr. Comey sent Congress the letter, which said emails had surfaced in a case unrelated to the \uc2 Clinton\uc2  case. Mr. Comey said that the F.B.I. would review the emails to determine if they improperly contained classified information, adding that the emails ''appear to be pertinent.''\par \par \uc2 It was the latest example of a sometimes strained relationship between the Justice Department and Mr. Comey, who -- on issues of race, encryption, policing and, most notably, the \uc2 Clinton\uc2  investigation -- has branded himself as someone who operates outside Washington's typical chain of command.\par \par \uc2 The letter rankled Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's supporters in part because Mr. Comey has been circumspect in his remarks about another federal investigation, this one involving allegations of Russian meddling in the \uc2 election\uc2 . American officials believe that Russian intelligence agents are behind the hacking of \uc2 Democratic National Committee\uc2  emails, which have embarrassed the \uc2 Clinton\uc2  campaign.\par \par \uc2 Senior Democrats have called on the F.B.I. to investigate whether any of \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's aides are colluding with Russia. Some of his aides have ties to Russian interests, but they have denied any wrongdoing.\par \par \uc2 While Mr. Comey told Congress last month that he would not confirm the existence of any investigation into people associated with Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , he said he felt compelled to discuss details of the \uc2 Clinton\uc2  investigation because it involved ''exceptional circumstances where the public needed information.''\par \par \uc2 Matthew Miller, a Democrat and former Justice Department spokesman who has criticized Mr. Comey's handling of the email investigation, said the F.B.I. director should not pick and choose when to follow the guidelines.\par \par \uc2 ''You can't apply the usual standard to one candidate and an entirely different set of rules for the other,'' he said.\par \par \uc2 James B. Comey, the F.B.I. director, in July. His letter to Congress opened him to fierce criticism.

\par\par \uc2 OP-ED COLUMNIST\par \uc2 Sunday Review Desk; SECTSR\par \b \uc2 The Dangers of \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\b0\par\par\uc2 By ROSS DOUTHAT \par \uc2 895 \uc2 words\par \uc2 30 October 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 11\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 IN last Sunday's column, I wrote about the dangers that a Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  presidency poses for the country. Since this is the final week for Hillary skeptics to agonize over whether to cast a vote for \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2 , it seems appropriate to outline why the risks of \uc2 Trump\uc2  are so distinctive as to throw the perils of a \uc2 Clinton\uc2  presidency into relative eclipse.\par \par \uc2 This is a challenging thing to explain because \uc2 Trump\uc2  is, among recent American politicians, sui generis. The mistakes and blunders that an establishment liberal like \uc2 Clinton\uc2  is likely to make can be envisioned by looking at peers like Angela Merkel, at recent occupants of the White House, at Hillary's own record. But there are no obvious analogues for a President \uc2 Trump\uc2 ; all the comparables, from \uc2 Arnold Schwarzenegger\uc2  to \uc2 Silvio Berlusconi\uc2 , only reflect part of what we would get with the Republican nominee as a superpower's president.\par \par \uc2 So considering the dangers of \uc2 Trump\uc2  requires a grounded speculation, which is what I'll attempt here. These are not my worst-case scenarios: They do not involve \uc2 Trump\uc2  making baldly authoritarian moves or accidentally touching off nuclear war. Rather, they're three baseline dangers for a \uc2 Trump\uc2  administration, three perils that we would very likely face.\par \par \uc2 The first is sustained market jitters, leading to an economic slump. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's \uc2 election\uc2  alone would probably induce a Brexit-esque stock market dip, but the real problem would be what happened next. Instead of Theresa May's steadiness inspiring a return to fundamentals, you would have the spectacle -- and it will be a spectacle -- of the same \uc2 Trump\uc2  team that drop-kicked its policy shop and barely organized a national campaign trying to staff up an administration. Even without his promised pivot to mercantilism and trade war, a White House run as a \uc2 Trump\uc2  production is likely to mainline anxiety into the economy, sidelining capital, discouraging hiring and shaving points off the G.D.P.\par \par \uc2 The second peril is major civil unrest. Some of \uc2 Trump\uc2 's supporters imagine that his \uc2 election\uc2  would be a blow to left-wing activists, that his administration would swiftly reverse the post-Ferguson crime increase. This is a bit like imagining that a President George Wallace would have been good for late-1960s civil peace. In reality, \uc2 Trump\uc2 's \uc2 election\uc2  would be a gift to bad cops and riot-ready radicals in equal measure, and his every intervention would pour gasoline on campuses and cities -- not least because as soon as any protest movement had a face or leader, \uc2 Trump\uc2  would be on cable bellowing ad hominems at them.\par \par \uc2 The third likely highly-plausible peril, and by far the most serious, is a rapid escalation of risk in every geopolitical theater. It's probably true that \uc2 Trump\uc2 , given his pro-Russia line, would be somewhat less likely than \uc2 Clinton\uc2  to immediately stumble into confrontation with \uc2 Vladimir Putin\uc2  over Syria. But it's silly to imagine Moscow slipping into a comfortable d\u233\'00\'E9tente with a President \uc2 Trump\uc2 ; Putin is more likely to pocket concessions and keep pushing, testing the orange-haired dealmaker at every opportunity and leaving \uc2 Trump\uc2  poised, very dangerously, between overreaction and his least-favorite position -- looking weak.\par \par \uc2 That's just Russia: From the Pacific Rim to the Middle East, revisionist powers will set out to test \uc2 Trump\uc2 's capacity to handle surprise, hostile actors will seek to exploit the undoubted chaos of his White House, and our allies will build American fecklessness into their strategic plans. And again, all of this is likely to happen without \uc2 Trump\uc2  doing the wilder things he's kind-of sort-of pledged to do -- demanding tribute from allies, trying to ''take the oil,'' etc. He need only be himself in order to bring an extended period of risk upon the world.\par \par \uc2 The history of geopolitics prior to the Pax Americana is rife with examples of why this sort of testing should be feared. Overall, \uc2 Trump\uc2 's foreign policy hazing, his rough introduction to machtpolitik, promises more danger for global stability -- still a real and valuable thing, recent crises notwithstanding -- than the risks incurred by George W. Bush's interventionism, Barack Obama's attempt at offshore balancing, or (yes) \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's possible exposure of classified material to the Chinese, the Russians and Anthony Weiner's sexting partners.\par \par \uc2 There is no algorithm that can precisely calibrate how to weigh global instability against the reasons that remain for conservatives to vote for \uc2 Trump\uc2 . No mathematical proof can demonstrate that the chance of a solidly-conservative Supreme Court justice isn't worth a scaled-up risk of great power conflict.\par \par \uc2 But I think that reluctant \uc2 Trump\uc2  supporters are overestimating the systemic durability of the American-led order, and underestimating the extent to which a basic level of presidential competence and self-control is itself a matter of life and death -- for Americans, and for human beings the world over.\par \par \uc2 I may be wrong. But none of my fears (and I have many) of what a Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  presidency will bring are strong enough to make me want to run the risk of being proven right.\par \par \uc2 I invite you to follow me on Twitter (@DouthatNYT).\par \par \uc2 Follow The \uc2 New York Times\uc2  Opinion section on \uc2 Facebook\uc2  and Twitter (@NYTopinion), and sign up for the Opinion Today newsletter.\par \par \uc2 Document NYTF000020161030ecau0005t\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2  contributed another $10 million to his presidential campaign on Friday, providing a needed financial boost to his bid at a critical juncture.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's donation was revealed in disclosures filed late Friday night with the \uc2 Federal \uc2 Election\uc2  Commission\uc2 . He had pledged to make the donation in an interview aired earlier in the evening with the Fox New host Bret Baier.\par \par \uc2 The donation came after earlier disclosures, filed on Thursday, revealed that Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  had not contributed any cash to his campaign in October despite claims that he would be spending heavily and despite earlier pledges to match the small contributions of his grass-roots supporters. That earlier disclosure covered only the first three weeks of October; Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  typically wires money to his campaign toward the end of the month.\par \par \uc2 The donation brings Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  closer to his promise of spending $100 million of his own money on his presidential bid, which he says would allow him to remain clear of the influence of special interests. As of Friday, he had contributed $65.5 million in cash and a half-million dollars more of in-kind rent and staff salaries.\par \par \uc2 As of mid-October, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  had only $16 million in cash on hand, a small amount for a modern presidential campaign, and additional cash in joint accounts he controls. \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  had $62.4 million.\par \par \uc2 Find out what you need to know about the 2016 presidential race today, and get politics news updates via \uc2 Facebook\uc2 , \uc2 Twitter\uc2  and the First Draft newsletter.\par \par \uc2 Document NYTF000020161030ecau00065\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 OPINION\par \uc2 Sunday Review Desk; SECTSR\par \b \uc2 How \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  Met Satan\b0\par\par\uc2 By SUSAN FALUDI \par \uc2 1,166 \uc2 words\par \uc2 30 October 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 5\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 It was my third day at the Republican National Convention in 1996, and my notebook overflowed with a one-note theme: ''You do know that \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  is funding the whole radical feminist agenda?'' ''She had Vince Foster killed.'' ''She's behind many more murders than that.'' ''It's well-established that \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  belonged to a satanic cult, still does.'' The consensus among Pat Buchanan's supporters seemed ardent and universal, though the object of this obloquy wasn't even on the opposing ticket.\par \par \uc2 One of the mysteries of 2016 is the degree to which \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  is reviled. Not just rationally opposed but viscerally and instinctively hated. None of the stated reasons for the animus seem to satisfy. Yes, she's careful and cagey, and her use of a private email server, which the F.B.I. flung back into the news on Friday, was a big mistake. But no, she's not more dishonest than other politicians, and compared with her opponent, she's George Washington. Her policies, even where bold, are hardly on the subversive fringe.\par \par \uc2 Yet she's cast not just as a political combatant but as a demon who, in the imaginings of Republicans like Paul D. Ryan, the speaker of the House, and Representative Trent Franks, would create an America ''where passion -- the very stuff of life -- is extinguished'' (the former) and where fetuses would be destroyed ''limb from limb'' (the latter).\par \par \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2  and his supporters posit their antipathy as a reaction to Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's accumulated record over ''30 years in power.'' It's important to recall that she was deranging Republicans on Day 1. Understanding her demonization requires admitting her full significance in our political history, for she is not simply a pioneering woman fighting an Ur-misogyny. Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  faces a two-headed Cerberus, an artificial conjoining that occurred in the early 1990s, of wounded Republican invincibility and wounded male prerogative. Our current political crisis won't be resolved until those forces are separated and the Cerberus slain.\par \par \uc2 Few current observers seem to recall the wrath that greeted \uc2 Bill \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's ascension. To the left, ''Clintonism'' implies accommodation and calculation. But to the right in 1992, it meant usurpation. Reaganism held almost religious significance, and its reign was supposed to be transformative and permanent. For the One True Way to be restored, Clintonism had to be delegitimized.\par \par \uc2 That delegitimization ushered in the politics of party restoration at whatever cost, governance and country be damned. This led first to an attempted legislative coup in 1998 and then to a judicial coup in 2000. And to all the more recent outrages of birtherism, government shutdowns, delayed Supreme Court confirmations and, ultimately, the rise of a would-be autocrat as a party nominee.\par \par \uc2 But political restoration was only one head of the Cerberus. The other -- wounded male prerogative -- was personal and sexual. The 1990s produced a generation of men who felt (and still feel) left behind by a society redefining power and success in terms of ornament and celebrity and demoting the value of industry and brawn, while simultaneously challenging men's value as family providers. Though women weren't the source of men's pain, the antagonist conjured up by aggrieved men I talked with in those years had a feminine face, and very often that face was Hillary's.\par \par \uc2 A startling aspect of the rage that greeted \uc2 Bill \uc2 Clinton\uc2  was how much of it was aimed at the women he entrusted -- or tried to entrust -- with power. When I was investigating one of the early skirmishes of the \uc2 Clinton\uc2  years, the burning of the Branch Davidian compound in Waco, Tex., which right-wingers attributed to \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's F.B.I., I was treated to the fervent rants of ''Patriot'' men, aimed not at Mr. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  but at what I came to think of as the Three Witches of Waco: Attorney General Janet Reno (''Reno's master is Satan,'' a Third Continental Congress militiaman told me), the gun-control advocate Sarah Brady and, most of all, Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 . Her anti-male conspiracies were legion: redirecting their tax dollars to bankroll women's rights around the globe (''She gave away a million dollars to each first lady she visited in Africa to get educated''), using their Social Security to ''pay for abortion,'' and ''calling the shots at the White House.''\par \par \uc2 Republican ideological absolutism, nourished by masculine insecurity, created an amalgam corrosive to pragmatic politics. For \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , it's meant being demonized for traits that have little to do with her character. Not only by right-wing politicians, who found the Hillary-with-horns specter a convenient recruitment tool, but by the culture at large. Even the supposedly liberal mainstream media still seek out any bit of evidence that can be chiseled to fit that prefab 1990s narrative -- and if she denies the caricature, she's called a liar. Her famous ''hiddenness'' is, at heart, her refusal to cop to the crime of purloined male authority. A Spy magazine story in 1995 made that theft succinct: a cover image of a grinning Hillary, her skirt billowing up as in the old Marilyn Monroe photo, to reveal male briefs bulging with a penis. Across her legs ran the headline: ''Hillary's Big Secret.''\par \par \uc2 The G.O.P.'s gender grudge feeds on its own defeat. As the culture moves further away from the conservative ideal -- as women gain freedoms, minorities assert rights, same-sex marriage proves commonplace -- the monster's howls grow louder. But the howls say nothing new. This \uc2 election\uc2  is the decisive battle in a Thirty Years' War.\par \par \uc2 ''We're going to fight this if it takes a hundred years,'' one of the Patriots I met in Waco advised me. ''Our republic's on its knees. Our throat is about to be slit.'' And then: ''Radical feminism gave the government all this power.'' Flash forward to October of 2016, as \uc2 Trump\uc2  supporters, egged on by their candidate, talk openly about getting their guns to ''take out'' the ''radical feminist'' candidate who has declared ''open war against men.''\par \par \uc2 The left needs to acknowledge what the right has long known: that it's a fiction to think we can move on beyond the brawl of the 1990s without settling it -- and settling it requires helping Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  triumph once and for all against the calumnies that were created to define her. It would be a mistake to think that Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , the imperfect politician, is not the right standard-bearer for this fight. She was nominated to her role not last July at the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia, but in 1992, when her husband destroyed the myth of Republican invincibility and \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  was anointed the feminine face of evil.\par \par \uc2 Susan Faludi is the author of ''Backlash: The Undeclared War Against American Women'' and, most recently, ''In the Darkroom.''\par \par \uc2 (PHOTOGRAPH BY SARA KRULWICH/THE NEW YORK TIMES) \par \par \uc2 Document NYTF000020161030ecau00062\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 National Desk; SECTA\par \b \uc2 Clinton\uc2  Shifts to Attack Mode on Email Issue\b0\par\par\uc2 By PATRICK HEALY and JONATHAN MARTIN; Reporting was contributed by Yamiche Alcindor, Nick Corasaniti, Matt Flegenheimer, Jack Healy and Thomas Kaplan. \par \uc2 1,771 \uc2 words\par \uc2 30 October 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 1\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  and her allies sprang onto a war footing on Saturday, opening a ferocious attack on the F.B.I.'s director, James B. Comey, a day after he disclosed that his agency was looking into a potential new batch of messages from her private email server.\par \par \uc2 Treating Mr. Comey as a threat to her candidacy, Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  took aim at the law enforcement officer who had recommended no criminal charges less than four months earlier for her handling of classified information as secretary of state.\par \par \uc2 ''It's pretty strange to put something like that out with such little information right before an \uc2 election\uc2 ,'' Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  said at a rally in Daytona Beach, Fla. ''In fact, it's not just strange; it's unprecedented and it is deeply troubling.''\par \par \uc2 For Democrats, it was also deeply worrying. Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's advisers expressed concern that the F.B.I.'s renewed attention to emails relating to the nominee would turn some voters against her, hurt party candidates in competitive House and Senate races, and complicate efforts to win over undecided Americans in the final days of the \uc2 election\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 So after stepping gingerly around the issue on Friday, calling on Mr. Comey to release more specific information but not overtly criticizing him, her campaign made it personal on Saturday, accusing the director of smearing Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  with innuendo late in the race and of violating Justice Department rules.\par \par \uc2 The decision to target Mr. Comey for his unusual decision to publicly disclose the inquiry came during an 8 a.m. internal conference call, after aides saw reports that Justice Department officials were furious, believing he had violated longstanding guidelines advising against such actions so close to an \uc2 election\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Even before Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  spoke in Florida, her campaign chairman, \uc2 John D. Podesta\uc2 , and campaign manager, Robby Mook, criticized Mr. Comey for putting out incomplete information and breaking with Justice Department protocol.\par \par \uc2 ''By providing selective information, he has allowed partisans to distort and exaggerate to inflict maximum political damage,'' Mr. Podesta said during a conference call with reporters. ''Comey has not been forthcoming with the facts,'' he added, describing the director's letter to Congress on Friday as ''long on innuendo.''\par \par \uc2 Whatever shortcomings Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  may have as a candidate, Saturday's coordinated effort showed that the political organization that she, her husband and her allies had built over decades remained potent and would not let what seemed like victory erode easily. By midday, Mr. Comey, a Republican appointed by President Obama and confirmed nearly unanimously by the Senate, found himself in its cross hairs.\par \par \uc2 Encouraged by Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's senior aides to reframe the story and make it about Mr. Comey's actions, liberal groups such as the \uc2 Congressional Black Caucus\uc2  demanded that he release more information. Other surrogates were emailed talking points prodding them to deem it ''extraordinary that 11 days before the \uc2 election\uc2  a letter like this -- with so few details -- would be sent to 8 Republican committee chairmen.'' (Ranking Democrats on the committees also received copies.)\par \par \uc2 Mr. Comey has not publicly commented on the investigation, other than with the letter saying that more emails were being examined. He also wrote an email to F.B.I. employees explaining that he felt he had to inform Congress even though the agency did not yet know ''the significance of this newly discovered collection of emails.''\par \par \uc2 With Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  leading \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2  in nearly every battleground state, \uc2 Clinton\uc2  advisers were emphatic that they would not be thrown off stride. They said they would not change any political strategy, television advertising or campaign travel plans.\par \par \uc2 For months, the F.B.I. had investigated whether Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  had broken any laws by using a private email server while she was secretary of state. This past summer, Mr. Comey said that Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  had been ''extremely careless'' by allowing sensitive information to be discussed outside secure government servers, but that the agency had concluded that Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  had not committed a crime. The investigation was closed.\par \par \uc2 But on Friday, Mr. Comey notified Congress that the agency had discovered emails, possibly relevant to the investigation, that belonged to Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's top aide, Huma Abedin. The emails were discovered on the computer of Ms. Abedin's estranged husband, Anthony D. Weiner, during a separate investigation into allegations that he had exchanged sexually explicit messages with a teenager.\par \par \uc2 According to several \uc2 Clinton\uc2  advisers, Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  told them overnight and on Saturday that she wanted the campaign to operate normally, not rashly, while pressuring Mr. Comey to dispel any possibility that her candidacy was under legal threat.\par \par \uc2 But the \uc2 Clinton\uc2  team also had to deal with a newly emboldened Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , who urged voters at a rally on Saturday in Golden, Colo., to oppose Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  because of her ''criminal action'' that was ''willful, deliberate, intentional and purposeful.''\par \par \uc2 Handed a new opening against Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  used the moment to baselessly claim there had been an internal F.B.I. ''revolt'' and made a sexually suggestive joke about Mr. Weiner.\par \par \uc2 ''As Podesta said, she's got bad instincts,'' Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  said, distorting a comment in one of the thousands of Mr. Podesta's hacked emails recently released by \uc2 WikiLeaks\uc2 . ''Well, she's got bad instincts when her emails are on Anthony Weiner's wherever.''\par \par \uc2 The paramount fear among \uc2 Clinton\uc2  advisers and Democratic officials was that an \uc2 election\uc2  that had become a referendum on Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's fitness for office, and that had increasingly seemed to be Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's to lose, would now become just as much about her conduct.\par \par \uc2 In phone calls, email chains and text messages on Saturday, \uc2 Clinton\uc2  aides and allies were by turns confident that the F.B.I. would find nothing to hurt Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  and concerned that the inquiry would nudge demoralized Republicans to show up to vote for down-ballot candidates -- and perhaps even cast ballots, however reluctantly, for the battered Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 ''This is like an 18-wheeler smacking into us, and it just becomes a huge distraction at the worst possible time,'' said Donna Brazile, the chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee and a close \uc2 Clinton\uc2  ally. ''We don't want it to knock us off our game. But on the second-to-last weekend of the race, we find ourselves having to tell voters, 'Keep your focus; keep your eyes on the prize.'''\par \par \uc2 As much as \uc2 Clinton\uc2  advisers stressed that they were not panicking, some of them radiated anger at Mr. Comey, Mr. Weiner and even Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  -- a reflection of 18 months of frustration that her personal decisions about her email practices and privacy were still generating unhelpful political drama. Two \uc2 Clinton\uc2  aides, for example, pointedly noted in interviews that it was difficult to press a counterattack without fully knowing what was in Ms. Abedin's emails.\par \par \uc2 Some prominent Democratic women, meanwhile, were angry that a murky announcement from the F.B.I. might impede the \uc2 election\uc2  of the first female president of the United States.\par \par \uc2 ''It worries me because it gives the Republicans something to blow up and fan folks' anger with,'' said former Representative Patricia Schroeder of Colorado, who considered a run for the Democratic nomination for president in 1988. ''I was on the Judiciary Committee when I was in Congress, and I have never seen the F.B.I. handle any case the way they have handled hers.''\par \par \uc2 While some voters are undecided, about 20 million Americans have already cast ballots in early voting, and millions more long ago concluded which candidate they would support.\par \par \uc2 In a polarized country where many are unwaveringly contemptuous of either Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  or Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , the latest development in the email story prompted a mix of shrugs and renewed determination from the left and told-you-so claims of \uc2 Clinton\uc2  perfidy from the right.\par \par \uc2 ''My mind was made up,'' said Luis Luaces, 57, a Florida Republican who expressed little surprise about the Weiner email twist as he cast his ballot for Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  on Saturday in Miami. ''I know what the Clintons are about.''\par \par \uc2 Democrats also said the development had done little to alter their perceptions. In Charlotte, N.C., Ian Leemans, 35, a Democrat, said he had been at work checking news sites when he saw a flashing banner with Friday's news. He had already planned to vote early for Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , but after the news, he felt even more urgency to cast his ballot.\par \par \uc2 ''I thought, O.K., this is going to be an advantage for \uc2 Trump\uc2  people to say, 'Oh, it is a rigged \uc2 election\uc2 ,''' Mr. Leemans said. ''So I thought, 'Oh, I need to make sure I get up at 8 o'clock on a Saturday and vote.'''\par \par \uc2 Several Republican pollsters and strategists said that given Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's weakness, the F.B.I. inquiry was more likely to help the party's candidates for the House and Senate than to transform the political fortunes of Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 ''To the extent this affects relative enthusiasm among Republicans and Democrats, it helps down-ballot Republicans,'' said Whit Ayres, a pollster advising one such candidate seeking re-\uc2 election\uc2 , Senator \uc2 Marco Rubio\uc2  of Florida. Referring to Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's lead over Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  in recent polls, Mr. Ayres added, ''The margin at the top of the ticket is large enough so that it probably takes an indictment, rather than an investigation, to move those numbers sufficiently.''\par \par \uc2 With control of the Senate on a knife's edge and Democrats wielding Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's unpopularity like a weapon to make gains in the House, Republicans were exultant to at least get off the defensive.\par \par \uc2 While few Republicans were willing to argue that Mr. Comey's letter could revive Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , they said that the new revelations dovetailed with a message they were already pushing: that Democratic candidates would only enable Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's instinct for secrecy and not hold her accountable.\par \par \uc2 ''It boosts the check-and-balance argument because it is a reminder of all of the things voters hate about \uc2 Clinton\uc2 ,'' said Rob Simms, the executive director of the House Republican campaign arm.\par \par \uc2 Find out what you need to know about the 2016 presidential race today, and get politics news updates via \uc2 Facebook\uc2 , \uc2 Twitter\uc2  and the First Draft newsletter.\par \par \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  at Bethune-Cookman University's homecoming football game as she campaigned Saturday in Daytona Beach, Fla.

\par\par \uc2 Politics; SECT\par \b \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  Questions Veracity of Ballot Counting in Colorado\b0\par\par\uc2 By NICK CORASANITI \par \uc2 465 \uc2 words\par \uc2 30 October 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 The New York Times on the Web\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 GOLDEN, Colo. -- Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2  has found a new reason to question the legitimacy of the 2016 \uc2 election\uc2  -- ballots -- and he wasted little time here on Saturday before taking issue with the voting system in this largely vote-by-mail state.\par \par \uc2 ''I have real problems with ballots being sent,'' Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  said, pantomiming a ballot collector sifting envelopes and tossing some over his shoulder while counting others.\par \par \uc2 ''If you don't have a ballot, they give you another one and they void your one at home,'' he told the crowd at an afternoon rally, explaining how voters could go fill out their ballot at the back of the venue here. ''And then, of course, the other side would send that one in too, but, you know, we don't do that stuff. We don't do that stuff.''\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's repetitive accusations of a ''rigged'' \uc2 election\uc2  and a slanted electoral system are grounded in the belief that fraudulent behavior would only help his opponent.\par \par \uc2 Yet it was a \uc2 Trump\uc2  supporter in Des Moines who was charged on Thursday with a Class D felony in Iowa, having sent in two absentee ballots, both supporting Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 The voter, Terri Rote, told Iowa Public Radio that she had not planned to send in two ballots, but made a ''spur of the moment'' decision.\par \par \uc2 ''The polls are rigged,'' she added, repeating a line often said by Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 The Polk County attorney, John P. Sarcone, told Iowa Public Radio that it was one of the very few instances of voter fraud that he had come across in his more than three decades of service. And nationally, voter fraud is rare, despite Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's insistence.\par \par \uc2 Nonetheless, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  seemed undeterred in his wariness of the security of ballots, despite the same process having been in place when Cory Gardner, a Republican, defeated the incumbent Democratic senator, Mark Udall, in 2014. Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  closed his rally by encouraging his supporters to ''follow their ballots'' to make sure they are registered and counted.\par \par \uc2 ''You can follow your ballot, make sure that ballot is registered, make sure that ballot is counted,'' he said, later adding, ''So follow your ballot, and if you do I, really think were gonna win Colorado and maybe win it big.''\par \par \uc2 Lynn Bartels, the spokeswoman for the Colorado secretary of state's office, said the electoral process in the state was secure.\par \par \uc2 The most recent polling out of Colorado, a \uc2 Quinnipiac\uc2  poll from two weeks ago, found Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  had a lead of eight points in the state.\par \par \uc2 Find out what you need to know about the 2016 presidential race today, and get politics news updates via \uc2 Facebook\uc2 , \uc2 Twitter\uc2  and the First Draft newsletter.\par \par \uc2 Document NYTF000020161030ecau0004o\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 PHOENIX -- Arizona was shaping up to be one of the more unlikely battlegrounds of the 2016 campaign when a political bombshell appeared to explode last week: The Obama administration revealed that the cost of midlevel plans on the Affordable Care Act's health insurance marketplace here would increase next year by 116 percent on average.\par \par \uc2 Senator \uc2 John McCain\uc2 , running for re-\uc2 election\uc2  against the headwind of \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , took the bad news as a gift, highlighting it in a new television ad that begins, ''When you open up your health insurance bill and find your premiums are doubling, remember that McCain strongly opposes Obamacare.'' Other Republican candidates here also seized on the rate increases, counting on the issue to buoy them with \uc2 Election\uc2  Day imminent and Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  losing ground in the Republican-dominated state.\par \par \uc2 But as with everything related to the Affordable Care Act, it is complicated. The rate increases had been predicted for months as insurer after insurer announced plans to drop out of the marketplace here. Very few Arizonans are directly affected. Voting has already begun, and the political environment has been largely fixed for months, defined by deep divisions over immigration, \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's emails and Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's fitness for office.\par \par \uc2 The rate increases, in fact, are unlikely to be a deciding factor.\par \par \uc2 Leslie Rycroft of Scottsdale, who works in human resources, is paying $1,100 a month this year for a United Healthcare plan that has a $13,000 deductible for her family of four. Their income was a little too high to qualify for a subsidy, she said. When she looked at her options on HealthCare.gov last week, she said she was ''absolutely horrified'' to see only one insurer, Health Net, offering plans that started at $2,200 a month. ''It's beyond ridiculous,'' she said. ''All of a sudden you are paying $26,000 a year,'' Ms. Rycroft said, ''just for catastrophic health insurance.''\par \par \uc2 Still, Ms. Rycroft, 59, said she had already cast her vote for \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 . A registered Republican, she finds Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  ''abhorrent,'' she said. She did split her ticket and voted for Mr. McCain instead of his Democratic opponent, Representative Ann Kirkpatrick, because of his national security experience, she said.\par \par \uc2 Shortly after Ms. Rycroft learned about her rate increase, she got a reprieve in the form of a job offer. Her new job will provide insurance starting in January.\par \par \uc2 On Monday, the Obama administration confirmed what many Arizonans had already suspected, publishing premiums for policies offered under the Affordable Care Act that revealed that Arizona faces the biggest average rate increase in the country. The news was even worse in Phoenix, the nation's sixth-largest city, where the price of a midlevel plan will increase by 145 percent on average.\par \par \uc2 Insurers rushed into the Phoenix market in the early years of the Affordable Care Act, offering some of the lowest prices in the country. But many younger, healthier people failed to enroll, and sick people flocked to the Arizona exchange, taking advantage of the law's prohibition on denying coverage for pre-existing medical conditions. It now appears that many insurers severely underpriced their premiums, and they are now making up for that error by either jacking up rates or simply leaving the marketplace.\par \par \uc2 The fourth open enrollment for Affordable Care Act plans starts Tuesday, and in Phoenix and its suburbs, only one insurer, Health Net, a subsidiary of \uc2 Centene\uc2 , is offering plans for next year, compared with eight this year.\par \par \uc2 Many customers, particularly those with lower incomes, will not be affected by the price increase; the subsidies that the law provides to help pay premiums will cover most or all of it. Seventy-four percent of Arizonans with marketplace plans got subsidies this year, and the percentage is expected to grow next year.\par \par \uc2 But for those whose incomes are too high to qualify for premium subsidies -- people who earn more than 400 percent of the federal poverty level, or $97,200 for a family of four -- the price increases will be excruciating.\par \par \uc2 ''When things flare up around Obamacare, it tends to motivate Republicans,'' said Glenn Hamer, president and chief executive of the Arizona Chamber of Commerce and Industry. ''I would say with 100 percent certainty that this is going to help Republicans. How much? Who knows?''\par \par \uc2 Most Arizonans have health insurance through their jobs. About 180,000, or less than 3 percent of the population, had insurance through the Affordable Care Act marketplace as of March, the most recent data the federal government has released. Others -- it is unclear how many, because the state says it does not keep track -- buy essentially the same plans outside HealthCare.gov, going directly to insurers. They cannot receive subsidies but will be affected by the rate increases.\par \par \uc2 Dante Fierros of Tempe, who owns a small manufacturing business, blames the health law for the rising cost of insuring his 30 employees, although the connection, if any, is unclear. Like many of the law's opponents, he also considers it an example of government overreach. The turbulence in the Affordable Care Act marketplace here only solidified his support for Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 . ''I think it will help him,'' Mr. Fierros said of the rate hikes. ''It's kind of late, though.''\par \par \uc2 Hostility toward the health law is considerable here, but not overwhelming. A poll conducted this month by The Arizona Republic, the Morrison Institute for Public Policy and Cronkite News found that voters here remain divided on the Affordable Care Act, with 53 percent opposing and 40 percent supporting it. That is somewhat more negative than the national view, according to the latest \uc2 Kaiser Family Foundation\uc2  tracking poll, which found 45 percent of Americans opposing the law and 45 percent supporting it.\par \par \uc2 Mr. McCain has made the health law's troubles a centerpiece of his re-\uc2 election\uc2  campaign, attacking it for months now in ads and on the stump. It is a particularly potent issue with the Republican base, whose support he has sought to solidify after many voted for his primary opponent. He has hammered Ms. Kirkpatrick for voting for the law in 2010 and calling it her ''proudest moment'' in Congress, a claim she stood by in a debate on Oct. 10. Like Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , Ms. Kirkpatrick -- whom polls show trailing far behind Mr. McCain, a four-term incumbent and his party's presidential nominee in 2008 -- says the law needs to be fixed, not repealed.\par \par \uc2 Allen Gjersvig, who helps oversee Affordable Care Act enrollment efforts around the state, said he had been running the numbers and finding many plan holders might even spend less on premiums next year because subsidies were jumping along with rates.\par \par \uc2 ''What the headline or social media or your neighbor says may not be your reality,'' said Mr. Gjersvig, the director of navigator and enrollment services for the Arizona Association of Community Health Centers.\par \par \uc2 He added, however, that people in Maricopa County, which includes Phoenix, Scottsdale and Tempe, would have a narrower network of hospitals to choose from next year. The same goes for Pima County, home of Tucson, where \uc2 Blue Cross Blue Shield of Arizona\uc2  is selling only ''catastrophic'' plans through the marketplace next year, and only to people younger than 30. For everyone else, the only insurer will be \uc2 Health Net\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Kathy Hornbach, 60, a breast cancer survivor in the Tucson area, was certain the rate increases and insurer exits would not affect her, as she receives a generous subsidy and had heard \uc2 Blue Cross Blue Shield\uc2 , her current insurer, was staying in the marketplace in her county. Then she looked on HealthCare.gov.\par \par \uc2 ''Disaster!'' she wrote in an email, after learning \uc2 Blue Cross\uc2  would no longer cover people in her age group and her only option was a plan from \uc2 Health Net\uc2 . ''I know nothing about this company, they know nothing about this market, I have no idea how restricted their plan is, and there is no information available for me to review.''\par \par \uc2 On a brighter note, her monthly premium, now $195 after her subsidy, will drop to $79 while her subsidy more than doubles. Ms. Hornbach, while shaken, is a self-described liberal Democrat who will still vote for Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Find out what you need to know about the 2016 presidential race today, and get politics news updates via \uc2 Facebook\uc2  , \uc2 Twitter\uc2  and the First Draft newsletter .\par \par \uc2 Kathy Hornbach, 60, a breast cancer survivor in Tucson, learned Blue Cross would no longer cover people in her age group.

\par\par \uc2 AD OF THE WEEK\par \uc2 National Desk; SECTA\par \b \uc2 Actor's Voice Softens an Attack on \uc2 Trump\b0\par\par\uc2 By NICK CORASANITI \par \uc2 748 \uc2 words\par \uc2 30 October 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 18\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , looking to close her general \uc2 election\uc2  campaign against \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2  by establishing a strong contrast with her opponent, is out with a new ad titled ''Example,'' which highlights her experience and criticizes his temperament.\par \par \uc2 THE AD The voice is the actor \uc2 Morgan Freeman\uc2 's, but the theme, ''Our Children,'' is unmistakably that of Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's campaign. Scenes of children -- babies cooing, schoolchildren laughing on a bus, a woman helping a young boy with homework -- fill the frame. ''Now they're looking to see what kind of leaders we chose,'' Mr. Freeman says.\par \par \uc2 Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  is shown at the United Nations and described by Mr. Freeman as ''respected around the world.'' Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  is seen alone onstage, and called ''one who frightens our allies.'' Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  tours a factory, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  huddles with microphones around him. Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  stands stoically with military officers as secretary of state, ''the steady hand,'' as Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  sneers at reporters, ''a loose cannon.'' The ad dips into the past, showing Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  as first lady, smiling with children, and Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  mugging for the camera, slouched on slot machines.\par \par \uc2 ''A woman who spent her life helping children and families, or a man who spent his life helping himself,'' Mr. Freeman says as the ad winds down. It ends by returning to images of children and a final narration: ''Our children are looking to us. What example will we set? What kind of country will we be?''\par \par \uc2 THE MESSAGE: The ad makes the case that Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  has spent her career preparing for this moment while Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  has spent his enriching himself and is unfit to be president, because of both to his past record and his recent statements.\par \par \uc2 THE TAKEAWAY: The tone of the ad is more negative than in those candidates generally produce in the campaign's closing days, but it is softened somewhat by having Mr. Freeman, and not Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , deliver the attacks. It also seeks to reinforce what the \uc2 Clinton\uc2  campaign has been trying to convey as it courts both Democrats and Republicans-- that Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's campaign is all about himself and for his own ego, while Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's is about children and the future.\par \par \uc2 Changing channels ...\par \par \uc2 Microtargeting \uc2 Trump\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 Trump\uc2  campaign has yet to run a Spanish-language advertisement, but in sensing a new pocket of support among Indian-Americans, the candidate himself speaks Hindi, or at least tries to, in a new ad targeting them. ''Ab ki Baar \uc2 Trump\uc2  Sarkar,'' Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  says, although the ''Sarkar'' seems to be taken from another take. The ad is tracked by what sounds like traditional Indian music, but features so many clich\u233\'00\'E9s and shoddy graphics that many Indian-Americans initially took to social media wondering if it was a spoof.\par \par \uc2 Greatest Hits\par \par \uc2 Priorities USA calls it ''\uc2 Trump\uc2 's Symphony,'' but what follows is probably music to the ears only of Democratic political operatives and supporters. Over the course of 30 seconds, the primary ''super PAC'' supporting Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  seeks to cram in every caustic comment and controversial policy from Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's 17 months as a presidential candidate into one ad. From calling Mexicans ''rapists'' to his sexually aggressive comments, the ad closes with big white text on a black background: ''We can end this.''\par \par \uc2 Daisy Style\par \par \uc2 A new super PAC, formed by former Democratic Senator \uc2 Bill Bradley\uc2  and called the 52nd Street Fund, exploded onto the airwaves in Ohio, with an ad that opens with a split-second view of a mountainscape, before a flash and mushroom cloud eviscerate the vista as a narrator notes that a nuclear explosion ''could kill a million people.'' A news clip follows, of Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  being questioned about the use of nuclear weapons. The ad has the feel of the famed ''Daisy'' ad from 1964, which warned of the consequences of a Barry Goldwater presidency. That was intentional: The group announced during the week that its name was derived from a poem about World War II that President Lyndon Johnson read during the famed ''Daisy'' ad from 1964.\par \par \uc2 Numbers\par \par \uc2 $1.8 million: amount the \uc2 Clinton\uc2  campaign has reserved during the \uc2 election\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 $107 million: amount reserved by Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  and Priorities USA during the \uc2 election\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Find out what you need to know about the 2016 presidential race today, and get politics news updates via \uc2 Facebook\uc2 , \uc2 Twitter\uc2  and the First Draft newsletter.\par \par \uc2 Document NYTF000020161030ecau0004c\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Which is more important to your boss: to dominate people or to be liked by them?\par \par \uc2 Most leaders can be divided into these main two camps, says a management professor, and there is a time and a place for both styles.\par \par \uc2 ''Dominant leaders mandate a vision,'' said Prof. Jon K. Maner of the \uc2 Kellogg School of Management\uc2  at \uc2 Northwestern University\uc2 . Leaders whose main motivation is to be liked and admired -- he calls these prestige leaders -- ''facilitate their group's vision.''\par \par \uc2 Professor Maner is interested in how evolutionary biology shapes human behavior and creates social hierarchies. The dominant style of leadership evolved much earlier than the prestige style and is not restricted to humans, he noted.\par \par \uc2 ''You see dominance across many species, including many other primates,'' he said. ''In those species, the biggest and the strongest usually wins and ends up on top of the hierarchy.'' That isn't always the case with people. Sometimes being liked and admired helps propel a person to the top.\par \par \uc2 Professor Maner has analyzed leadership styles by administering questionnaires and by watching people interact in lab settings. He has found that dominant people exhibit behavior like speaking more often and more loudly, while prestige types spend more time listening and synthesizing other people's contributions.\par \par \uc2 ''Dominant leaders hoard information and ostracize talented group members. They closely monitor talented group members to make sure they don't get out of line, and they prevent their subordinates from forming close social bonds with one another,'' he said, drawing on research he has done with Charleen R. Case and with Nicole L. Mead.\par \par \uc2 Whereas dominant leaders want to be in control of everything, ''prestige is about leading in the domains in which you have expertise,'' Professor Maner said.\par \par \uc2 The presidential \uc2 election\uc2  offers up an example of the two styles: Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2  is a dominant leader, while \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  has more prestige-leaning qualities, Professor Maner said. \uc2 Steve Jobs\uc2  of Apple, who was known for his brash, uncompromising style, was a classic example of a dominant leader. Warren Buffett, who has a less forceful demeanor, falls into the prestige category, according to the professor's classifications.\par \par \uc2 The dominant style has a negative cast and can lead to damaging behavior like bullying. Over all, the prestige style tends to work better in our culture, he said.\par \par \uc2 But dominance is not always bad for an organization, he added. ''If you're running a company and you have a very strong vision for the direction the company needs to move, and your job as a leader is to get everybody aligned and moving toward that vision, then dominance actually works quite well.''\par \par \uc2 Dominance can also be effective in times of organizational crisis, he said. ''You want somebody to come in and lead the charge -- there isn't time for a big brainstorming session.''\par \par \uc2 The prestige leadership style is most effective when a leader does not have a strong vision and instead wants employees to come up with innovative and creative strategies, he said.\par \par \uc2 In a working paper that Professor Maner has written with Ms. Case, he details the way that the prestige style can get leaders into trouble. Because they gain their prestige by building relationships, they will sometimes make a popular decision over a wise one, he said, and ''they also have trouble giving negative feedback to employees.''\par \par \uc2 While most leaders tend to lean toward dominance or prestige, the best ones know how to use both styles -- and to deploy the right one at the right time for the good of their organization, Professor Maner said.\par \par \uc2 Twitter: @phylliskorkki\par \par \uc2 DRAWING (DRAWING BY MICHAEL WARAKSA) \par \par \uc2 Document NYTF000020161030ecau0004e\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 Style Desk; SECTST\par \b \uc2 Fast Times on the Campaign Trail\b0\par\par\uc2 By ASHLEY PARKER \par \uc2 1,564 \uc2 words\par \uc2 30 October 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 8\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 This month, a group of 20-somethings assembled in Des Moines to sustain themselves on gas station pizza; cover the Faith, Freedom, Family and Fudge Pops Forum; chase a long-shot presidential candidate who irons his own bluejeans; and huddle at a rotating cast of hotel bars each night.\par \par \uc2 But unlike their real-life counterparts, these campaign reporters (''embeds,'' in political parlance) were part of a fictional comedy set to debut in January with a six-episode run.\par \par \uc2 ''Embeds,'' which will be available on go90, \uc2 Verizon\uc2 's mobile streaming platform, is the brainchild of Scott Conroy and Peter Hamby, who met as young network political reporters in 2008 (Mr. Conroy for \uc2 CBS\uc2  and Mr. Hamby for \uc2 CNN\uc2 ).\par \par \uc2 At its core, the 30-minute show promises a coming-of-age tale set against the high-pressure backdrop of covering a presidential campaign, all through the eyes of sleep-addled, overly ambitious, sex-hungry reporters whose first job just happens to be helping to the determine the next leader of the free world.\par \par \uc2 Or, ''Five young reporters in way over their heads find themselves shaping the future of the country through raucous adventures in an unexpected world of sex, drugs and swing states on the presidential campaign trail,'' as the show's tag line puts it.\par \par \uc2 ''When it comes to embeds, it tends to be young people in their 20s, out on the road with long periods with just each other,'' said Megyn Kelly of Fox News, who is an executive producer of the series. ''There's a lot of alcohol, there's a lot of downtime, there's a lot of stress, there's a lot of fun, and there's this interesting cocktail of aphrodisiac ingredients that makes for a sort of charged dynamic in many ways.''\par \par \uc2 The average news consumer, she added, doesn't know just ''how salacious some of the behind-the-scenes stories can be.''\par \par \uc2 Mr. Conroy recently left his job at Vice News to focus full time on the show as an executive producer and writer, and Mr. Hamby is now head of news at Snapchat, and will not have a formal role on the show going forward.\par \par \uc2 But Mr. Conroy first had the idea for the show in 2010. The two men initially worked in Microsoft Word, and Mr. Conroy bought a book about how to make a television show, which helpfully advised, he recalled, ''Your show will never get made.''\par \par \uc2 The original conceit was focused on an unlikely candidate and his staff as they struggled to appeal to the peculiar mix of social and religious conservatives, as well as earnest farmers and anti-government renegades, who can determine a victory in the Iowa caucus.\par \par \uc2 ''At the time we sort of based it on \uc2 Chris Christie\uc2 ,'' Mr. Conroy said. ''We thought it would be funny if Christie ran for president and had to stump around Iowa.''\par \par \uc2 Mr. Conroy paused for a beat, then added with a giggle, ''Which, it turned out, was funny.''\par \par \uc2 Ultimately, the duo decided to write what they know. The show focuses on the five young television embeds (three men, two women), a slightly awkward and stilted Republican candidate (the fictional governor of Rhode Island, who certainly seems to resemble \uc2 Mitt Romney\uc2 ) and the candidate's Iowa and national press secretaries.\par \par \uc2 As for the (real-life) raucous adventures in sex, drugs and swing states, however? Upon learning about ''Embeds,'' Matt Nussbaum, a 24-year-old embed for \uc2 Politico\uc2  traveling the country with \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's running mate, \uc2 Gov. Mike Pence\uc2  of Indiana, said, ''My time on the trail has included swing states.''\par \par \uc2 And, indeed, this particular \uc2 election\uc2  cycle has often felt more like a grim, if surreal, slog (Did that \uc2 Trump\uc2  supporter just bare her teeth at me?) than an ecstatic, booze-fueled romp (Wheels up, rings off!).\par \par \uc2 In its own way, however, the 2016 \uc2 election\uc2  poses a separate set of challenges for the show: How to deliver compelling fiction when the reality playing out on \uc2 Twitter\uc2  and on television screens across the nation often already feels like a scripted political farce.\par \par \uc2 Ms. Kelly, for instance, has covered the \uc2 election\uc2  up close as her own network faced a scandal; Roger Ailes, the Fox News chairman, was forced to resign in the wake of a sexual harassment lawsuit, and began informally advising Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 ''I've said many times, if only people knew the real behind-the-scenes stories at any news organization, and not just Fox, let me make that clear, they would be shocked,'' Ms. Kelly said.\par \par \uc2 Instead, ''Embeds'' hopes to bring a knowing authenticity to the lives of young people, struggling earnestly and mightily, in situations they may not necessarily be equipped to handle. The show will flick at themes including what Mr. Conroy views as the ''fair'' criticism of the media and the Stockholm syndrome, to which young reporters sometimes succumb.\par \par \uc2 On the news media, Mr. Conroy said, ''Individual reporters are just trying to do their jobs and they're trying to do it really well and they're trying to inform the public,'' adding that, ''it's all the big decisions being made off the trail that disappoint people.''\par \par \uc2 On the quandary embedded reporters can face, Mr. Conroy said, ''You want to be a good journalist, and be antagonistic, but you also know that as soon as the candidate loses, you lose, too.''\par \par \uc2 Mike De Luca, who was a producer of ''Fifty Shades of Grey'' and ''The Social Network,'' and is an executive producer of ''Embeds,'' said he was struck by young reporters making such hefty decisions. ''I was a Gen X-er in the movie business, where the only consequence of a bad decision is the loss of money and a bad movie,'' he said. ''The ability to affect elections with the next tweet, it's a tremendous responsibility.''\par \par \uc2 Then there are the more quotidian details, like consuming only cookies for an entire day, or making rookie mistakes. For that, Mr. Conroy has been able to draw on his experiences. He recalled a moment early in 2007, when Mr. Romney approached \uc2 Barack Obama\uc2 , then a senator, at a Labor Day picnic in New Hampshire to say hello, the sort of footage that a television network would have loved to own four years later, when the two men battled each other for the White House.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Conroy dutifully shot it all. ''The problem,'' Mr. Conroy said, ''was I left the time stamp on my camera,'' covering over the meeting.\par \par \uc2 ''I sent the video back, and everyone was like, 'Are you kidding me?''' he said. ''I thought it wouldn't actually appear. I thought it was just in my viewfinder.''\par \par \uc2 And then, there is the sex. The pilot opens with the aftermath of a three-way sexual tryst involving an embed; the politerati are already buzzing about just which real-life reporter may have inspired the juicy scene. (Mr. Conroy says the opening love triangle is not based on any one person or incident.)\par \par \uc2 Ms. Kelly, asked if the threesome scene seemed plausible when she first read the script, laughed and said, ''I was never an embed nor ever in a threesome, so it wasn't that I could relate to anything in particular in that scene, but it did not strike me as impossible.''\par \par \uc2 Taylor Zakhar, a 24-year-old actor who plays one of the embeds, reached out to several campaign reporters, past and present, to learn more about the gig. ''What surprised me most with the actual embeds was they had personal lives and they had time for -- let's be real -- sex,'' Mr. Zakhar said.\par \par \uc2 Between waking up at 6 a.m., the three- and four-city days, editorial responsibilities and late nights at the hotel bar, Mr. Zakhar asked, just how did they fit in a romantic life? ''And they're like, 'Believe me, we fit it in,''' he said.\par \par \uc2 The show began shooting this month in Iowa, and Mr. Zakhar, who also prepared for his role by buying ''The Boys on the Bus,'' ''Fear and Loathing on the Campaign Trail '72'' and ''Politics for Dummies,'' said he already sees some similarities between the show's embeds and their real-life counterparts.\par \par \uc2 ''We're all staying in the same hotel, we have call times at 5 a.m., we're working until 7 p.m., then we're learning our six scenes for the next day, which is our version of sending our editorial notes into our desk,'' Mr. Zakhar said. ''So we're sort of living our versions of the embed life.''\par \par \uc2 So, has anyone started hooking up yet? ''No, no!'' the actor protested.\par \par \uc2 Then, like a good skeptical young embed, he added: ''Not that I know of. No one has hooked up yet that I know of.''\par \par \uc2 Continue following our fashion and lifestyle coverage on \uc2 Facebook\uc2  (Styles and Modern Love), \uc2 Twitter\uc2  (Styles, Fashion and Weddings) and \uc2 Instagram\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Clockwise from top, the director Danny Jelinek watches Alexis Zall perform on a monitor during filming of 'Embeds'; a pumpkin patch in Iowa is set for a scene that may seem all too familiar to actual reporters who have covered national political campaigns; Scott Conroy, second from right, is a creator and a producer of the show.

\par\par \b \uc2 1776: Would You Like to Reconsider?\b0\par\par\uc2 By Andrew Roberts   \par \uc2 1,938 \uc2 words\par \uc2 29 October 2016\par \uc2 The Wall Street Journal\par \uc2 J\par A9\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 The American primary system, which has thrown up two presidential candidates who are despised by 60% of Americans, is broken and urgently needs to be reformed. The only rational response to the choice of \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  or \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  is that of Henry Kissinger on the Iran-Iraq War: "A pity they both can't lose." For a non-American who defends the U.S. at every opportunity, I must ask: Are you deliberately trying to make it more difficult for me this year?\par \par \uc2 For all the undoubted genius of your Constitution, in 2016 it is no longer sustainable for Americans to say they have the best democratic system in the world. There have been many types of democracy -- the Athenian agora model of direct participation, the Westminster-based constitutional monarchy, the Swiss referendum and cantonal model, Indian mass democracy, and so on. But it is impossible any more to suggest that the finest one is that which has thrown up Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  and Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  as the final choice for 320 million Americans.\par \par \uc2 When Chinese GDP is overtaking America's, we are engaged in a vital ideological struggle over which political system delivers the best results: the state corporatism of the Beijing model, where there is no free speech and no democracy, or the democratic model of the West, whose leading democracy today presents its people with a choice between a preposterous, petulant monster of self-regard with deep, dark psychological flaws on one side, and on the other a proven failure whose views float with the polling data and whose word of honor cannot be relied upon.\par \par \uc2 I'm not for a moment suggesting that democracy is under threat in America. With your Constitution, Bill of Rights, First Amendment, Congress, separation of powers -- and the sublime instincts of the American people -- democracy is under no threat whatsoever here, for all your president's absurd hyperbole. But the concept of democratic values as worthy aspirations for modern society certainly is under serious threat globally from a totalitarian state-capitalist model that is dangerously attractive in what it is producing for its populations, while American democracy is offering a choice between a crook and a clown.\par \par \uc2 So what is to be done?\par \par \uc2 First, the Republicans need party leaders and candidates who confront people like Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  seriously from the start and do not coddle him in the vain hope that if you're nice you inherit his supporters when he collapses. Second, it is ludicrous to have debates controlled by TV channels that want the GOP to split and the Democrats to win, and which frame their questions accordingly.\par \par \uc2 Third, the talking down of America, even in an \uc2 election\uc2  year, has gone too far and is likely to be misinterpreted abroad. \uc2 Newt Gingrich\uc2  has said that if Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  wins, America will go the way of Venezuela. No it won't. When Adam Smith was brought the news of Burgoyne's surrender at Saratoga, and was told that Britain was ruined forever, he replied. "There's a great deal of ruin in a nation."\par \par \uc2 If we in Britain got over losing America and went on to become the largest empire in history, you can get over four years of Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 . The word "again" in "Make America great again" is a terrible libel on your country, which is still great on any objective criterion, albeit clearly going in the wrong direction. Self-pity is not a part of the American national character -- however emotionally and rhetorically alluring it might be during \uc2 election\uc2  time -- and you must not permit Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's sloganizing to allow it to find a place there.\par \par \uc2 Fourth, the percentages of support that guarantee a candidate a place in the debate should be drastically higher so that you don't have a dozen or more people taking part and thus sometimes given no more than 30 seconds in which to try to sum up complex issues, leading to a moronically low standard of debate. If Abraham Lincoln and Stephen Douglas were forced to debate each other in 30-second bursts, answering politically loaded questions from \uc2 CNN\uc2  and ABC and \uc2 CBS\uc2  intended to embarrass them, you probably wouldn't have got a much better outcome.\par \par \uc2 That \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  has held no public office also ought to have been an automatic disqualification. I know you like the idea in America that anyone can be president, but you are really testing that dictum this year. You've had plenty of presidential candidates who have not previously held elected office, including William Howard Taft, Herbert Hoover, Wendell Willkie and Dwight Eisenhower. But they all held high offices or served their country outside politics: Taft was governor of the Philippines, Hoover was head of the Belgian Relief Agency during World War I, Willkie fought the Ku Klux Klan and headed his local bar association, and Eisenhower was Supreme Allied Commander during World War II. These were all honorable positions of importance and responsibility. Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  has been head of Miss Universe and star of "The Apprentice," both businesses in which he owned an interest.\par \par \uc2 The Republican Party should not have allowed itself to be hijacked by a man with so minute a record of contribution to the nation, and it needs to alter its rules to prevent a similar demagogue with deep pockets and no conscience from doing it again. The Republicans need a superdelegate system of sane party elders who want to see the party win. If there hadn't been superdelegates in the Democratic Party, Bernie Sanders would be within a hair's breadth of the White House right now.\par \par \uc2 So my sixth reform is for the Republican Party machine to have the last say on who is or is not a Republican, and who can therefore stand under the Republican banner. It ought to demand a relatively longstanding commitment to the party. In October 1999, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  left the Republicans and in August 2001 he enrolled as a Democrat. In September 2009 he rejoined the Republicans. In December 2011 he wrote on his registration form, "I do not wish to enroll in a party." Then in April 2012 he rejoined the Republicans. If he doesn't walk, talk or think like a Republican, then the chances are he isn't one and shouldn't be allowed to stand as one.\par \par \uc2 Winston Churchill, after crossing the floor of the House of Commons for the second time, joked that, "Anyone can rat but it takes a certain amount of ingenuity to re-rat." What the Republican Party has moronically allowed Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  to do is to re-re-rat. That might have been understandable if he had been promoting traditional Republican policies and values, but he never has and is certainly not doing so now. Today he should have been a maverick third-party candidate ranting into the wind, instead of enjoying the formal imprimatur of one of the great political parties of the Western world.\par \par \uc2 Great presidential leadership has not been a prerequisite for American success. America threw up no truly great president in the 36 years between Lincoln's assassination in 1865 and Teddy Roosevelt's accession in 1901, but she threw up leaders aplenty. Those were also the years of America's greatest economic growth, and the leaders of that period weren't politicians, who had the sense to stand back from government interference. They were the great business leaders of those days, the Vanderbilts, Rockefellers, Morgans, Fricks and so on, who built the enterprises that allowed the U.S. to burst onto the world stage as the Great White Fleet circumnavigated the globe in 1909. But in the present era of anemic growth, we do need political leadership of an abnormally high order.\par \par \uc2 Can the ideals of 1776 still work in the modern world? I believe they can, indeed they are the best ones to cleave to. I've been rereading the Federalist Papers. Of course they are very good on how to prevent tyranny in the U.S. but for all they say about preventing vulgarity and corruption, the authors tended to assume that the people could be trusted to vote against vulgarity and corruption. They didn't foresee a situation when there is only a binary choice, between vulgarity on one side and corruption on the other. Madison's answer was that if people he called "fit characters" acted, then "It will be more difficult for unworthy candidates to practice."\par \par \uc2 Just because an idea is bad, it doesn't mean it can't last a long time -- look at Communism. Your primary system has only been around for 120 years -- almost exactly half the Republic's existence -- and is ripe for reform, not least because the leaders it has thrown up are not noticeably better than the ones from before the Progressives changed the voting rules. Luckily, the Constitution makes no mention of parties or primaries, so instead we may be guided by common sense in changing the way candidates are chosen.\par \par \uc2 Very often when someone says he's a candid friend, it's a precursor to him saying something rude and unpleasant. Well, I'm a candid friend of America who goes on TV and radio and writes books and articles in defense of America. So I hope you won't blame the messenger if I tell you straight that your selling point as a nation -- democracy -- is not cutting it in the modern world, largely because you are not selling it properly. With the one exception of female franchise in 1920 you haven't bothered to modernize it significantly since the Progressivist era of the 1890s.\par \par \uc2 If you really want government of, for and by the people to survive and prosper when you are no longer the largest income-generator on the planet, you are going to have to raise your game. It won't be done internally without a fight, because no politician ever genuinely thinks that a system that has had the perspicacity to put him there is broken.\par \par \uc2 But it's no longer enough for America to navel-gaze and worry about its president's gender or skin-pigmentation or even his ludicrous haircut. You need to look at what is happening to democracy globally. As a political system it's on trial, and right now it's losing across huge swaths of Asia and Africa -- losing out to the ideas of totalitarian state-directed corporatism that seems to be delivering much higher growth and much better leaders.\par \par \uc2 America needs to double down on the concepts that made her great and modernize the political system that gave her global hegemony in the first place. These abysmal presidential candidates are a depressing symptom of a larger problem with American politics -- but now you have four years to change the system. You owe it to the American people never again to give them such a putrid choice as the one they face the Tuesday after next.\par \par \uc2 ---\par \par \uc2 Mr. Roberts, a historian, is a professor of war studies at \uc2 King's College London\uc2  and the author of many books, including "Napoleon: A Life" (Viking, 2014).

\par\par \uc2 REVIEW & OUTLOOK (Editorial)\par \b \uc2 A Fine \uc2 FBI\uc2 -\uc2 Clinton\uc2  Mess\b0\par\par\uc2 848 \uc2 words\par \uc2 29 October 2016\par \uc2 The Wall Street Journal\par \uc2 J\par A10\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 Federal Bureau of Investigation Director James Comey revealed Friday that the \uc2 FBI\uc2  has reopened its investigation into \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's private email server and her handling of classified material, merely 11 days before \uc2 Election\uc2  Day. Mr. Comey cited new evidence, but the disclosure raises troubling new questions about the Democratic candidate and \uc2 FBI\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 In a letter to Congress, Mr. Comey wrote that in connection "with an unrelated case, the \uc2 FBI\uc2  has learned of the existence of emails that appear to be pertinent to the investigation." The \uc2 FBI\uc2  "cannot yet assess whether or not this material may be significant," but presumably the new emails are significant enough for Mr. Comey to conclude he had no choice but to take the extraordinary step of returning to the \uc2 Clinton\uc2  file so close to Nov. 8.\par \par \uc2 Liberals decided in real time Friday that Mr. Comey is now a partisan attempting to influence the \uc2 election\uc2 , but the same liberals had a ball after his July media appearance when he created a new legal standard of "extremely careless" instead of "grossly negligent" to exonerate Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 . Then the \uc2 FBI\uc2  chief was the reincarnation of Eliot Ness. At the third debate, Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  cited Mr. Comey's probity: "The \uc2 FBI\uc2  conducted a yearlong investigation into my emails. They concluded there was no case." Liberals can't have it both ways.\par \par \uc2 The reality is that Mr. Comey's \uc2 Clinton\uc2  probe has been a kid-glove exercise all along. Only days before he prematurely ended the investigation and proclaimed that "no reasonable prosecutor would bring such a case" -- a decision for the Justice Department, not the \uc2 FBI\uc2  -- \uc2 Bill \uc2 Clinton\uc2  met with Attorney General Loretta Lynch on an Phoenix airport tarmac.\par \par \uc2 When the \uc2 FBI\uc2  later released its investigation summary and interview notes on the Friday before Labor Day weekend, they showed Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  telling agents that she "could not recall" or "did not remember specifically" key details and events 27 times. The interview wasn't taped, and Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  wasn't put under oath, though it is a crime to lie to the \uc2 FBI\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Recent revelations include the immunity deals extended to \uc2 Clinton\uc2  aides \uc2 Cheryl Mills\uc2  and Heather Samuelson to get them to surrender their laptops. The \uc2 FBI\uc2  could have sought a subpoena or search warrant to do as much, but Justice didn't empanel a grand jury. Their deals specified that the laptops would be destroyed, meaning they can't now be re-searched and cross-checked against Mr. Comey's new information.\par \par \uc2 This week we learned that Virginia Governor \uc2 Terry McAuliffe\uc2  steered more than $675,000 to the political campaign of the wife of FBI deputy director Andrew McCabe, who oversaw the \uc2 Clinton\uc2  investigation in the \uc2 FBI\uc2 's Washington D.C. field office. Mr. McAuliffe is a longtime \uc2 Clinton\uc2  friend who is under \uc2 FBI\uc2  investigation himself over campaign finances.\par \par \uc2 News reports suggested late Friday that the "unrelated case" is an inquiry into disgraced former Congressman Anthony Weiner, whose wife is Hillary aide Huma Abedin. Perhaps the \uc2 FBI\uc2  discovered emails indicating contradictions with what the G-men were previously told. But whatever Mr. Comey has uncovered, he has an obligation to make it public before the \uc2 election\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Mr. Comey has now created an October surprise without anyone -- outside of the J. Edgar Hoover building or \uc2 Clinton\uc2  campaign -- knowing what the surprise is, and the new information is potentially relevant to how Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  would govern as President. The courtesies Mr. Comey has extended Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  would never have been afforded to a private citizen, and this has undermined public trust in his judgment and independence.\par \par \uc2 Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  could be entering the White House amid an ongoing ethics investigation, which may be a historical first. If Republicans hold Congress, investigations of the \uc2 FBI\uc2  investigation are a near-certainty, with agents sworn to tell the truth. Did Mr. Comey reopen the case because of internal dissent within the \uc2 FBI\uc2  about the probe and his apparent political favoritism? Or did he worry that a congressional probe might uncover new evidence if he didn't give the \uc2 FBI\uc2  a do-over?\par \par \uc2 Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  has herself to blame for this fiasco. Nobody forced her to use a private server, ignore warnings about classified material, and then stonewall when her conduct was exposed to voters. Even her advisers were privately shocked, or claimed to be. In a hacked \uc2 John Podesta\uc2  email from July 2015, Neera Tanden of the \uc2 Center for American Progress\uc2  vents: "Do we actually know who told Hillary she could use a private email? And has that person been drawn and quartered? Like [the] whole thing is [expletive] insane."\par \par \uc2 It may be insane, but it's also vintage \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  -- her preoccupation with secrecy, her recklessness, her lifelong conviction that she'll never be held accountable. The poor American electorate, already beleaguered enough by the \uc2 election\uc2  choice, must now factor James Comey's reprise into its decision.\par \par \uc2 (See related letters: "Letters to the Editor: Comey Has Achieved True, Bipartisan Wrath" -- WSJ Nov. 4, 2016)\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=wjco20161029000113"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document J000000020161029ecat00030\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 On Nov. 8 I will be going to the polls and voting, without hesitation or disinclination, for \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 . But what a treacherous and unforgivable act this will be for my father, who will no doubt be supporting the only presidential candidate he believes has any chance of saving the United States from almost certain ruin: Alyson Kennedy.\par \par \uc2 You have probably never heard of Alyson Kennedy until now, and neither have you heard of her running mate, Osborne Hart, unless you happen to be a member of the Socialist Workers Party, as my father has been for the past 50 years, or you happen to have passed in recent months a folding table on a city street and been handed campaign literature explaining that ''the only way forward is to organize independent working-class struggles that point toward overturning the dictatorship of capital.'' This is the exact sentiment, word for word, that my family subscribed to when I was growing up, a sentiment that can be traced all the way back to Marx, and that held great power over me as a child, and that holds some power over me still, but that seems to hold no power over almost anyone else, including the working class.\par \par \uc2 It's worth noting that Ms. Kennedy is a white woman, and Mr. Hart is a black man. But lest you think the Socialist Workers Party is opportunistically mimicking the Democratic Party, you should know that it has a long record of nominating women and nonwhite men for national office. Forty-four years before \uc2 Barack Obama\uc2 , there was Clifton DeBerry, and before Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , there was Linda Jenness in 1972. The party once even nominated a man born in a foreign country and a woman under the age of 35, running together on the same ticket, neither of whom, needless to say, would have been constitutionally eligible to assume office if they had somehow managed to get elected.\par \par \uc2 How many votes has any Socialist Workers Party candidate received? Sometimes a few thousand, sometimes tens of thousands, once 90,000, but that was 1976. No matter. The objective is not to amass votes but to participate in politics using whatever means the capitalist system has allowed so as to eventually be able to overthrow the capitalist system. To vote for a Socialist Workers Party candidate is not necessarily a ''protest vote,'' or at least not the kind we have come to associate with third-party candidates like \uc2 Gary Johnson\uc2  or Jill Stein, but rather it is a protest vote insofar as one's entire existence is a state of protest -- which was certainly true for my family.\par \par \uc2 What was also true for my family was that there was no delineation between our political outlook and our home life. We disapproved of America and thus took little interest in its popular culture, including television, music and fashion, leaving us with a severely limited understanding of the society we were hoping to change. We seldom celebrated holidays, we were impervious to advertising, and when the \uc2 Pittsburgh Steelers\uc2 , my hometown team, went to the Super Bowl, I was not permitted to watch.\par \par \uc2 Yet for a family -- and a political party -- so hermetically sealed off from American culture, we were certain that we had our finger on the pulse of the country, offering as certain inspiration to the average American citizen the paradigms of the Russian and Cuban revolutions. And when we were rebuffed by the average American citizen, which was often if not always, we felt validated, as it confirmed the purity of our ideas. But it never made us wonder if our methods, be they the Marxist rhetoric we employed or the candidates we nominated, were really used in the spirit of engagement.\par \par \uc2 A few weeks ago I was walking through Greenwich Village in Manhattan when I passed a folding table of a Communist organization, the name of which I did not catch, but which shared with the Socialist Workers Party the notion that the forthcoming \uc2 election\uc2  was a meaningless choice between ''the twin parties of capitalism and imperialism.'' Standing in front of the table was an elderly woman, about the same age as my parents, trying to appeal to the people on the street, none of whom seemed interested.\par \par \uc2 I realized I had been operating under the na\u239\'00\'EFve assumption that, given the stark contrast between Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  and \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , the broad Communist brush strokes would have been set aside, at least this time around. I also recalled a story from a friend who had grown up in the Jehovah's Witnesses, and who, years after he had left the group, had passed a woman selling its Watchtower magazine. Momentarily gripped by the damage that the privations of membership had wrought on his childhood, he had retaliated by approaching her and whispering, ''El diablo.''\par \par \uc2 Seeing the Communist woman on the street I did a remarkably similar thing. ''We have to vote for \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 ,'' I told her. There was a friendliness in my voice, but there was also a smugness. I was aware of the smugness, as I was aware of the earbuds I was fitting into my ears, and I knew that all of this -- including my ability to speak aloud without fear of ridicule -- was what it meant to belong to the mainstream.\par \par \uc2 The woman seemed to take it in stride. She gave a little smile and a shrug but didn't engage. I was not the first person who had made a comment like this, nor would I be the last. As a little boy, I often witnessed people mocking the noble ideas my family was offering. Now I had become that self-satisfied passer-by, and whatever fleeting gratification I might have derived from speaking to her this way was replaced, as I walked away, by an overwhelming sense of guilt and sadness.\par \par \uc2 She was an old woman, standing on a street among an indifferent populace, trying in her small way to make the world a better place. If there was any consolation for me, it was in the understanding that her goal in life was not really to resolve or rectify anything, but to remain forever on the outside.\par \par \uc2 Follow The \uc2 New York Times\uc2  Opinion section on \uc2 Facebook\uc2  and \uc2 Twitter\uc2  (@NYTopinion), and sign up for the Opinion Today newsletter.\par \par \uc2 Sa\u239\'00\'EFd Sayrafiezadeh is the author of the short-story collection ''Brief Encounters With the Enemy'' and the memoir ''When Skateboards Will Be Free.''\par \par \uc2 DRAWING (DRAWING BY GRACEY ZHANG) \par \par \uc2 Document NYTF000020161029ecat0005e\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

Mr. Schumer, who could become majority leader if the Senate goes Democratic this year, has a long list of accomplishments for New York. He championed a $60 billion disaster relief package that included billions for Hurricane Sandy victims. He helped set up the corporation to fund and manage the crucial Gateway rail tunnel between New York and New Jersey and pushed to restore $600 million in antiterrorism funds critical for the New York area. Ms. Long says she was inspired to run by Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 ; enough said.\par \par \uc2 THE HOUSE, FROM NEW YORK\par \par \uc2 In New York's First District, in eastern Long Island, Anna Throne-Holst, a Democrat who was Southampton town supervisor, is challenging the incumbent Republican, Lee Zeldin.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Zeldin has zealously pursued a narrow right-wing agenda poorly suited to his diverse district. He wants to defund \uc2 Planned Parenthood\uc2  and repeal the Affordable Care Act, among other terrible ideas. But his worst recent behavior has been in staunchly defending his party's unseemly presidential nominee, at one point suggesting that if Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  is racist, then President \uc2 Obama\uc2  is, too.\par \par \uc2 Ms. Throne-Holst avoids such divisiveness. She has worked well with Republicans locally and has promised to fight for gun control, climate-change legislation and vocational training for high-school graduates. She would be a thoughtful member of Congress, something this district now lacks.\par \par \uc2 Tom Suozzi, a Democrat, is running to succeed Representative Steve Israel in the Third District that cuts across Queens, Nassau and Suffolk Counties.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Suozzi, as county executive, saved Nassau from near bankruptcy. He has an impressive record fighting corruption, and he ran a lonely but principled campaign against Eliot Spitzer in 2006 for the gubernatorial nomination. He has been a national leader in the battle to limit urban sprawl and revitalize aging suburbs. He would be a strong, articulate advocate for his district and party.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Suozzi's opponent is a three-term Republican state senator, Jack Martins, a loyal party member in Albany who says he wants to promote Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's issues. That's bad news.\par \par \uc2 In the sprawling 19th District, in the Hudson Valley and Catskills, Zephyr Teachout, a Democrat, is running against John Faso, a Republican who was the Assembly minority leader. Ms. Teachout, a Fordham law professor and author, is an expert on political corruption and the corrosive influence of money in politics. She gained national attention as a political novice for her surprisingly potent bid to unseat \uc2 Gov. Andrew Cuomo\uc2  in the 2014 Democratic primary. Her campaign is focused on fighting corporate monopolies and dirty money, protecting the environment and cutting red tape for small businesses and farms. Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, a kindred spirit, has endorsed her.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Faso, well known and respected in this district, has a lifetime ''A'' rating from the \uc2 National Rifle Association\uc2 . He wants to support the local economy by speeding up environmental reviews of big projects and cutting corporate taxes. Mr. Faso says he disagrees with Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  on several issues but refuses to say whether or not he will vote for him. Ms. Teachout is the better candidate for this era of gridlock and disillusionment. She promises to be the strong voice for change in Washington that so many angry voters are demanding.\par \par \uc2 The race in the 24th District, in Syracuse and surrounding areas, pits a one-term Republican, John Katko, against Colleen Deacon, a Democrat and former aide to Senator Kirsten Gillibrand. Ms. Deacon has strong endorsements, including from President \uc2 Obama\uc2  and Emily's List. But Mr. Katko deserves re-\uc2 election\uc2 . He is a rare breed of Republican, an independent thinker who has bucked his party in crucial ways. He opposed its efforts to undo President \uc2 Obama\uc2 's administrative actions protecting young immigrants from deportation and its reckless campaign to destroy the Affordable Care Act. He acknowledges that climate change is real and caused by humans. Congressional Quarterly recently called him the eighth most independent House Republican.\par \par \uc2 He's wrong on some issues -- he tried to stall the funding of \uc2 Planned Parenthood\uc2 , stopped short of offering unauthorized immigrants a path to citizenship and opposed the nuclear deal with Iran. But -- and this is important -- he passes the \uc2 Trump\uc2  test; that is, he finds Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's remarks about women ''offensive, disgusting and inexcusable'' and says he won't vote for him. Asked by the Syracuse.com editorial board how he felt about being on the same ballot line as Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  and Ms. Long, Mr. Katko said, ''That's why God made Scotch.'' Washington needs more Republicans like him.\par \par \uc2 THE HOUSE, FROM NEW JERSEY\par \par \uc2 New Jersey's Fifth District, covering parts of Bergen, Passaic, Sussex and Warren Counties, has had the misfortune of being represented for nearly 14 years by a founding member of the ultraconservative, antigovernment Freedom Caucus, Scott Garrett. He voted recently against helping 9/11 first responders. He infuriated fellow Republicans by refusing to contribute to the National Republican Congressional Committee because it backed gay candidates. He opposes abortion rights and same-sex marriage.\par \par \uc2 His Democratic opponent, Josh Gottheimer, was a \uc2 Microsoft\uc2  executive and a speechwriter for President \uc2 Bill \uc2 Clinton\uc2 . He says he wants to work for more civility and productivity in Congress, for comprehensive tax reform, for better constituent services and for government investment in the district, something his opponent often rejects on ideological grounds. Mr. Gottheimer would serve the district far better than Mr. Garrett.\par \par \uc2 NEW YORK STATE SENATE\par \par \uc2 The Ninth District, in Nassau County, was dominated for years by Dean Skelos, the former Senate leader, and now a convicted felon and living symbol of all that is rotten in Albany. Todd Kaminsky, a Democratic member of the Assembly and a former prosecutor, won the seat in a special \uc2 election\uc2  this spring, narrowly beating a Republican lawyer, Chris McGrath. Mr. McGrath, who is running again, said he would oppose limits on outside income for legislators, a practice that too easily creates conflicts between public and private interests. We recommended Mr. Kaminsky in the special \uc2 election\uc2  and believe he should remain in that seat.\par \par \uc2 The Seventh District, also in Nassau County, is an open seat. Adam Haber, a school board member and businessman (real estate and restaurants), is the Democrat running against Elaine Phillips, the Republican mayor of the tiny village of Flower Hill. Both are worthy candidates, but Ms. Phillips gets extra credit for her environmental efforts, working after Hurricane Sandy to combat erosion and groundwater pollution and to protect the area from flooding. The \uc2 League of Conservation Voters\uc2  has endorsed Ms. Phillips, and so do we.\par \par \uc2 Follow The \uc2 New York Times\uc2  Opinion section on \uc2 Facebook\uc2  and \uc2 Twitter\uc2  (@NYTopinion), and sign up for the Opinion Today newsletter.\par \par \uc2 Document NYTF000020161029ecat0005d\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 Metropolitan Desk; SECT\par \b \uc2 Key Moments in the Downfall of Anthony Weiner\b0\par\par\uc2 By ELI ROSENBERG \par \uc2 555 \uc2 words\par \uc2 29 October 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 The New York Times on the Web\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 The revelation that the federal authorities had found a trove of emails related to their investigation into \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's private email server appear to be the latest fallout from an unlikely source: Anthony D. Weiner, a Democrat who once represented New York in Congress and also ran for mayor.\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 Federal Bureau of Investigation\uc2  has been investigating the contact by Mr. Weiner, whose political career collapsed a few years ago because of his online indiscretions, with a 15-year-old girl in North Carolina. On Friday, federal law enforcement officials said that emails related to the case involving Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  had been found on a computer belonging to Mr. Weiner, whose estranged wife, Huma Abedin, is a top aide to Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Here are key moments in Mr. Weiner's long fall from grace.\par \par \uc2 Resignation From Congress\par \par \uc2 Mr. Weiner's descent in the public's eye began in May 2011, when an explicit picture was sent out to the world from his \uc2 Twitter\uc2  account.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Weiner initially denied responsibility, saying he had been hacked. But the scandal refused to die, as details about lewd exchanges the congressman had conducted online with other women trickled out. On June 16, he announced his resignation from Congress at a news conference in Brooklyn.\par \par \uc2 ''I am here today to again apologize for the personal mistakes I have made and the embarrassment I have caused,'' he said.\par \par \uc2 Mayoral Run\par \par \uc2 Mr. Weiner announced that he would join the race to succeed Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg of New York in spring 2013, two years after his career had been all but written off.\par \par \uc2 There were some encouraging signs that Mr. Weiner might be on his way to a political resurrection. He rose steadily in the polls and was doing well with raising money early on.\par \par \uc2 But the emergence of additional explicit online messages forced him to admit that his habit of sending sexual images and text messages to female fans had continued for at least a year after he left Congress. Mr. Weiner stayed in the Democratic primary despite calls to drop out, but ended up receiving less than 5 percent of the vote.\par \par \uc2 Separation From Huma Abedin\par \par \uc2 Ms. Abedin said in August of this year that Mr. Weiner and she would separate after another revelation, this time in The New York Post, that he had continued to exchange illicit online messages with a woman. In the midst of a racy conversation with the woman, Mr. Weiner sent a photo of his crotch as he lay next to the couple's 4-year-old son. The New York City Administration for Children's Services opened an investigation into his treatment of the boy, Mr. Weiner later said.\par \par \uc2 Federal Investigation\par \par \uc2 Less than a month later, the federal authorities issued a subpoena for records in the wake of new allegations published in another tabloid, DailyMail.com, that Mr. Weiner had engaged in sexually explicit conversations with a 15-year-old girl in North Carolina.\par \par \uc2 Clinton\uc2  Email\par \par \uc2 The F.B.I. said on Friday that while investigating the illicit conversations Mr. Weiner had with the girl, it uncovered new emails related to the case involving Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , delivering a jolt to the presidential campaign just 11 days before the \uc2 election\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Document NYTF000020161029ecat00066\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Hillary Rodham gazed out the window of the beat-up '68 Buick rolling down Interstate 81, and saw spruce trees, the Blue Ridge Mountains and the life she'd left behind.\par \par \uc2 Ms. Rodham, then a 26-year-old lawyer, had just finished working on the Watergate committee and wanted to be with her boyfriend, \uc2 Bill \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , who was teaching law in Arkansas.\par \par \uc2 Her landlord, Sara Ehrman, who worried her bright young tenant was throwing away her future, offered to drive her down from Washington, and over the course of two days and 1,193 miles in August 1974, Mrs. Ehrman tried to talk Ms. Rodham out of her plan.\par \par \uc2 ''We'd drive along and I'd say, 'Hillary, for God's sake,' '' Mrs. Ehrman, now 97, recalled. ''He'll just be a country lawyer down there.''\par \par \uc2 Their journey had some of the ingredients of a classic American road trip -- a cheap motel, tchotchke purchases, encounters with drunken strangers and deeply personal conversations. Mrs. Ehrman, a strong-minded career woman who had scrapped her way to becoming a senior congressional aide years before the feminist movement of the 1960s, believed Ms. Rodham could do anything -- and could not believe that she was shelving her promising career for an uncertain future at \uc2 Bill \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's side in Fayetteville, Ark.\par \par \uc2 But each time Mrs. Ehrman would raise the issue, Ms. Rodham would politely respond: ''I love him, and I want to be with him.''\par \par \uc2 The trip 42 years ago offers a glimpse at a \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  the public seldom sees. She was not yet a self-assured lawyer, a powerful political wife or a tenacious presidential candidate, but a young woman, wide-eyed and eager, vulnerable and afraid, at the cusp of a momentous decision that would alter the course of her life.\par \par \uc2 And Mrs. Ehrman, then 55, had an unusually close-up view of the woman who would become the first female presidential nominee of a major party.\par \par \uc2 Young Hillary Rodham, Mrs. Ehrman recalled, was an intelligent, unstylish, hard-working woman, if an occasionally sloppy tenant, who had an infectious, throaty laugh and often failed to make her bed in the morning.\par \par \uc2 The two met in 1972: Mrs. Ehrman was working as co-director of issues and research for George McGovern's presidential campaign in Texas, and the \uc2 Democratic National Committee\uc2  had sent Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , a law student at the time, to help with voter registration.\par \par \uc2 ''A young girl walked in. She looked like 18 or 19,'' Mrs. Ehrman said of the first time she saw Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  at the campaign's headquarters in San Antonio. ''She had brown hair, brown glasses, brown top, brown skirt, brown shoes, brown visage, no makeup.''\par \par \uc2 They shared a cheap dinner at a Tex-Mex restaurant in downtown San Antonio and didn't speak again until 1973 when Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , then a Yale Law graduate, got a coveted job on the Watergate committee and called Mrs. Ehrman for advice on finding a place to live in Washington.\par \par \uc2 ''I said, 'The kids are gone, you can stay with me. No cooking,' '' Mrs. Ehrman recalled during a recent interview at her home in Washington. ''So she moved in with all her junk.''\par \par \uc2 Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's room in the four-bedroom house quickly took on the feel of a college dorm room, with piles of clothes (mostly brown), books and even a bicycle strewn about.\par \par \uc2 ''She had all her stuff on the floor,'' Mrs. Ehrman said. ''I just remember she didn't make her bed.'' (Years later, Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , who declined to be interviewed for this article, argued with Mrs. Ehrman that she did, in fact, make her bed.)\par \par \uc2 Mrs. Ehrman had a new job representing the Puerto Rican government, and she and Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  worked grueling hours. They would talk only occasionally in the rushed weekday mornings.\par \par \uc2 ''We'd get up, eat yogurt, maybe have coffee, get in my car, I'd drop her at the Watergate,'' Mrs. Ehrman said. ''She'd come home at 11, 12 o'clock at night, exhausted, eat yogurt, go to bed and do the same thing over again.''\par \par \uc2 The living arrangement lasted about a year until one day, when Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  told Mrs. Ehrman her plan: ''She said, 'I'm going to go down to Arkansas to be with my boyfriend.' ''\par \par \uc2 The word ''boyfriend'' looming in the air, Mrs. Ehrman reacted instinctively. ''It was at that point that I said, very delicately, 'You don't want to go there. You could get any job you want,' '' she recalled.\par \par \uc2 Then there was the matter of all that stuff.\par \par \uc2 Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  planned to take the bus to Fayetteville, where Mr. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  was teaching law and running for Congress. She was trying to figure out how to ship all of her clothes and books and bicycle. Watching this logistical spectacle unfold, Mrs. Ehrman said: ''Get in my car. I'll drive you down.''\par \par \uc2 So they piled her belongings into the back of Mrs. Ehrman's banged-up Buick, nicknamed ''Old Rattletrap,'' and began the drive, with Mrs. Ehrman determined to change Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's mind.\par \par \uc2 Her chances were slim. Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  had failed the Washington, D.C., bar exam, but passed the Arkansas test, confirming her decision to join Mr. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , she wrote in her 2003 memoir, ''Living History.''\par \par \uc2 They headed for Interstate 81, which parallels the Appalachian Mountains through Virginia and into Tennessee. Mrs. Ehrman remembered the talks the two women had as they drove past poor towns in southwestern Virginia and stopped briefly at the historic Barter Theater in Abingdon, Va., which got its name during the Great Depression, when most theatergoers could not pay the full ticket price.\par \par \uc2 They stopped in Laurel Bloomery, Tenn., a town known for its fiddler conventions, and bought pottery -- smooth ceramic dishes and mugs in earthy tones that both women still have. And in Memphis, they got stuck in a parade of inebriated Shriners who swarmed the streets in their distinctive hats.\par \par \uc2 The hotels were sold out in Memphis because of the Shriners convention, so they found a cheap motel just across the Mississippi River in Arkansas.\par \par \uc2 The women came from different backgrounds: Mrs. Ehrman was a secular Jew from Staten Island, Ms. Rodham a Methodist from Park Ridge, Ill.\par \par \uc2 But they talked, about life and careers and love, usually ending up in the same spot, with Mrs. Ehrman seeing talent and promise in Ms. Rodham, and little of the same in her boyfriend. ''Every 25 or 30 miles, I would say, 'Do you know what you're doing?' '' she said. ''He may never get a job. He can't make a living.''\par \par \uc2 Eager to start her new life, Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  didn't want to waste time, so the two women pulled in at drive-throughs or stopped at food stands and barbecue joints. ''I'm from Staten Island. We didn't eat ribs,'' Mrs. Ehrman said. ''We ate pie, a lot of pie -- pecan pie.''\par \par \uc2 Even as she urged her traveling companion to rethink her life plan, Mrs. Ehrman partly understood why the young woman was so smitten with \uc2 Bill \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , having briefly seen him herself on a tarmac in Waco, Tex., in 1972 when Mr. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  was also working on the McGovern campaign.\par \par \uc2 ''Standing at the foot of the steps of the plane was this drop-dead gorgeous young man in a white linen suit,'' Mrs. Ehrman said.\par \par \uc2 ''He was so beautiful, but young. He looked 21. And I said, 'Who's that kid down there at the foot of the steps?' And somebody said, 'He's the state director,' and I said, 'Obviously, we're not going to win Texas with a 21-year-old for a state director,' '' Mrs. Ehrman said. ''He doesn't like that story, but it's true.'' (Richard M. Nixon defeated Mr. McGovern in Texas by 33 percentage points, and it is unlikely that even the most seasoned state director could have reversed that result.)\par \par \uc2 After they made their way deeper into Arkansas, bypassing Little Rock and curving through the Ozarks, the women stopped at a ramshackle restaurant for lunch. Mrs. Ehrman was growing more alarmed as she took in the surroundings.\par \par \uc2 ''I said to her, 'Hillary, you're never going to get French bread here. You're never going to get Brie,' '' she recalled in a final plea, but by then Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  had made up her mind. ''She wasn't even listening to me at that point,'' Mrs. Ehrman said.\par \par \uc2 They arrived in Fayetteville, home of the \uc2 University of Arkansas\uc2 , on one of the rowdiest weekends of the year. The hilltop town, with its canopy of oak trees, had become a swarm of drunken football fans, their faces painted red and their heads covered with hats shaped like the university's hog mascot. The Razorbacks were playing a major rival at the time, the Longhorns of the University of Texas.\par \par \uc2 ''It was then that I broke down and cried when I thought, 'She's going to live here?' '' Mrs. Ehrman said. ''I just cried. I just absolutely cried.''\par \par \uc2 Mrs. Ehrman took a plane back to Washington and paid someone to drive her Buick home. ''I thought, 'I'm getting out of here tomorrow morning. I don't belong here,' '' she said.\par \par \uc2 She has thought of Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  often after that, she recalled, sighing. ''I certainly did think about her and feel, not that I had left her, but that her life had left her.''\par \par \uc2 When she dropped her off in Arkansas some 42 years ago, Mrs. Ehrman never dreamed that a young Hillary Rodham would be one \uc2 election\uc2  away from possibly becoming president herself. But, as the years went by, she came to see the wisdom of her young tenant's choices.\par \par \uc2 In 1992, Mrs. Ehrman went back to Arkansas, this time to the governor's mansion in Little Rock to help with Mr. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's presidential campaign.\par \par \uc2 On the day of his inauguration in 1993, Mrs. Ehrman even attended church with the Clintons. ''I was sitting there right against the railing and I saw her, head bowed and I said to myself, 'Jesus, she's really praying. She's a believer.' ''\par \par \uc2 In 2008, Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  and Mrs. Ehrman were reunited in Texas, this time for Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's own presidential campaign. And Mrs. Ehrman attended the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia in July to support Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 The passage of time has deepened Mrs. Ehrman's understanding of the love-struck young lawyer who stared out the Buick window.\par \par \uc2 ''Hillary is a very practical, pragmatic person,'' Mrs. Ehrman said. ''She wanted to be with him, but she also saw a future for him and herself.''\par \par \uc2 Find out what you need to know about the 2016 presidential race today, and get politics news updates via \uc2 Facebook\uc2 , \uc2 Twitter\uc2  and the First Draft newsletter.\par \par \uc2 Document NYTF000020161029ecat0005b\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

''My family has served this nation in uniform, going back to the Revolution. I'm a daughter of the American Revolution. I've bled for this nation,'' she said.\par \par \uc2 ''But I still want to be there in the Senate when the drums of war sound,'' she added. ''Families like mine are the ones that bleed first. But let's make sure the American people understand what we are engaging in, and let's hold our allies accountable, because we can't do it all.''\par \par \uc2 The moderator then turned to Mr. Kirk for a response. ''I had forgotten that your parents came all the way from Thailand to serve George Washington,'' he said.\par \par \uc2 When the exchange was broadcast and widely reported, critics accused Mr. Kirk of being disrespectful to his challenger.\par \par \uc2 Ms. Duckworth, who was injured when her Black Hawk helicopter was hit by a rocket-propelled grenade in 2004, was born in Bangkok to a Thai mother of Chinese descent. She grew up mostly in Southeast Asia, where her father, a Vietnam War veteran, worked for the United Nations and international companies. She has often told voters that members of her family have served in the United States military dating back to the nation's birth. Her husband, Bryan W. Bowlsbey, also served in the Iraq war.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Kirk, 57, a former Naval reservist who won \uc2 election\uc2  to the Senate in 2010, was already facing a tough campaign. In January 2012, he suffered a stroke that sidelined him for a year of surgery and rehabilitation. He uses a cane and sometimes a wheelchair, as he did at the Thursday night debate.\par \par \uc2 After the debate, Eleni Demertzis, a spokeswoman for the Kirk campaign, put out a statement that fell short of an apology. ''Senator Kirk has consistently called Rep. Duckworth a war hero and honors her family's service to this country,'' she said. ''But that's not what this debate was about. Rep. Duckworth lied about her legal troubles, was unable to defend her failures at the V.A. and then falsely attacked Senator Kirk over his record on supporting gay rights.''\par \par \uc2 Democrats condemned the comments.\par \par \uc2 Lara Sisselman, a spokeswoman for the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, said in an email on Friday morning that his comment ''was offensive, wrong, and racist.''\par \par \uc2 ''Senator Kirk has been caught lying about his military record over 10 times, but he was quick to launch false attacks questioning Congresswoman Duckworth's family's long history of serving our country,'' Ms. Sisselman said.\par \par \uc2 Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  weighed in on \uc2 Twitter\uc2  on Friday morning, saying she was ''thankful'' for the Duckworths' service to the country, adding to Mr. Kirk: ''It's really not hard to grasp.''\par \par \uc2 Thankful for @TammyforIL's--and her family's--service to this country. It's really not that hard to grasp, @MarkKirk. {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://t.co/rKY0rberiB"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 https://t.co/rKY0rberiB}}}\uc2  -- \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  (@HillaryClinton) October 28, 2016\par \par \uc2 Sincere apologies to an American hero, Tammy Duckworth, and gratitude for her family's service. #ilsen -- Mark Kirk (@MarkKirk) October 28, 2016\par \par \uc2 Democrats believe they are within striking distance of winning control of the Senate this year. Mr. Kirk is among at least a half-dozen Republican incumbents in the Senate who have tried to put distance between themselves and \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2 . Mr. Kirk even attacked the Republican nominee in a television ad.\par \par \uc2 On Thursday night, it was the \uc2 Trump\uc2  campaign's turn to be distant. The campaign manager, Kellyanne Conway, wrote on \uc2 Twitter\uc2 : ''The same Mark Kirk that unendorsed his party's presidential nominee and called him out in paid ads? Gotcha. Good luck.''\par \par \uc2 Senator Mark S. Kirk of Illinois appeared to mock Representative Tammy Duckworth's ethnicity in a debate Thursday night in Springfield.

\par\par \uc2 EDITORIAL\par \uc2 Editorial Desk; SECTA\par \b \uc2 Emails Again, Now With Mr. Weiner\b0\par\par\uc2 By THE EDITORIAL BOARD \par \uc2 578 \uc2 words\par \uc2 29 October 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 18\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Every time Americans start thinking nothing more can surprise them in this presidential campaign, something detonates to prove them wrong. So it was that on Friday, 11 days from \uc2 Election\uc2  Day, the F.B.I. director, James Comey, sent a cryptic letter to Congress saying, ''In connection with an unrelated case, the F.B.I. has learned of the existence of emails that appear pertinent'' to its investigation of \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's private email server.\par \par \uc2 Whose emails? About what? Do they have any connection to Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  herself? Mr. Comey wasn't saying. Indeed, he appeared to have no idea. He went on to inform Congress that the F.B.I. ''cannot yet assess whether or not this material may be significant,'' nor could he even predict how long it would take the F.B.I. to figure that out.\par \par \uc2 In a rare moment of bipartisan agreement -- if not mutual interest -- the campaigns of both Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  and \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  demanded, quite correctly, that Mr. Comey provide more information, and fast.\par \par \uc2 According to numerous reports on Friday evening, the new emails were discovered during the bureau's investigation of Anthony Weiner, the estranged husband of Huma Abedin, an aide and confidante of Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's. Mr. Weiner is being investigated in connection with illicit text messages he sent to a 15-year-old girl in North Carolina.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Comey clearly found himself in a bind. On July 5, he disclosed more than the F.B.I. typically does in an investigation, when he announced that the F.B.I. would recommend against the Department of Justice pursue charges against Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  for mishandling classified material through what he called her ''extremely careless'' use of a private server. That same week, he testified before Congress that his investigators had found insufficient evidence to warrant prosecution of Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 . The discovery of a new email trove presented him with a choice between risking opprobrium for not revealing its existence until after the \uc2 election\uc2  or delivering his deeply unsatisfying letter on Friday.\par \par \uc2 There is so far no indication that Mr. Comey's missive means the F.B.I. is ''reopening'' its investigation into Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , as hyperventilating Republicans, including Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , are suggesting, nor is it an acknowledgment that the F.B.I. erred in its earlier efforts. It doesn't mean that anybody within the F.B.I. is trying to influence the \uc2 election\uc2 , as some panicky Democrats are implying. But without more information, it's impossible for voters to judge the significance of this discovery as they head to the polls.\par \par \uc2 Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , as she has acknowledged, is responsible for this mess, which led Friday night to a gobsmacking headline on \uc2 CNN\uc2 : ''Weiner Sexting Probe Leads F.B.I. to Review \uc2 Clinton\uc2  Case.'' If she is elected, she will do well to recall that line should she ever consider being less than forthcoming. Her apparent effort to blunt scrutiny by means of that private server has only led to far more damaging scrutiny and suspicion, with no end in sight.\par \par \uc2 But Mr. Comey's failure to provide any specifics about a new, potentially important development, less than two weeks before \uc2 Election\uc2  Day, is confounding. As Mr. Comey put it in July, ''The American people deserve those details in a case of intense public interest.'' They deserve details even more urgently today.\par \par \uc2 DRAWING (DRAWING BY ARIEL DAVIS) \par \par \uc2 Document NYTF000020161029ecat0005c\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 National Desk; SECTA\par \b \uc2 Verdict in Siege Draws Surprise and Questions About Equity\b0\par\par\uc2 By KIRK JOHNSON, JULIE TURKEWITZ and RICHARD P\u201\'00\'C9REZ-PE\u209\'00\'D1A; Courtney Sherwood contributed reporting. \par \uc2 1,450 \uc2 words\par \uc2 29 October 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 10\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 It looked like an open-and-shut case.\par \par \uc2 Everybody knew that armed militia members led by Ammon Bundy and his brother, Ryan, had occupied a federal wildlife refuge in eastern Oregon starting on a bitterly cold day in January. The Bundys and their five co-defendants in Federal District Court in Portland never argued that they had taken over the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge buildings out of some mistake or accident. They knew full well, the defendants and their lawyers said, that the refuge was government property and that the government did not want them there.\par \par \uc2 But the jury, in a verdict on Thursday that surprised almost everyone, including the defendants and their lawyers, rejected the government's case entirely, voting unanimously to acquit all seven defendants.\par \par \uc2 ''I've done more federal trials than I can count and I've never won like this,'' said Matthew A. Schindler, a lawyer representing the defendant Kenneth Medenbach.\par \par \uc2 Though the exact reasoning of the jurors, who came from across Oregon and were never identified by name in court, remains unknown, most onlookers blamed prosecutorial overreach -- that the government stretched its case too far to fit the events at the refuge -- or stumbles in the presentation of evidence.\par \par \uc2 In an attempt to end the 41-day standoff, the government sent paid informants into the refuge, about 225 miles southeast of Portland. But the prosecution only grudgingly admitted as much during the trial, and the protester's lawyers used that fact to suggest that the government had something to hide, or had perhaps even induced occupiers into committing criminal acts.\par \par \uc2 The conspiracy charges leveled against the occupiers did not help either. Though often used for criminal enterprises -- like a plot to steal money or to sell illegal drugs -- conspiracy appeared to be a cloudier explanation for the occupation, which drew an array of people with grievances against Washington.\par \par \uc2 In an \uc2 election\uc2  year fraught with allegations that the system is rigged against everyday people, many antigovernment activists interpreted the verdict as a potent sign that they still have some voice and power.\par \par \uc2 ''Vindicated. World news. Let's take back the narrative America,'' was the message posted Friday morning on the Bundy Ranch Facebook page.\par \par \uc2 But people angry about the acquittals were also energized and speaking out -- with some saying that race had clouded the case. (All the occupiers were white.) And people involved in the case said the divisions would not be healed anyway.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Schindler, the lawyer, said in a telephone interview on Friday morning that he had just gotten off the phone with a caller who had threatened him. '''We're coming with guns to take adverse possession of your office,''' he quoted the caller as saying.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Schindler laughed it off, but he said he had no doubt that the repercussions of Thursday's verdicts were far from over.\par \par \uc2 During the occupation, the Bundys were cheered on -- both in person and online -- by members of the so-called Patriot Movement, a loose network of militia-type groups, who are deeply skeptical of federal power and sometimes attend protests armed with semiautomatic rifles. The government, militia group members say, is all powerful and out to take away rights and guns.\par \par \uc2 The paradox of Thursday's court verdict is that it delivered the exact opposite message. Supposed federal omnipotence and overreach became flat-footed haplessness in one brief, powerful court session, as the 12 jurors were polled about their conclusions, rejecting everything about the government's case.\par \par \uc2 The United States attorney for Oregon, Billy J. Williams, said in a statement on Thursday that prosecutors were disappointed with the outcome, but did not second guess the decision to bring the case to trial.\par \par \uc2 ''We strongly believe that this case needed to be brought before a court, publicly tried and decided by a jury,'' he said. A spokesman for Mr. Williams said on Friday that there would be no further comment or interviews.\par \par \uc2 Some people outraged by the verdict contrasted the acquittal to the way law enforcement officials and the courts have treated black people, and to Thursday's arrests of 141 people in North Dakota, many of them from the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe, who had been blocking a pipeline project.\par \par \uc2 ''Apparently it's legal in America for heavily armed white terrorists to invade Oregon,'' Montel Williams, a former talk show host, wrote on \uc2 Twitter\uc2 . ''Imagine if some black folk did this.''\par \par \uc2 Something is wrong when an armed #oregonstandoff faces no consequences & #NoDAPL protestors are attacked for protecting water. Unacceptable. -- Dr. Jill Stein (@DrJillStein) October 28, 2016\par \par \uc2 watch whiteness work #oregonstandoff {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://t.co/ENAts71Kpr"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 https://t.co/ENAts71Kpr}}}\uc2  -- deray mckesson (@deray) October 28, 2016\par \par \uc2 The acquittals drew cheers that were less widespread, but no less passionate, than the criticisms.\par \par \uc2 ''It gives some hope and some light to the people who are saying the country is lost,'' said B.J. Soper, 40, a leader of the Pacific Patriots Network, who spent about 36 days on the fringes of the occupation, saying that he was providing security for the occupiers. The verdict was a sign, he added, that government officials needed to listen to everyday people, unless they want to be put ''in harm's way.''\par \par \uc2 On Friday afternoon in Portland, several dozen Black Lives Matter protesters marched through downtown and blocked a street where some of the freed defendants had gathered near the courthouse for a celebratory hot-dog cookout with supporters.\par \par \uc2 As about 10 Portland police officers watched, some of the Black Lives Matters protesters burned an American flag, barely a quarter of a block from where the Malheur supporters had gathered with a half-dozen flags of their own on display. One man helping to burn the flag yelled, ''This is not a terrorist threat!'' A Malhuer supporter yelled back, ''I fought for that flag!''\par \par \uc2 Some passing motorists honked their horns, though it was unclear which side they were cheering.\par \par \uc2 The occupiers took control of the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge for 41 days starting just after New Year's Day, opposing both federal ownership of vast tracts of the West, and supporting a local ranching family, the Hammonds, who the occupiers said had been unfairly prosecuted. One occupation leader, LaVoy Finicum, was shot and killed -- and Ryan Bundy wounded -- in late January at a police roadblock during an arrest operation. The remaining occupiers held out for nearly three more weeks.\par \par \uc2 Whether Thursday's verdict might lead to more clashes, protests or occupations is unknown, but R. McGreggor Cawley, a political-science professor at the University of Wyoming who has studied and written widely about land protests in the West, said he doubted that it would. He noted that during the standoff, few people responded to Ammon Bundy's calls to join him and that the Bundy brothers and their father, Cliven, still face charges in a 2014 confrontation over the use of federal land in Nevada, where Cliven Bundy has a ranch.\par \par \uc2 ''We have a long tradition in this country of people resorting to protest politics, and all protest politics is the result of folks feeling that they are not getting a fair hearing from established institutions,'' Professor Cawley said. ''This is just the latest of a whole series of land disputes going back to the 'Sagebrush Rebellion' of the late '70s, early '80s.''\par \par \uc2 We the people have spoken against corruption in America it's time for democracy to rein! #Oregonstandoff {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://t.co/NKabEwFqyR"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 https://t.co/NKabEwFqyR}}}\uc2  -- Vets4Trump (@Vets_4_\uc2 Trump\uc2 ) October 28, 2016\par \par \uc2 How Thursday's verdicts might affect a second trial of Malheur occupiers, scheduled for February, is another uncertainty. Some defense lawyers representing Malheur occupiers said they believed the government might abandon that case, in which seven defendants are charged.\par \par \uc2 ''How can you have the leaders acquitted and still go forward?'' said Marcus R. Mumford, Ammon Bundy's lawyer, who was surrounded by federal marshals and arrested in the courtroom after Thursday's verdict. That came after Mr. Mumford vehemently protested that both Bundy brothers would continue to be held in federal custody while awaiting trial in Nevada next year. Mr. Mumford said he was cited for failure to comply with the lawful direction of a police office and impeding a federal officer.\par \par \uc2 For breaking news and in-depth reporting, follow @NYTNational on \uc2 Twitter\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 People gathered this week outside the federal courthouse in Portland, Ore., where the occupiers' case was tried. They included Kristen Thomas, left with a flag, and David Zion Brugger, right.

Maluma\par \par \uc2 [Video: Shakira - "Chantaje" (Audio) ft. Maluma Watch on \uc2 YouTube\uc2 .]\par \par \uc2 Shakira gets even more intense when she sings in Spanish, nervier and more committed, and her latest releases have been en espa\u241\'00\'F1ol. ''Chantaje'' (''Blackmail''), a close-knit duet with the singer and rapper Maluma, is the second single she has released with a fellow Colombian, following ''La Bicicleta,'' a duet with Carlos Vives. ''Chantaje'' is a sparse, insinuatingly catchy reggaet\u243\'00\'F3n battle of the sexes, with a hook built from a pitched-up vocal saying ''Hola, mira'' (''Hello, look''). He's not sure where he stands with her, and she's not exactly clearing things up: ''I'm a masochist,'' he moans, and she responds, ''With my body, an egotist.'' Later she adds, ''In this relationship, I'm in command.'' Of course she is. JON PARELES\par \par \uc2 YG, 'One Time Comin''\par \par \uc2 [Video: YG - "One Time Comin'" Watch on \uc2 YouTube\uc2 .]\par \par \uc2 Protest Rap Is Alive And Well, Part 1: In addition to being one of the rappers who's helped reinvigorate Los Angeles in the last few years, YG is also one of the bluntest political minds in hip-hop. His diatribe against Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  was the most effective agitpop of this \uc2 election\uc2  cycle, and he's made police brutality a frequent subject, as on the new single ''One Time Comin''': ''One time comin', gotta run from 'em/'Cause they might pull a gun on him.'' In the video, fictionalized dashcam footage of a police chase of a black man is interspersed with luxe shots of YG driving through the desert in a Rolls Royce pursued by police cruisers and helicopter. At the end, surrounded by cops, YG pulls out his cameraphone and his middle fingers and aims them at his adversaries, asking, ''You think you hard with your badge, huh?'' JON CARAMANICA\par \par \uc2 The Shins, 'Dead Alive'\par \par \uc2 [Video: The Shins - "Dead Alive" Watch on \uc2 YouTube\uc2 .]\par \par \uc2 So maybe it doesn't rise to the level of David S. Pumpkins, but ''Dead Alive,'' the new song by the Shins, strikes a fine balance of ghoulish and giddy. James Mercer, the band's frontman, shared a video for the song as ''a Halloween gift while you wait for the album,'' and most of the video is framed as a surrealist, ''Gulliver's Travels''-esque nightmare, complete with a bearded, guitar-strumming skeleton. The song has a chipper stomp and a liltingly sweet melody, especially in the chorus: ''So tonight, dance and cry/Dead alive.'' Mr. Mercer sings these words blithely -- paying no heed to the video's prophecy of his death, on March 7, 2056. NATE CHINEN\par \par \uc2 Kenny Chesney, 'Rich and Miserable'\par \par \uc2 [Video: Kenny Chesney - "Rich and Miserable" Watch on \uc2 YouTube\uc2 .]\par \par \uc2 Pre-\uc2 election\uc2  American malaise is even getting to a professionally easygoing singer like Kenny Chesney. ''Rich and Miserable,'' written by Jesse Frasure, Shane McAnally and Josh Osborne, is a long, long way from Mr. Chesney's typical arena-country ballads about rural pleasures and island getaways. The music is a midtempo rock march \u224\'00\'E0 la OneRepublic, while the lyrics are one long economic and spiritual plaint touching on fashion envy, student loan debt and endless work: ''Enough is never enough/American dream never wakes up,'' the chorus declares. There's no happy ending. J.P.\par \par \uc2 Vic Mensa, '16 Shots'\par \par \uc2 Protest Rap Is Alive And Well, Part 2: ''Ready for the war, we got our boots strapped'' is how the Chicago rapper Vic Mensa begins his acidic song ''16 Shots,'' the title a reference to the 2014 killing of Laquan McDonald by Chicago police. Some footage of that shooting is included in the video, but mostly the clip shows Mr. Mensa facing off with police officers who assault him with billy clubs, fire a Taser at him, and who shoot him repeatedly with handguns. It is a bracing, insistent, and potent clip, a dark complement to Mr. Mensa's lyrics capturing the frame of mind of an angry protester:\par \par \uc2 You can see it in they eyes, they wanna violate\par \par \uc2 Screaming out 'oink oink oink bang bang gang gang gang'\par \par \uc2 Murder murder murder they mindstate\par \par \uc2 I just made me a mil and still militant\par \par \uc2 JON CARAMANICA\par \par \uc2 Joanna Newsom, 'Make Hay'\par \par \uc2 [Video: Joanna Newsom "Make Hay" Watch on \uc2 YouTube\uc2 .]\par \par \uc2 There was bound to be more music from ''Divers,'' a fantastically ambitious song cycle by Joanna Newsom, and one of the most acclaimed albums of 2015. This week, on its one-year anniversary, she released ''Make Hay,'' a finished outtake with a twinkling backdrop of celeste, piano and Wurlitzer. Her lyrics dwell on a theme of mortality and human impermanence: ''So long,'' she sings at the song's outset, spinning the phrase as both a farewell to a friend and a nod to ''the accumulation of time and the passing of days.'' The song's title comes up metaphorically, as Ms. Newsom sings of tilling, raking and plowing, while the buzzards circle and the seasons turn. She ends on a note both grim and hopeful: ''We sow and we reap, again.'' N.C.\par \par \uc2 Run the Jewels, 'Talk To Me'\par \par \uc2 Protest Rap Is Alive And Well, Part 3: Run the Jewels, the duo of Killer Mike and El-P, recently announced the impending release of their third album of anarcho-rap, from which ''Talk To Me'' is the first single. Killer Mike, a sometime Bernie Sanders surrogate, raps about conspiracies and resistance and the desolation of American racism: ''Born black, that's dead on arrival/ My job is to fight for survival/In spite of these All Lives Matter-ass white folk.'' El-P follows with some rumbling tough talk and snide politically-themed jabs: ''Brave men didn't die face down in the Vietnam muck so I could not style on you.'' JON CARAMANICA\par \par \uc2 James Brandon Lewis, 'Say What'\par \par \uc2 James Brandon Lewis is a tenor saxophonist who made his first impression in the context of free jazz, with a sound recalling the burly, sanctified wail of Albert Ayler. But there's a groove-minded side to Mr. Lewis, and he pushes it to the forefront on an arresting new album, ''No Filter.'' The album features a trio with Luke Stewart on electric bass and Warren Trae Crudup III on drums, as well as guests like the rapper and producer P.SO the Earth Tone King. The opening track, ''Say What,'' finds Mr. Lewis more or less breathing flames over a ragged funk drone, sounding righteous and furious even after the tempo downshifts, four minutes in. N.C.\par \par \uc2 Pharrell, 'Runnin''\par \par \uc2 [Video: Pharrell Williams - "Runnin'" Watch on \uc2 YouTube\uc2 .]\par \par \uc2 Pharrell Williams has had some spectacular success with movie soundtracks, but it seems unlikely that his new single, ''Runnin','' will have the cultural impact of ''Happy.'' That's not to discount the merits of the song, a relaxed synth-gospel shuffle with lyrics about aspirations that run up against barriers of prejudice. The song echoes themes in ''Hidden Figures,'' a coming film about the team of African-American women whose scientific insights were crucial to the early \uc2 NASA\uc2  space missions. (He is one of the film's producers.) ''Don't act like you was there when you wasn't,'' Mr. Williams sings repeatedly, evoking hard historical realities from a place of privilege, but also gratitude.

SCHWARTZ \par \uc2 1,241 \uc2 words\par \uc2 29 October 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 2\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 The American economy moved into a higher gear last quarter, expanding at an annual rate of 2.9 percent and riding continued strength among consumers and a better performance in global trade.\par \par \uc2 The Commerce Department's report on the nation's gross domestic product, released Friday, is the next-to-last snapshot of the overall economy before voters go to the polls on Nov. 8. Americans will also get to gauge the economic fortunes of the nation from the monthly unemployment figures to be released on Nov. 4.\par \par \uc2 While the pace of economic growth in the third quarter fell well short of previous achievements, the latest data represented a significant improvement from the first half of 2016 and the best quarterly advance in two years. Economists also said the gains were probably strong enough to reassure \uc2 Federal Reserve\uc2  policy makers that it was safe to raise the benchmark interest rate when they meet in December.\par \par \uc2 ''This is a good, solid number,'' said Gus Faucher, deputy chief economist at PNC Financial Services in Pittsburgh. ''The economy is growing at a decent clip. Consumer spending will continue to lead growth, and the fundamentals there remain positive.''\par \par \uc2 For all the quarterly blips, the ups and downs on Wall Street and the back and forth between political parties, the American economy remains more or less on the same trajectory since the recovery began more than seven years ago: modest but consistent growth.\par \par \uc2 The bigger picture has remained remarkably steady, with yearly growth in the range of 1.75 percent to 2.75 percent. From 2010 to 2015, the economy grew at an average annual rate of 2.6 percent.\par \par \uc2 Economists like Michael Gapen of \uc2 Barclays\uc2  expect gross domestic product to expand 2.5 percent in the current fourth quarter, and then advance about 2 percent in 2017.\par \par \uc2 ''The consumer is fine, and there is evidence that the industrial side of the economy is stabilizing and the big drags from inventories and weak investment are abating,'' Mr. Gapen said. ''Manufacturing, trade and energy may no longer be significant headwinds, as they have been over the last year.''\par \par \uc2 The 1.1 percent growth rate from January to June this year was the slowest first half since 2011, and it was well below what economists expected when 2016 began.\par \par \uc2 Much of that weakness was a result of an inventory buildup on store shelves and in warehouses that has only slowly been worked off. The lingering effects on business investment from the collapse in the price of oil and other commodities have also dragged down the economy.\par \par \uc2 Many experts initially forecast another subdued performance in the third quarter, but estimates crept higher this week after a report on Wednesday showed better-than-expected exports and lower imports in September.\par \par \uc2 Unlike some recent periods, which showed uneven gains, the growth in the third quarter was broad-based, with most industries advancing. For the second quarter in a row, trade was a net positive, adding nearly a full point to growth on a big jump in exports.\par \par \uc2 Consumer spending slowed from its barnburner pace earlier in the second quarter, but at 2.1 percent, it was healthy enough to suggest that shoppers remained optimistic. Other sources of slack, like a drop in spending on residential construction, were more than made up by businesses as they restocked shelves and began investing again in the energy industry and elsewhere.\par \par \uc2 The comparatively good economic news was welcomed by \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's presidential campaign, which has repeatedly made the case that the economy is in better shape than \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  and other Republicans claim.\par \par \uc2 ''Today's G.D.P. release shows economic growth at its fastest pace in two years,'' Jacob Leibenluft, a senior policy adviser to Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , said in a statement. ''It's clear we've made real progress coming back from the crisis.''\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's campaign noted that growth during President Obama's time in office has fallen well short of 3 percent on an annual basis, and claimed that Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's stewardship of the economy would not be any better.\par \par \uc2 ''The growth numbers are catastrophic,'' Stephen Miller, a senior policy adviser to the \uc2 Trump\uc2  campaign, said in a statement. ''Hillary's tax, spend, borrow and regulate policies will cause an outright depression.''\par \par \uc2 In a separate report Friday, the \uc2 University of Michigan\uc2  revised its final reading on consumer sentiment in October down slightly to 87.2. Oxford Economics attributed the decline to the fierce rhetoric that has characterized the final days of the presidential race.\par \par \uc2 ''Consumers often feel less optimistic in \uc2 election\uc2  years, and 2016 is no exception,'' said Gregory Daco, head of United States macroeconomics at Oxford. ''We anticipate that a reasonably solid macroeconomic backdrop will underpin a rebound in sentiment once the \uc2 election\uc2  has concluded.''\par \par \uc2 The recent rebound in oil prices could also spur more economic activity among drillers and other energy producers in the months ahead, even if slightly higher gas prices won't please consumers.\par \par \uc2 Underscoring just how quirky economic data can be on a quarter-to-quarter basis, the Commerce Department noted that a big chunk of the export gains came from a surge in soybean exports that was unlikely to repeat itself in future quarters. Friday's release was the first of three estimates of quarterly growth that could be revised upward or downward by government number-crunchers; the next batch of data on G.D.P. is expected on Nov. 29.\par \par \uc2 Since joblessness hit a peak of 10 percent in 2009, the unemployment rate has been cut in half. Still, growth in the current recovery has fallen well short of previous rebounds in the 1980s and '90s.\par \par \uc2 The slack in the economy has contributed to paltry wage gains for most Americans until recently. In addition, plenty of workers are stuck on the sidelines or reluctantly working in part-time jobs because full-time positions are not available.\par \par \uc2 But now there are signs that wages are finally beginning to increase, as the steady drop in unemployment forces businesses to compete for new hires. With that in mind, the \uc2 Federal Reserve\uc2  is considered likely to raise interest rates when it meets in December; it would be the first increase in a year.\par \par \uc2 Policy makers at the Fed will gather next week, but most experts say there is little chance the central bank will act to tighten monetary policy so close to the presidential \uc2 election\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 While growth could rise above the 2 to 3 percent range for a quarter or two in the next year, it is unlikely to rise to the level last seen in the late 1990s, when economic activity was in the 3 to 4 percent range.\par \par \uc2 ''The labor force is growing more slowly than it was in the 1990s, and productivity growth is slower,'' Mr. Faucher of \uc2 PNC Financial\uc2  said. ''There are things we can do -- like improve the tax structure, implement regulatory reform and spend more on infrastructure -- but those are longer-term projects.''\par \par \uc2 Cargo containers being removed from a ship in the Port of Oakland.

\par\par \uc2 Metropolitan Desk; SECTA\par \b \uc2 New York Dramatists, Staging Revivals in a Year of \uc2 Trump\uc2 , Get Their Muse\b0\par\par\uc2 By COREY KILGANNON \par \uc2 1,306 \uc2 words\par \uc2 29 October 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 20\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 The volunteers worked busily in a campaign office for \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2  in Manhattan decorated with \uc2 Trump\uc2  posters and other campaign materials. One worker was reading Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's book ''The Art of the Deal.''\par \par \uc2 Over the next two hours, the candidate could heard bragging about his ''remarkably successful'' business career, complaining that his unpolished orations ''are held against me'' and that ''the press treats me like dirt.''\par \par \uc2 This was not a real \uc2 Trump\uc2  campaign office, but a church basement, and the campaign volunteers were actors in Lyra Theater's production of a 1941 play written in German with no script modifications but infused with modern touches culled from Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's campaign.\par \par \uc2 As the action unfolded onstage, there were audio clips of Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , and other campaign coverage, playing in the background, and some actors wore red baseball caps resembling Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's ''Make America Great Again'' hats.\par \par \uc2 The play, ''The Resistible Rise of Arturo Ui,'' was the playwright Bertolt Brecht's cautionary tale about the rise of Hitler.\par \par \uc2 It was not Brecht's best known play, but it has gained sudden popularity this \uc2 election\uc2  season with not just one but three downtown theater companies independently staging productions, all within a few blocks of one another in the East Village.\par \par \uc2 The companies see the Arturo Ui character -- a mobster and populist demagogue in Prohibition-era Chicago -- as strikingly similar to Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  and call their productions warnings against the prospect of a \uc2 Trump\uc2  presidency.\par \par \uc2 In fact, the \uc2 Trump\uc2  campaign has become a cultural muse of sorts, inspiring a flurry of work from New York's performing arts community, a sector of the city that traditionally votes Democratic.\par \par \uc2 Musical offerings around town playing off Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's candidacy include a Wagnerian opera, a violin concerto and another opera that echoes \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's bitter battle with Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 The Lyra ensemble decided to stage the play early on during Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's bid for the presidency, said Noam Shapiro, one of Lyra's artistic directors.\par \par \uc2 ''We all had same impulse: This is a play for our time,'' he said of the production, which runs through Nov. 5, at St. George's Episcopal Church on East 16th Street.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Shapiro said the parallels between Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  and the Arturo Ui character, a charismatic but dishonest outsider, were uncanny.\par \par \uc2 ''We didn't change a single word of text from the play,'' Mr. Shapiro said. ''We didn't have to.''\par \par \uc2 Arturo Ui is a gangster seeking control of the cauliflower market by killing competitors. He commandeers a political party and wins over the public as he rises to power and pits himself as the savior of Chicago who has cleaned up crime.\par \par \uc2 ''Arturo brags about his incredible success in business, or his love of the police, or how he hates immigrants,'' Mr. Shapiro said.\par \par \uc2 The theater companies have not conferred with one another, he said, but, ''in a way, all three productions are a team.''\par \par \uc2 ''We aren't working together,'' he continued, ''but we all share the same goal: speaking out against hate speech.''\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 Trump\uc2  campaign declined to discuss its role as creative inspiration.\par \par \uc2 A few blocks away on St. Marks Place, the Cave Theatre Company recently ended a two-week run of the play. Between scenes producers showed video clips of Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  and afterward played the Queen anthem ''We Are the Champions,'' which has been a staple at \uc2 Trump\uc2  rallies.\par \par \uc2 The Cave company used campaign-style promotional posters depicting a man in a \uc2 Trump\uc2 -like suit with a cauliflower in his lapel. One of their social media hashtags was #makecauliflowergreatagain.\par \par \uc2 Farther downtown, at the Wild Project, a theater on East Third Street, the Phoenix Theater Ensemble's version of the Brecht play runs through Nov. 13. A nearby Two Boots pizza franchise named a cauliflower-topped pizza after Arturo Ui and, as it happens, Sebastian Brecht, 53, a grandson of the playwright, is opening a handmade chocolate shop nearby.\par \par \uc2 In a vacated space in an office building on East 46th Street in Manhattan, a short satirical opera, ''The Drumf and the Rhinegold,'' is scheduled for Sunday and Monday, as part of an immersive installation that includes an inflatable pool.\par \par \uc2 The piece, a parody of Wagner's Ring Cycle, tells the story of Drumf, a sinister overlord who has stolen a magic ring granting world domination, but who runs into resistance from the Rhinemaidens -- Ivana, Marla and Melania -- who reclaim the gold ring hidden in his hair, which itself is a singing character.\par \par \uc2 The performance is a production of the Floating Tower theater company, and the opera's composer, Matti Kovler, said Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  ''has such a dramatic persona that is perfect for opera.''\par \par \uc2 On \uc2 election\uc2  night, ''\uc2 Trump\uc2  -- a Theatrical Concerto'' will be performed at Le Poisson Rouge on Bleecker Street.\par \par \uc2 The violin concerto is ''a 45-minute exploration into the mind of the Republican nominee,'' and will feature recorded snippets from \uc2 Trump\uc2  speeches played alongside a live chamber ensemble, said the piece's composer, Gene Pritsker.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Pritsker said his desire to write a piece about Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  grew as the candidate gained momentum, an ascent he called ''bad for people but good for my idea.''\par \par \uc2 Another musical production, a 2001 opera called ''Mrs. President,'' reflects the race between Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  and Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 The opera, scenes of which were scheduled to be performed on Friday night at the National Opera Center in Manhattan, is based on the story of Victoria Woodhull, the first woman to run for president, in 1872. She was fiercely criticized by a Brooklyn minister, Henry Ward Beecher.\par \par \uc2 ''He was kind of a \uc2 Trump\uc2 -like person, a bit of a bully who said all the right things,'' the composer, Victoria Bond, said.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Beecher labeled Ms. Woodhull as Satan and claimed she belonged in jail, while she criticized him over his infidelities. The vitriol is ''almost replaying itself'' in the current presidential race, said Ms. Bond, who added that the two candidates in the performance were made to look like their real-life counterparts.\par \par \uc2 Brecht, who fled Germany in 1933, shortly after Hitler became chancellor, wrote ''Arturo Ui'' in Finland before moving to the United States. The play has been performed twice on Broadway, including a production that opened in 1963 with Christopher Plummer. It was produced Off Broadway in 1991 with John Turturro playing Ui and in 2002 with Al Pacino in the lead role.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Shapiro, of Lyra Theater, said Brecht would be both ''horrified and delighted'' by the play's sudden resurgence.\par \par \uc2 ''He would be pleased that 'Arturo Ui' was getting produced, but saddened that the dangers he wrote about are so present in the United States today,'' he said.\par \par \uc2 The Cave company decided not to force the parallels. ''We didn't want to spoon-feed it to them, in that way,'' said James Masciovecchio, the production's director, especially because in the play, ''certain lines were almost scarily similar'' to Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's campaign rhetoric, including hard-line positions on immigration and law and order.\par \par \uc2 ''Instead of having our Ui be \uc2 Trump\uc2 , we let him be this crazy ridiculous character, and let the audience get it on their own,'' he said.\par \par \uc2 There are no direct references to Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  in the Phoenix production of the Brecht play. His estate, in granting performance rights, forbids amending the script, said Craig Smith, who plays Arturo Ui.\par \par \uc2 ''We didn't need to change a thing,'' Mr. Smith said. ''It's astonishingly relevant to 2016 without doing a thing to it.''\par \par \uc2 Matthew Van Gessel rehearsing the Lyra Theater's production of ''The Resistible Rise of Arturo Ui,'' a play about the rise of Hitler.

\par\par \uc2 Metropolitan Desk; SECTA\par \b \uc2 New Jersey House Race Becomes Political Brawl\b0\par\par\uc2 By WILLIAM NEUMAN \par \uc2 1,341 \uc2 words\par \uc2 29 October 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 17\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 RIDGEWOOD, N.J. -- With a barrage of negative ads and copious outside spending, the congressional race in a crescent of Norman Rockwell-style suburbs and tidy rural villages in northern New Jersey represents one of the region's most bare-knuckle political fights.\par \par \uc2 In one corner is the seven-term Republican incumbent, Representative Scott Garrett, a virtual Tea Partyer before there was a Tea Party and a founding member of the conservative Freedom Caucus, putting him far to the right of the kind of moderate Republican that has embodied the state.\par \par \uc2 In the other is his Democratic challenger, Josh Gottheimer, a former speechwriter and White House aide to President \uc2 Bill \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , who later worked as an executive for \uc2 Microsoft\uc2  and who styles himself a fiscal conservative and a liberal on social issues.\par \par \uc2 The Fifth Congressional District, extending across North Jersey from the Delaware River to the Hudson River, is the state's one potential swing district, with roughly the same number of voters registered in each party, making it a tempting target for Democrats hoping to cut into or even overcome the Republican majority in the House of Representatives in a topsy-turvy political year.\par \par \uc2 In the past, Mr. Garrett, who wields considerable influence as a member of the Financial Services Committee and the chairman of its Subcommittee on \uc2 Capital Markets\uc2 , has handily dispatched Democratic challengers, repelling their attacks on his conservative positions and mores.\par \par \uc2 But he has never faced a rival as well financed as Mr. Gottheimer, who has been helped by his deep connections within the \uc2 Clinton\uc2  circle and his experience in the corporate and technology worlds.\par \par \uc2 Through the end of September, Mr. Gottheimer had received contributions of almost $4 million, roughly double the nearly $1.9 million in contributions to Mr. Garrett's campaign.\par \par \uc2 And perhaps more than in other years, Mr. Garrett has provided plenty of ammunition to his opponent.\par \par \uc2 Last year, \uc2 Politico\uc2  reported that Mr. Garrett had irked fellow Republicans when he refused to pass on donations to the National Republican Congressional Committee because of its support for gay candidates.\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 New York Times\uc2  later reported that Mr. Garrett had also been part of a group of conservative Republicans who objected to the party's support for gay congressional candidates in 2014.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Garrett, a conservative Christian, is also a longtime opponent of same-sex marriage, and takes a strict stand against abortion.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Gottheimer has hammered him over those positions and a series of seemingly ideologically motivated votes in Congress, many of them reflecting a strong fiscal conservatism.\par \par \uc2 He points to, among others, Mr. Garrett's vote against an enormous spending bill that contained funding to assist emergency medical workers who fell ill after the Sept. 11 attack at the World Trade Center.\par \par \uc2 The charges have resonated and forced Mr. Garrett onto the defensive.\par \par \uc2 In a telephone interview, Mr. Garrett said that he supported assistance to the emergency medical workers but objected to other elements of the huge spending bill it was included in, leaving him the only member of the New Jersey delegation to vote against it.\par \par \uc2 And he called the reports that he had opposed gay candidates ''ridiculous.''\par \par \uc2 ''I support anyone's right to run for public office,'' he said. ''I support my fellow Republican candidates.''\par \par \uc2 He faulted Mr. Gottheimer for raising the issue, saying it distracted from other topics important to voters, including job creation, the economy and security issues.\par \par \uc2 ''This is something that came up over a year ago and my opponent has used it just to lie,'' Mr. Garrett said. ''This lie and other lies and they just continue to be spread, whether he advertises on TV or billboards or hires an airplane to spread his lies. It's really outrageous.''\par \par \uc2 Mr. Gottheimer said that his opponent's votes and positions are fair game.\par \par \uc2 ''The Tea Party extremism does not reflect the values of our district,'' Mr. Gottheimer said. ''If you want to get things done we've got to get rid of the obstructionists.''\par \par \uc2 Mr. Gottheimer has benefited from hefty spending by super PACs, fueled partly by reaction to Mr. Garrett's conservative positions. They include the Democratic Party-aligned House Majority PAC and the National Association of Realtors Political Action Committee. Mr. Garrett has pushed to end the federal government's role in supporting the mortgage market through \uc2 Fannie Mae\uc2  and \uc2 Freddie Mac\uc2 , the mortgage finance giants, a stand opposed by the Realtors group.\par \par \uc2 Voters have been bombarded by ads, mailings and campaign phone calls.\par \par \uc2 ''At least 50 percent of the time my phone rings it's something related to the \uc2 election\uc2 . Gottheimer. Garrett. And I get \uc2 Trump\uc2  calls all the time,'' said Karen Abraham, who was watching her two children play in a school playground in this suburb. Most of the television ads were negative, Ms. Abraham said, adding, ''It makes you glaze over after a while.''\par \par \uc2 The harshest salvo has come from Mr. Garrett, in a television ad that resurrects a 2007 lawsuit, filed by a woman in Washington, who claimed she was mistreated in the condominium building where she lived, and where Mr. Gottheimer was on the board.\par \par \uc2 The ad accuses Mr. Gottheimer of assaulting the woman, harassing her and forcing her to move.\par \par \uc2 Court papers and interviews with two of the lawyers involved in the case tell a different story. The lawsuit, which was eventually withdrawn without a settlement, describes an episode in the building's lobby in which Mr. Gottheimer allegedly raised his voice and wagged his finger in the woman's face, an encounter described as an ''assault.''\par \par \uc2 ''There was nothing to any of these allegations,'' said Richard F. Silber, a lawyer who represented another person named in the lawsuit. ''The allegations were that he wagged his finger at her. Who brings a lawsuit about that?''\par \par \uc2 The district is the only one in the state with relative parity between the two political parties. It has roughly the same number of registered Democrats and Republicans among voters, about 140,000 in each party, according to the New Jersey Division of Elections. About 216,000 registered voters in the district do not have a party affiliation. Here, as elsewhere, the outcome of the undercard may depend in part on how voters react to the bitter presidential contest between \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  and \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 While some Republican leaders have rejected Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , Mr. Garrett has not wavered; he has said he will vote for him, including after hearing Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's recorded statements about groping women's genitals.\par \par \uc2 ''As a father, as a husband, I said at the time that I'm outraged by the statements and disagree with him vehemently,'' Mr. Garrett said. ''At this point in time, though, we have to look at the issues and we cannot have a continuation of failed foreign policy and failed economic policy and that's what \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  will bring about.''\par \par \uc2 Mr. Gottheimer has received some surprising endorsements.\par \par \uc2 Meg Whitman\uc2 , a \uc2 Hewlett-Packard\uc2  executive and Republican fund-raiser who has been outspoken in her opposition to Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , endorsed Mr. Gottheimer. Ms. Whitman backed \uc2 Gov. Chris Christie\uc2  of New Jersey for president before he dropped out of the Republican nomination contest and endorsed Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Mr. Gottheimer has also received the endorsement of the New Jersey State Policemen's Benevolent Association, a response to Mr. Garrett's vote against the budget that included aid for World Trade Center emergency medical workers.\par \par \uc2 Mayor Harry Shortway of Vernon Township, a Republican, said that he had previously voted for Mr. Garrett, but that after meeting with both candidates he had decided to endorse Mr. Gottheimer, who seemed to him more responsive to the township's needs. It was turned down when it sought a federal grant to pay for a new fire truck, he said, and Mr. Gottheimer had pledged to help get the financing.\par \par \uc2 ''I don't see the federal tax dollars coming back into the area,'' Mr. Shortway said.\par \par \uc2 Josh Gottheimer; Scott Garrett \par \par \uc2 Document NYTF000020161029ecat0004u\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 National Desk; SECTA\par \b \uc2 Decision Pulls F.B.I.'s Leader Back Down Into Political Fray\b0\par\par\uc2 By ERIC LICHTBLAU, MICHAEL S. SCHMIDT and MATT APUZZO \par \uc2 1,311 \uc2 words\par \uc2 29 October 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 1\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 WASHINGTON -- James B. Comey, the F.B.I. director, faced a dilemma on Thursday when deputies briefed him about the discovery of a trove of emails that might be linked to the inquiry into \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's private email server that was closed months ago.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Comey could immediately inform Congress about the emails, which were found in an investigation into former Representative Anthony D. Weiner. That unusual step, months after Mr. Comey had cleared Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  of any criminal wrongdoing in the email case, would risk accusations that he was unfairly harming her presidential campaign less than two weeks before the \uc2 election\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Or he could delay any announcement and examine the new emails more closely, risking criticism that he had suppressed important new information if it came out after the \uc2 election\uc2 , despite his pledges of ''transparency'' in the investigation.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Comey, a Republican appointed by President Obama three years ago, decided that he could live with criticism of his judgment, aides said. So on Friday morning, the F.B.I.'s congressional liaison emailed a letter from the director to the chairmen and ranking members of eight congressional committees -- virtually ensuring that it would be quickly publicized by eager Republicans.\par \par \uc2 The reaction was swift and damning, with Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's supporters and even some Republicans blasting Mr. Comey. Indeed, Mr. Comey, who was attacked this summer by Democrats and Republicans for both his decision not to bring charges against Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  and for the way he handled it, found himself in an even stronger crossfire on Friday.\par \par \uc2 By late Friday, Mr. Comey felt it necessary to further explain his actions in an email to F.B.I. employees in which he acknowledged that ''there is significant risk of being misunderstood.'' He explained that he was trying to balance the obligation he felt to tell Congress that the investigation he had said was completed was continuing, with not knowing yet ''the significance of this newly discovered collection of emails.''\par \par \uc2 Across Pennsylvania Avenue from the F.B.I., Justice Department officials were said to be deeply upset about Mr. Comey's decision to go to Congress with the new information before it had been adequately investigated.\par \par \uc2 That decision, said several officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity, appeared to contradict longstanding Justice Department guidelines discouraging any actions close to an \uc2 election\uc2  that could influence the outcome.\par \par \uc2 One official complained that no one at the F.B.I. or the Justice Department is even certain yet whether any of the emails included national security material or was relevant to the investigation into whether Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  had mishandled classified material in her use of a private email server.\par \par \uc2 ''The F.B.I. has a history of extreme caution near \uc2 Election\uc2  Day so as not to influence the results,'' Senator \uc2 Dianne Feinstein\uc2 , Democrat of California, said in a statement. ''Today's break from that tradition is appalling.''\par \par \uc2 ''Was this information Congress needed to know urgently? Of course not,'' said Matthew Miller, a \uc2 Clinton\uc2  supporter who was the chief spokesman at the Justice Department under former Attorney General \uc2 Eric H. Holder Jr\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Some Republicans praised Mr. Comey on Friday for his integrity and independence in coming forward with the new information. But praise was largely drowned out by criticism, with even some of Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's biggest opponents upset at Mr. Comey's sudden re-emergence in what they said was a bungled case.\par \par \uc2 ''This is as bad for Comey as it is for Hillary,'' said \uc2 Tom Fitton\uc2 , the president of Judicial Watch, a conservative advocacy group that has successfully sued for access to thousands of Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's private emails.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Fitton said the cryptic nature of Mr. Comey's letter to Congress begged for an explanation of what new material the F.B.I. had found, whether it involved national security material relevant to the initial investigation, and why it was not found earlier.\par \par \uc2 ''This letter raises all sorts of questions that Comey and the F.B.I. should have to answer,'' Mr. Fitton said. ''They can't roll this out in the middle of a presidential campaign and just leave it at that.''\par \par \uc2 F.B.I. officials said Mr. Comey was well aware that his decision would draw fire from many sides. Mr. Comey -- who at 6-foot-8 is a dominating and charismatic figure -- has not shied from the public spotlight and has shown an independent streak throughout his career.\par \par \uc2 As deputy attorney general in the George W. Bush administration, he butted heads with top White House officials for his refusal to sign on to a \uc2 National Security Agency\uc2  surveillance program. And he clashed with Mr. Obama and other administration officials last year over what he saw as a ''Ferguson effect'' discouraging the police from actively pursuing suspects.\par \par \uc2 The investigation of Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  and her aides has been a major reason the bureau, more than at any time since at least the Watergate era, has been drawn uncomfortably into a presidential campaign.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Comey and his aides had hoped to put the \uc2 Clinton\uc2  email controversy behind them this summer, when he decided -- in unusually public fashion -- not to seek criminal charges against Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  or anyone else after a yearlong investigation.\par \par \uc2 But tensions have lingered, with Mr. Comey facing sharp second-guessing from Republicans on Capitol Hill and continuing questions from even his allies.\par \par \uc2 This month, when the moderator at a conference of police chiefs in San Diego asked him about the email controversy, Mr. Comey turned the question into a laugh line. ''I appreciate you bringing it up,'' he deadpanned. ''That's behind us. Nobody really cares anymore.'' The chiefs responded with knowing laughter.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Comey got so many calls from former agents and others after he decided this summer not to pursue charges that he had to change his phone number posted online. And at a recent meeting with retired agents, he was still fielding tough questions about the decision.\par \par \uc2 ''I have no patience for suggestions that we conducted ourselves as anything but what we are -- honest, competent, and independent,'' Mr. Comey wrote in a September email to employees. ''Those suggesting that we are 'political' or part of some 'fix' either don't know us, or they are full of baloney (and maybe some of both).''\par \par \uc2 But while the relentless Republican criticism of Mr. Comey's decision not to bring charges against Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  has received the most attention, both Democrats and Republicans have sought to help their presidential candidates, demanding investigations into their rivals one moment, then slamming Mr. Comey the next.\par \par \uc2 In recent months, the F.B.I. has dealt with the fallout from the email decision, wrestled with whether to pursue tips about the \uc2 Clinton\uc2  family foundation and opened a wide-ranging counterintelligence case into whether Russia is trying to influence the \uc2 election\uc2 . Just this week, the F.B.I. defended itself from accusations that Democrats had curried favor with the deputy director by making donations to his wife's failed State Senate campaign in Virginia.\par \par \uc2 F.B.I. agents say their community meetings invariably lead to questions about what the bureau is or is not doing in connection with the \uc2 election\uc2 . Mr. Comey has urged his agents to stay above the fray. But many of them worry that regardless of the \uc2 election\uc2 's outcome, the F.B.I. might end up the loser.\par \par \uc2 Follow The \uc2 New York Times\uc2 's politics and Washington coverage on \uc2 Facebook\uc2  and \uc2 Twitter\uc2 , and sign up for the First Draft politics newsletter.\par \par \uc2 James B. Comey, the F.B.I. director, preparing to testify on Capitol Hill last month. He said Friday that ''there is significant risk of being misunderstood.''

\par\par \uc2 Business/Financial Desk; SECTB\par \b \uc2 Wall St. Ends Lower on F.B.I. Inquiry\b0\par\par\uc2 By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS \par \uc2 827 \uc2 words\par \uc2 29 October 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 7\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 A stock market rally wilted in afternoon trading Friday after the F.B.I. notified Congress that it would investigate new emails linked to the Democratic presidential candidate \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 The market had started out on a strong note after the government reported that the economy broke out of a slump in the third quarter and grew at the fastest pace in two years.\par \par \uc2 The early climb was led by industrial, energy and technology companies, which would stand to benefit most from a pickup in economy. But the gains disappeared after the F.B.I. made its announcement. Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  has led in recent polls, and the surprise development added new uncertainty just a week and a half before the presidential \uc2 election\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 ''I think the betting has to be that there's nothing too damning, but we don't know,'' said \uc2 Brad McMillan\uc2 , chief investment officer for Commonwealth Financial Network.\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 Dow Jones\uc2  industrial average closed down 8.49 points, less than 0.1 percent, at 18,161.19. The index was 80 points higher shortly before the new inquiry was disclosed, then went down as much as 74 points in the minutes that followed.\par \par \uc2 The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index dipped 6.63 points, or 0.3 percent, to 2,126.41. The \uc2 Nasdaq\uc2  composite slid 25.87 points, or 0.5 percent, to 5,190.10.\par \par \uc2 Health care companies took the biggest losses by far. The prescription drug distributor \uc2 McKesson\uc2  plunged to a three-year low after its revenue fell about $1.5 billion short of estimates. The company slashed its annual outlook because of weaker drug prices, and investors worried that \uc2 McKesson\uc2  and its rivals would compete by making bigger cuts in prices.\par \par \uc2 McKesson\uc2  tumbled $36.39, or 22.7 percent, to $124.11. One of its competitors, \uc2 AmerisourceBergen\uc2 , lost $10.36, or 13 percent, to $69.14, while \uc2 Cardinal Health\uc2  shed $7.30, or 9.8 percent, to $67.50.\par \par \uc2 Drug makers were pummeled on weak earnings. \uc2 Amgen\uc2 , the world's largest biotech drug company, reported solid results for the third quarter and raised its guidance. However the company also disclosed flat sales of the anti-inflammatory medication Enbrel, its top-selling drug. Enbrel will soon face more competition, which could hurt sales.\par \par \uc2 Amgen\uc2  lost $15.39, or 9.6 percent, to $145.18. It was the stock's worst one-day loss since October 2000. The drug maker \uc2 AbbVie\uc2  reported weak sales and lost $3.86, or 6.3 percent, to $57.60.\par \par \uc2 Health care stocks are the worst-performing part of the market this year.\par \par \uc2 Earlier, stocks rose after the economy grew faster than expected during the third quarter. The Commerce Department said exports grew and more businesses restocked their shelves. In total, gross domestic product grew 2.9 percent, which was better than economists expected. Growth had slowed down late last year, causing worry among investors.\par \par \uc2 Mr. McMillan said he thought that the economy should keep growing at a similar pace for the next few quarters.\par \par \uc2 ''We're already seeing business and consumer confidence come back,'' he said.\par \par \uc2 General Electric\uc2  and the oil and gas drilling services company \uc2 Baker Hughes\uc2  rose as they discussed a possible deal. G.E. said the discussions concerned a partnership and that it did not intend to buy \uc2 Baker Hughes\uc2  outright. \uc2 Baker Hughes\uc2  tried to merge with a competitor, \uc2 Halliburton\uc2 , two years ago, but the companies walked away from the combination after the federal government sued to block it. G.E. added 59 cents, or 2.1 percent, to $29.22, and \uc2 Baker Hughes\uc2  gained $4.57, or 8.4 percent, to $59.12.\par \par \uc2 Other industrial stocks including \uc2 United Technologies\uc2 , which makes products including jet engines and elevators, and the manufacturer \uc2 Honeywell\uc2  also traded higher, adding 1 percent to close at $109.83. \uc2 United Technologies\uc2  rose 1.8 percent to $101.84.\par \par \uc2 Amazon sank after its profit came up short of analysts' estimates. The company also released a weak outlook. The stock is trading at record highs and has surged more than 30 percent over the last 12 months. It fell $42.04, or 5.1 percent, to $776.32.\par \par \uc2 AB InBev\uc2 , the world's largest beer maker, cut its annual revenue forecast after weak results from its business in Brazil. Its shares fell $4.62, or 3.8 percent, to $116.84.\par \par \uc2 United States crude oil fell $1.02, or 2.1 percent, to $48.70 a barrel in New York. That was its lowest price this month. Brent crude, the international standard, lost 76 cents, or 1.5 percent, to $49.71 a barrel in London.\par \par \uc2 Bond prices edged higher. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note remained unchanged at 1.85 percent.\par \par \uc2 CHART: The Dow Minute by Minute: Position of the Dow Jones industrial average at 1-minute intervals on Friday.

Schmidt, Matt Apuzzo and William K. Rashbaum contributed reporting from New York. \par \uc2 1,582 \uc2 words\par \uc2 29 October 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 1\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 WASHINGTON -- The presidential campaign was rocked on Friday after federal law enforcement officials said that emails pertinent to the closed investigation into \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's private email server were discovered on a computer belonging to Anthony D. Weiner, the estranged husband of a top \uc2 Clinton\uc2  aide.\par \par \uc2 In a letter to Congress, the F.B.I. director, James B. Comey, said the emails had surfaced in an unrelated case, which law enforcement officials said was an F.B.I. investigation into illicit text messages from Mr. Weiner to a 15-year-old girl in North Carolina. Mr. Weiner, a former Democratic congressman from New York, is married to Huma Abedin, the top aide.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Comey's letter said that the F.B.I. would review the emails to determine if they improperly contained classified information, which is tightly controlled by the government. Senior law enforcement officials said that it was unclear if any of the emails were from Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's private server. And while Mr. Comey said in his letter that the emails ''appear to be pertinent,'' the F.B.I. had not yet examined them.\par \par \uc2 By the end of a day that brought stinging criticism of Mr. Comey from both Democrats and Republicans, he appeared on the defensive, saying in an internal email to bureau employees that he had felt obligated to inform Congress, and ''we don't know the significance of this newly discovered collection of emails.''\par \par \uc2 The new development in the saga over Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's handling of classified information came months after the F.B.I. closed the investigation without charging Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 . The announcement, less than two weeks before the \uc2 election\uc2 , left Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's team furious and scrambling for explanations while bolstering the spirits of \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2  after a wave of controversies and Republican defections had led many to write him off.\par \par \uc2 ''We are calling on the F.B.I. to release all the information that it has,'' Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  said adamantly in an evening news conference that took issue with Mr. Comey for making the disclosure so close to the \uc2 election\uc2 . ''Let's get it out.''\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  was ebullient. ''Perhaps, finally, justice will be done,'' he declared at a campaign rally in New Hampshire.\par \par \uc2 A senior law enforcement official said that tens of thousands of emails belonging to Ms. Abedin were on Mr. Weiner's laptop, which the F.B.I. had obtained as part of its investigation into Mr. Weiner. About a month ago, a person familiar with the investigation said, F.B.I. agents seized the laptop as well as Mr. Weiner's iPad and cellphone.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Comey said in his letter to Congress that he did not know how long it would take to review the emails. Law enforcement officials said they did not know whether any were duplicates of emails discovered in the earlier investigation.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  has fallen behind Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  in most national polls and in many key states. Polls have been tightening in recent days, however, as Republicans have started returning to their party roots during the final stretch of the race.\par \par \uc2 An emboldened Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  seized on the F.B.I. action on Friday at his rally in New Hampshire. To cheers of ''lock her up'' from his supporters, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  said: ''\uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's corruption is on a scale we have never seen before. We must not let her take her criminal scheme into the Oval Office.''\par \par \uc2 After deriding the F.B.I. for weeks as inept and corrupt, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  went on to praise the law enforcement agency.\par \par \uc2 ''I have great respect for the fact that the F.B.I. and the D.O.J. are now willing to have the courage to right the horrible mistake that they made,'' Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  said, referring also to the Department of Justice. ''This was a grave miscarriage of justice that the American people fully understand. It is everybody's hope that it is about to be corrected.''\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 Clinton\uc2  campaign called on Mr. Comey to provide information beyond what was put forth in the letter.\par \par \uc2 ''Director Comey's letter refers to emails that have come to light in an unrelated case, but we have no idea what those emails are and the director himself notes they may not even be significant,'' said \uc2 John D. Podesta\uc2 , the chairman of Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's campaign.\par \par \uc2 He added: ''It is extraordinary that we would see something like this just 11 days out from a presidential \uc2 election\uc2 .''\par \par \uc2 Asked in an interview on \uc2 CNN\uc2  about Ms. Abedin's involvement, Brian Fallon, a spokesman for Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , demurred.\par \par \uc2 ''The facts of the matter is stuff that is unknown to us,'' Mr. Fallon said.\par \par \uc2 The ''October surprise'' confounded leading Democrats who suddenly found themselves on the defensive.\par \par \uc2 ''This is particularly troubling since so many questions are unanswered,'' said Senator \uc2 Dianne Feinstein\uc2 , Democrat of California. ''It's unclear whether these emails have already been reviewed or if Secretary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  sent or received them. In fact, we don't even know if the F.B.I. has these emails in its possession.''\par \par \uc2 Donna Brazile, the interim chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee, demanded more information from Mr. Comey about his next steps and expressed concern about the agency interfering with the \uc2 election\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 ''The F.B.I. has a solemn obligation to remain neutral in political matters -- even the faintest appearance of using the agency's power to influence our \uc2 election\uc2  is deeply troubling,'' Ms. Brazile said.\par \par \uc2 For Republicans who have struggled to defend Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  amid his comments about women and conspiracy theories about a rigged \uc2 election\uc2 , the opportunity to revisit a controversy that has dogged Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  was a welcome gift.\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 Republican National Committee\uc2  cheered the new attention on Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's emails as a potential turning point in the race.\par \par \uc2 ''The F.B.I.'s decision to reopen their criminal investigation into \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's secret email server just 11 days before the \uc2 election\uc2  shows how serious this discovery must be,'' said Reince Priebus, the Republican committee chairman, arguing that the Democratic nominee should be disqualified from seeking the presidency. ''This stunning development raises serious questions about what records may not have been turned over and why, and whether they show intent to violate the law.''\par \par \uc2 Speaker Paul D. Ryan, who has been critical of Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , assailed Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  and said that she should no longer be allowed to receive classified briefings.\par \par \uc2 ''\uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  has nobody but herself to blame,'' Mr. Ryan said in an emailed statement. ''She was entrusted with some of our nation's most important secrets, and she betrayed that trust by carelessly mishandling highly classified information.''\par \par \uc2 After defending her email practices for months, Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  sought to put the issue behind her this year, eventually apologizing and acknowledging that using a private server was a mistake. During the presidential debates with Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , she tried to avoid the subject and accused Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  of putting national security at risk by inviting Russian hackers to meddle in the \uc2 election\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  and her staff expressed relief in July when Mr. Comey announced that the F.B.I. had closed the investigation after determining that no one should face criminal charges. But he did criticize Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  and her aides for what he termed the ''extremely careless'' handling of sensitive information, leaving an opportunity for Republicans to continue hammering her for bad judgment.\par \par \uc2 The involvement of Ms. Abedin and Mr. Weiner in Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's case was an unforeseen twist. Several weeks ago, top Justice Department officials decided that prosecutors in Manhattan would handle Mr. Weiner's case. After seizing the devices, investigators have been combing them for information.\par \par \uc2 It remained unclear whether Mr. Comey would reveal more about the contents of the newly discovered emails. In his memo to the F.B.I. staff, it was evident that he is keenly aware of the fraught political backdrop that he faces.\par \par \uc2 ''We don't ordinarily tell Congress about ongoing investigations, but here I feel an obligation to do so given that I testified repeatedly in recent months that our investigation was completed,'' Mr. Comey wrote. ''I also think it would be misleading to the American people were we not to supplement the record.''\par \par \uc2 Ms. Abedin separated from Mr. Weiner in August after it emerged that he was exchanging lewd messages with a woman on social media. Such behavior had destroyed his congressional career and his 2013 mayoral campaign.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  has pointed to Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's association with the couple as an example of her bad judgment.\par \par \uc2 ''I only worry for the country in that \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  was careless and negligent in allowing Weiner to have such close proximity to highly classified information,'' Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  said in August. ''Who knows what he learned and who he told?''\par \par \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2  at a rally in Manchester, N.H., on Friday.

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Everything was looking up for \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 . She was riding high in the polls, even seeing an improvement on trustworthiness. She was sitting on $153 million in cash. At 12:37 p.m. Friday, her aides announced that she planned to campaign in Arizona, a state that a Democratic presidential candidate has carried only once since 1948.\par \par \uc2 Twenty minutes later, October delivered its latest big surprise.\par \par \uc2 The F.B.I. director's disclosure to Congress that agents would be reviewing a new trove of emails that appeared pertinent to its investigation into Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's private email server -- an investigation that had been declared closed -- set off a frantic and alarmed scramble inside Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's campaign and among her Democratic allies, while Republicans raced to seize the advantage.\par \par \uc2 In the kind of potential turnabout rarely if ever seen at this late stage of a presidential race, \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2  exulted in his good fortune. ''I think it's the biggest story since Watergate,'' he said in a brief interview, adding, ''I think this changes everything.''\par \par \uc2 He promised to batter Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  as a criminal in the race's final week and a half. And Republican House and Senate candidates gleefully demanded to know whether their Democratic opponents were sticking by Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Inside Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's campaign, advisers spent much of the day trying to gather information about which emails kept by her closest aide, Huma Abedin, could have attracted the F.B.I.'s new interest, and to respond effectively to neutralize any new threat from Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Late Friday, Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  herself said in Des Moines that the American people ''deserve to get the full and complete facts,'' demanding that the director of the F.B.I., James B. Comey, ''release all the information that it has.''\par \par \uc2 ''Even Director Comey noted that this new information may not be significant,'' Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  added. ''So let's get it out.''\par \par \uc2 With early voting well underway, and Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  already benefiting from Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's weekslong slide in the polls, Democrats' concerns were tempered -- more in the realm of apprehensiveness than panic.\par \par \uc2 ''We just don't know what this is all about, which is worrisome,'' said former Senator Tom Harkin of Iowa, a battleground state that voted for \uc2 Barack Obama\uc2  in 2008 and 2012, but where Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  has held a small lead in several recent surveys. ''We have to see what news comes in the next three or four days before we can say if this will make a real difference with voters.''\par \par \uc2 But Mr. Harkin and other Democrats, looking past \uc2 Election\uc2  Day, expressed concern about the potential impact on Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's ability to govern if she won the presidency while still under investigation.\par \par \uc2 ''I don't think there would be a constitutional crisis,'' Mr. Harkin said, ''but of course, you never know.''\par \par \uc2 In the final stretch of a turbulent campaign, the characteristically cautious Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  had finally begun to radiate self-assurance -- even ebullience -- as she made her closing arguments to voters. For the first time, she had seen a steady rise in the number of voters telling pollsters that they liked and trusted her.\par \par \uc2 As Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  faltered in the face of allegations of sexual assault and harassment, Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's campaign received encouraging reports from early voting and voter registrations. Her campaign ran advertisements in Republican-leaning states like Indiana, Missouri and Utah and even poured $2 million into Texas. She started to focus on aiding down-ballot candidates, looking beyond Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  to the Congress she hoped to work with as president. ''I don't even think about responding to him anymore,'' she told reporters last weekend.\par \par \uc2 But Friday's disclosure -- which concerned information gleaned from a computer belonging to Ms. Abedin's estranged husband, former Representative Anthony D. Weiner -- delivered a setback no one inside the \uc2 Clinton\uc2  campaign had anticipated. Ms. Abedin announced in August that she was separating from her husband, after years of his online sexual activity with other women.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Weiner had been an embarrassing nuisance for the \uc2 Clinton\uc2  campaign, but he now appears to pose a more serious problem.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  wasted no time exploiting the political opening, beginning an afternoon rally in Manchester, N.H., by invoking Mr. Comey's letter and using it to assail Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  as corrupt ''on a scale we have never seen before.'' He declared, ''We must not let her take her criminal scheme into the Oval Office.''\par \par \uc2 Having blasted Mr. Comey when he closed the investigation into Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's email server in July, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  seemed to imply that all was forgiven. ''I have great respect for the fact that the F.B.I. and the Department of Justice are now willing to have the courage to right the horrible mistake that they made,'' he said, adding, ''Perhaps finally justice will be done.''\par \par \uc2 Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's aides huddled at her headquarters in Brooklyn and on conference calls with her lawyers to decide how best to respond. Several donors privately contemplated the effectiveness of attacking Mr. Comey's integrity -- though the same Democrats had objected when Republicans accused Mr. Comey of partisanship when he recommended no charges against her.\par \par \uc2 John D. Podesta\uc2 , Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's campaign chairman, implored Mr. Comey to disclose additional details about the inquiry and said he was confident that the F.B.I. would reach the same conclusion it had over the summer.\par \par \uc2 ''It is extraordinary that we would see something like this just 11 days out from a presidential \uc2 election\uc2 ,'' Mr. Podesta said.\par \par \uc2 Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , in a brief news conference Friday evening in Des Moines, echoed those points and said that Mr. Comey had sent his letter only to House Republican committee chairmen -- though it was also sent to Democrats.\par \par \uc2 The thirst for more information was bipartisan: In a \uc2 Twitter\uc2  post, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's running mate, \uc2 Gov. Mike Pence\uc2  of Indiana, urged the F.B.I. to ''immediately release all the emails pertinent to their investigation.''\par \par \uc2 Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  and other Democrats expressed confidence that voters had already factored into their thinking all they needed to know about her use of private email as secretary of state.\par \par \uc2 Barney Frank\uc2 , a former Democratic congressman and a longtime \uc2 Clinton\uc2  ally, acknowledged that it was too soon to say whether the surfacing of a new trove of emails would damage Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's standing.\par \par \uc2 ''I'm inclined to think that people who have been angry about her email will continue to be angry,'' he said, ''and people who like and support her will continue to do so.''\par \par \uc2 Mr. Frank, like several other Democrats, also stressed that the F.B.I. had not signaled that it was rethinking the conclusions of its earlier investigation of Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  or even reopening it, but was assessing whether the new records contained information that was classified or relevant to that inquiry.\par \par \uc2 ''It sounds like Comey is being supercareful and superthorough,'' Mr. Frank said. ''He wanted to alert Congress quickly because he is being careful that nothing about these new emails would otherwise leak out. He usually wouldn't talk about things so early, but he wants to be careful.''\par \par \uc2 Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  has an enormous cash advantage -- $153 million in the bank for her campaign and joint fund-raising accounts as of last week, compared with $68 million for Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's campaign and joint accounts -- which means Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  has limited means to use the F.B.I. inquiry to damage Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  with television ads.\par \par \uc2 With more than six million Americans having already voted as of Monday, any efforts by Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  to claw his way back into contention could come too late. The \uc2 Clinton\uc2  campaign says its early voting turnout data points to a Democratic advantage in several swing states, including Florida, Colorado, Arizona and Iowa.\par \par \uc2 But the specter of an F.B.I. inquiry could cast a cloud over a victorious Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's administration-in-waiting. News had hardly spread when exasperated Democrats and donors were ruefully dredging up painful memories of the seemingly constant tug of congressional investigations on \uc2 Bill \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's White House.\par \par \uc2 Jim Manley, a Democratic strategist and former senior aide to the Senate minority leader, Harry Reid of Nevada, described his party's leaders as holding their collective breath to see what the F.B.I.'s review yielded. ''We'll have to wait and see how this plays out, but this is setting up a pretty dangerous dynamic,'' he said.\par \par \uc2 ''Republicans seem ready to investigate her for months and years to come,'' Mr. Manley said, hinting at more emails to come should congressional Republicans leak developments in the F.B.I. inquiry.\par \par \uc2 ''At the very least,'' he added, ''I'm not so sure how much of a honeymoon she is going to get now with this news.''\par \par \uc2 Find out what you need to know about the 2016 presidential race today, and get politics news updates via \uc2 Facebook\uc2 , \uc2 Twitter\uc2  and the First Draft newsletter.\par \par \uc2 A demonstrator outside a rally for Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2  on Friday in Manchester, N.H.

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 FORT MYERS, Fla. -- Sixteen. That's the number of times that Ellen Chrouch, a bird-loving Republican at the Shell Point Retirement Community here, has cast a vote for president, starting with Dwight D. Eisenhower in 1956 and, this year, a reluctant ballot for \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2 . During that time, America's political landscape has been turned inside out and upside down, and to hear many older voters tell it, is now marked only by low roads.\par \par \uc2 ''There was a time in my life when I really wanted to pick a good person for president, and he was there,'' Mrs. Chrouch, 80, who escaped Ohio's harsh winters 10 years ago, said with resignation and a touch of incredulity. ''I don't like either one of them,'' she said of this year's two presidential choices, ''so I fear for the future.''\par \par \uc2 Retirees are Florida's most coveted political demographic -- nationally, 72 percent of registered voters 65 and older turned out in the 2012 presidential race, and Florida has the nation's highest percentage of residents of that age. While they have plenty of company in being turned off by this \uc2 election\uc2 , conversations last week with retirees in and around two retirement villages, in West Palm Beach and Fort Myers, were a reminder that presidential politics has not always been this dispiriting. And the longer the memories, the worse this \uc2 election\uc2  can look.\par \par \uc2 ''This is the worst kind of \uc2 election\uc2  I have ever been through,'' said Pam Cesner, 70, another Republican transplant from Ohio, who sat sipping coffee outside a Fresh Market in Fort Myers with her husband, David, 73. ''I think there has always been, somewhat, this kind of mudslinging, but never to this extent.''\par \par \uc2 If the sour sentiments were common, they seemed most widespread among Republicans, who lamented that Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  was the party's nominee.\par \par \uc2 People 65 and older make up 19 percent of this swing state's residents. Thirty-three percent of the state's registered voters, with slightly more Republicans than Democrats, are 61 or older, according to Daniel A. Smith, an \uc2 election\uc2  expert at the \uc2 University of Florida\uc2 . And they are the residents most likely to vote, experts say.\par \par \uc2 Polls on people over 65 are often hard to gauge because of small sample sizes, but some recent national and state surveys show \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  either slightly ahead or close to even with Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  among older voters. This is a significant problem for Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  because older voters in recent elections have been reliably Republican. \uc2 Mitt Romney\uc2  beat President Obama by 12 percentage points among older adults nationwide in 2012. The margin in Florida was even wider. Yet, Mr. Romney failed to win. The last Democrat with a nationwide majority of the 65-and-over vote was Al Gore in 2000.\par \par \uc2 At the Shell Point Retirement Community and in pockets of Fort Myers, a largely Republican area on the Gulf Coast, the retirees talk of a country dangerously divided and of presidential debates that mimicked reality television. Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , they say, is cantankerous and coarse. Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , they add, is disingenuous and irksome. And the residents say they cannot trust either one.\par \par \uc2 ''We are both registered Republicans, and we both voted to assert our right to vote,'' said Mrs. Cesner, who arrived in Florida two years ago. ''We're sick to death of this, so we voted for the independent'' -- \uc2 Gary Johnson\uc2  -- ''then we still have the right to bitterly complain no matter who wins.''\par \par \uc2 If any \uc2 election\uc2  has tempted older voters to take a nostalgic plunge into past races, it is this one. These are people who once dressed up to go to the polls to cast their first votes for figures like Truman, Eisenhower and Kennedy. Their coming-of-age political era evoked buzzwords like dignity and civility.\par \par \uc2 ''Maybe it's the ethics, the manners, or respect, that's gone,'' said Lou Sahlmann, 89, a party-line Republican who sat carving an egret out of black walnut in Shell Point's wood-shop room. His first presidential vote, in 1948, went to Thomas E. Dewey, who lost to Harry S. Truman. (The Chicago Daily \uc2 Tribune\uc2  declared otherwise in its famous banner headline.)\par \par \uc2 President Ronald Reagan, he said, ''was a gentleman.''\par \par \uc2 This time, Mr. Sahlmann, a retired manufacturing executive who left Erie, Pa., for Florida 17 years ago, said he reluctantly chose Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 . ''It was a holding-my-nose vote,'' he said. Describing Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  as ''infantile,'' he paused to remove his glasses and set aside his egret. ''I hope it's not our democracy falling apart.''\par \par \uc2 No one could precisely say where the turning point took place, that moment when political campaigns seemed to plummet. Maybe it came with President \uc2 Bill \uc2 Clinton\uc2  and his affairs, or President George W. Bush and the Iraq war. Certainly, the media's 24-hour news cycle, its more polarized stances and the extreme push for ratings and clicks have contributed to the combustion, the retirees said.\par \par \uc2 Consider bipartisanship, several said. It was not so long ago, after all, that Republicans and Democrats could lean on each other to work out a deal and actually pass meaningful laws. Mr. Reagan sipped beers and shared a regular St. Patrick's Day lunch with the Democratic House speaker Tip O'Neill to hash out their differences. President Lyndon B. Johnson turned bipartisanship into a much-admired sport.\par \par \uc2 ''In the old days, Democrats and Republicans would have a martini and get things done,'' said Bob Daley, 81, who sat with his brother admiring the gulf view at Shell Point.\par \par \uc2 Or take sex scandals, they said. Plenty of presidents had extramarital sexual escapades, most famously Thomas Jefferson and John F. Kennedy. But they were viewed as private family matters, not as a chance to publicly forage ''in the gutter,'' as some here saw it, or conduct a public vivisection of a person's character. The media (overwhelmingly a men's club) famously shied away from these stories.\par \par \uc2 ''Presidents in the past had their lovers and mistresses,'' said Sandy Greene, a Democrat who grew up on New York's Upper West Side and now lives in Century Village in West Palm Beach, prime turf for Democrats. ''I love J.F.K. There were mistakes made all over. They all had skeletons. But there was dignity, and there seemed to be resolution. This is an embarrassment.''\par \par \uc2 Still, at 80, Mrs. Greene does not pine for the era -- her era -- when women were always expected to put dinner on the table, fetch coffee for their husbands and make do with domestic life. Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , she said, evokes the worst of that era when he talks about women.\par \par \uc2 ''I don't want my grandchildren to see and hear that,'' Mrs. Greene said. ''That was our place then; it isn't now.''\par \par \uc2 As Paul Gardy, 68, lay on a lounge chair by the Century Village pool soaking in the sun, the salsa-dancing New Yorker grimaced when asked about this \uc2 election\uc2 . He prefers Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , with his ''New York street smarts,'' to Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  and her ''dirty laundry.'' His vote, though, may go to neither. Meanwhile, there are distractions. ''Thank God there's sports on, is all I can say,'' he said.\par \par \uc2 Find out what you need to know about the 2016 presidential race today, and get politics news updates via \uc2 Facebook\uc2 , \uc2 Twitter\uc2  and the First Draft newsletter.\par \par \uc2 Early voters in Bradenton, Fla., this week. Nationally, 72 percent of registered voters 65 and older turned out in 2012. Florida has the highest percentage of residents that age.

That he refuses to do so proves that he will stop at nothing to reach his goal, regardless of the harm that may ensue.\par \par \uc2 It was my hope that he would lose this \uc2 election\uc2  and fade into the twilight. Now it appears that the vile stew of anger and fear that his campaign has brought forth will be with us long after the \uc2 election\uc2  is over, with alarming ramifications for the country.\par \par \uc2 GARY TONUCCI\par \par \uc2 Maplewood, N.J.\par \par \uc2 To the Editor:\par \par \uc2 Rarely have an overwrought headline and the use of inflammatory statements of a select few come together as they do in the article ''\uc2 Trump\uc2  Backers See Revolution if \uc2 Clinton\uc2  Wins.''\par \par \uc2 As the article says, the reporting is based on ''interviews with more than 50 \uc2 Trump\uc2  supporters at campaign events in six states'' -- a weak basis for an attention-grabbing article.\par \par \uc2 PAUL BORTZ\par \par \uc2 Denver\par \par \uc2 To the Editor:\par \par \uc2 Some of the followers of \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  are predicting a revolution or conflagration if he is not elected.\par \par \uc2 Queen Elizabeth I, England's monarch in the 16th century, vehemently condemned prophecy on the grounds that it could precipitate -- and might in fact be intended to precipitate -- the very events it foresaw.\par \par \uc2 HEATHER DUBROW\par \par \uc2 New York\par \par \uc2 Document NYTF000020161029ecat00039\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

Of course he is.\par \par \uc2 His letter to Congress on the reopened email investigation (nytimes.com, Oct. 28) drips with innuendo that again casts doubt on \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's veracity and innocence. Yet Mr. Comey admits in his letter that ''the F.B.I. cannot yet assess whether or not this material may be significant, and I cannot predict how long it will take us to complete this additional work.''\par \par \uc2 If that's the case, Mr. Comey, why not remain silent until you know the facts, as any responsible investigator would? Well, we do have one essential fact: that by releasing his letter 11 days before the \uc2 election\uc2 , the F.B.I. director is meddling in politics at Hooveresque levels.\par \par \uc2 PHILIP KIPPER\par \par \uc2 San Francisco\par \par \uc2 To the Editor:\par \par \uc2 So here's what it comes down to: Do we want a tight-lipped competent woman who made an uncharacteristic mistake using an email account, or do we want a loose-lipped incompetent man who characteristically tweets out venom without any thought of the consequences?\par \par \uc2 REED H.

Those who give may congratulate themselves on helping further the foundation's stated areas of concern: climate change, economic development, girls and women, global health.\par \par \uc2 Why should a foundation that helps such undeniably good causes be of any concern to voters? Because, of course, a mistaken minority of cynics assumes that those who donate to the foundation will in the future find influence with the Clintons.\par \par \uc2 Yes, foundations -- at least those, like the \uc2 Clinton\uc2  Foundation\uc2 , that are run in full accordance with I.R.S. regulations -- invariably acknowledge their donors, often meeting with them in person, but not providing them any favors in return.\par \par \uc2 A suggestion: What is to stop \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  from making a speech in which she reassures the public that none of the \uc2 Clinton\uc2  Foundation\uc2 's donors will receive any kind of special access or consideration during her potential presidency? She would then, of course, be bound to live by her words.\par \par \uc2 JOHN WILLENBECHER\par \par \uc2 New York\par \par \uc2 To the Editor:\par \par \uc2 Why do The Times and other major media outlets continue to report on the stolen \uc2 WikiLeaks\uc2  material?\par \par \uc2 If there were hacked emails pertaining to both candidates, there might well be a valid argument for publicizing them. But news coverage of private emails stolen from individuals with ties to only one candidate not only seems highly questionable, but also serves to assist an apparent attempt by Russian hackers to influence the presidential \uc2 election\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 FRED CANTOR\par \par \uc2 Westport, Conn.\par \par \uc2 Document NYTF000020161029ecat00036\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw272\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4080\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 U.S. stocks fell Friday, ending a week dominated by quarterly earnings reports.\par \par \uc2 The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite fell this past week, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average posted a slight gain. The losses coincided with a selloff in government bonds that pushed yields to their highest levels in five months.\par \par \uc2 The Dow industrials fell 8.49 points, or less than 0.1%, to 18161.19 on Friday, and the Nasdaq Composite lost 25.87 points, or 0.5%, to 5190.10.\par \par \uc2 Government bonds stabilized after two days of sharp price declines. The yield on 10-year \uc2 U.S. Treasury\uc2  note edged higher Friday to 1.847% -- its highest yield since May 27.\par \par \uc2 Stocks pulled back from earlier gains after the \uc2 Federal Bureau of Investigation\uc2  said it was reviewing new evidence in connection with its investigation of Democratic presidential candidate \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's email server.\par \par \uc2 Some of the initial selling was likely triggered by algorithmic trading platforms that analyze news headlines for certain words or phrases, mark them as negative or positive, and buy and sell stocks or bonds accordingly, some traders said.\par \par \uc2 The S&P 500 was up 0.2% shortly before the news, then quickly reversed those gains and ended down 6.63 points, or 0.3%, at 2126.41.\par \par \uc2 Gold for November delivery rose 0.6% to $1,275.50 an ounce.\par \par \uc2 Investors and traders have said the market is susceptible to shifts in expectations about who will win the U.S. presidential \uc2 election\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 "The next week before the \uc2 election\uc2  will keep the market on edge," said Kenny Polcari, director of equities at O'Neil Securities, adding that he expects more surprises that could swing stocks.\par \par \uc2 Earlier Friday, stocks were rising after the Commerce Department said gross domestic product expanded at an inflation- and seasonally adjusted 2.9% annual rate in the third quarter, exceeding the second quarter's pace of 1.4%.\par \par \uc2 But disappointing quarterly results from some U.S. companies pressured shares, capping a busy week of earnings. More than half of S&P 500 companies have reported so far.\par \par \uc2 McKesson\uc2  shares tumbled $36.39, or 23%, to $124.11 after the health-care giant on Thursday cut its profit outlook for the year. It was the lowest close for the stock since 2013, and its biggest one-day percentage decline since 1999.\par \par \uc2 Amgen\uc2  fell 15.39, or 9.6%, to 145.18 as the drugmaker reported Thursday a drop in sales of its cancer-care drug Neupogen, which started facing competition late last year.\par \par \uc2 Health-care stocks were the worst performers in the S&P 500, falling 2.2%.\par \par \uc2 The shares of \uc2 Amazon.com\uc2  dropped 42.04, or 5.1%, to 776.32 after the online retail giant late Thursday posted its lowest quarterly profit in a year. It was the stock's biggest one-day percentage decline since February.\par \par \uc2 In Europe, \uc2 Anheuser-Busch InBev\uc2 , the world's largest brewer, lowered its revenue forecast, sending its shares down 4.3%. The Stoxx Europe 600 slipped 0.3%, losing 1% for the week.\par \par \uc2 Japan's Nikkei Stock Average rose 0.6% Friday and 1.5% for the week.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=wjco20161029000164"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document J000000020161029ecat0004e\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw272\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4080\pichgoal600

\par\par \b \uc2 U.S. News: GDP Growth Hits Two-Year High of 2.9%\b0\par\par\uc2 By Eric Morath   \par \uc2 569 \uc2 words\par \uc2 29 October 2016\par \uc2 The Wall Street Journal\par \uc2 J\par A2\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 An acceleration in the U.S. economy in recent months should relieve fears about the economic expansion losing steam, but the third-quarter improvement does little to change the trajectory of a long but weak path for growth.\par \par \uc2 Gross domestic product, the broadest measure of U.S. output, advanced at a 2.9% inflation-adjusted annual rate in the third quarter, the Commerce Department said Friday. It was the strongest quarterly reading in two years after three straight quarters of sub-2% growth.\par \par \uc2 But underlying data showed slower gains in consumer spending, still-sluggish business investment and a housing sector subtracting from growth last quarter. The third-quarter acceleration largely reflected a buildup of business inventories and what could be a one-time jump in exports due to better soybean shipments.\par \par \uc2 "The reality is not as encouraging as the 2.9% headline," said Morgan Stanley chief U.S. economist Ellen Zentner. In the expansion's eighth year, "domestic factors in the economy are showing signs of slowing."\par \par \uc2 Both presidential campaigns were quick to seize on the last comprehensive look at the economy's health before the November \uc2 election\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Democratic nominee \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's campaign said the numbers show "real progress coming back from the crisis" but added "there is still more we need to do to build an economy that works for everyone."\par \par \uc2 GOP nominee \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2 's campaign called recent growth readings "dismal," saying the economy has "failed to deliver jobs, incomes, and opportunity." Since the recession ended in mid-2009, the economy has grown at a 2.1% annual rate, making the current expansion the weakest on records back to 1949.\par \par \uc2 While the end of the \uc2 election\uc2  cycle could ease some uncertainty about the path ahead, other questions are still hanging over the economy. At \uc2 Proto Labs Inc\uc2 ., a manufacturer in Maple Plain, Minn., specializing in 3-D printing, rapid sales growth slowed over the past year, particularly for clients tied to industrial equipment and commodities, said Chief Executive \uc2 Vicki Holt\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 "There's just some cautiousness that I feel in the environment," she said. "An increased number of customers tell us the reason they haven't bought yet is because projects have been delayed or canceled."\par \par \uc2 A key measure of business investment rose at a historically soft 1.2% rate. Firms increased spending on building structures but reduced outlays on equipment for the fourth straight quarter.\par \par \uc2 Consumer spending advanced at a 2.1% pace in the third quarter, half the rate of the prior quarter, but still a driver of growth.\par \par \uc2 The latest data suggests the economy this year isn't likely to top 2015's 2.6% growth rate, the best annual reading of the expansion. The economy has failed to grow at better than a 3% pace in any year since 2005, and the nonpartisan \uc2 Congressional Budget Office\uc2  projects GDP to grow at around 2% annually through 2026.\par \par \uc2 And while output advanced at a quicker rate last quarter, hiring was also stronger than in the second quarter. That could restrain improvement in worker productivity, which has fallen for three straight quarters through the middle of this year, and has been weak for much of the expansion. Productivity is a key ingredient in determining future growth in wages, prices and overall economic output.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=wjco20161029000159"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document J000000020161029ecat00049\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw272\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4080\pichgoal600

\par\par \b \uc2 FBI\uc2  Reopens \uc2 Clinton\uc2  Email Probe\b0\par\par\uc2 By Byron Tau and Devlin Barrett   \par \uc2 966 \uc2 words\par \uc2 29 October 2016\par \uc2 The Wall Street Journal\par \uc2 J\par A1\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 The discovery of new emails related to a closed investigation of Democratic candidate \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's email arrangement at the State Department became the latest surprise to hit this unpredictable presidential campaign on Friday.\par \par \uc2 The disclosure immediately roiled the campaign, as Republicans seized on it and Democrats expressed anger at the 11th-hour revelation, made in a letter from Federal Bureau of Investigation Director James Comey to congressional committee chairmen. Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , speaking to reporters, called on Mr. Comey to release more information about the emails immediately.\par \par \uc2 The emails were found during the search of a device in the \uc2 FBI\uc2  probe of former Rep. Anthony Weiner, who is being investigated for allegedly sending sexually explicit messages to a minor, a person familiar with the case said. Mr. Weiner is married to Huma Abedin, a senior aide of Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  who recently announced she and her husband were separating.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Comey's letter said the \uc2 FBI\uc2  was now reviewing the emails in connection with its investigation of the private server Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  used when she was secretary of state, a probe that the \uc2 FBI\uc2  had closed this summer. He wrote that the \uc2 FBI\uc2  had discovered emails in an unrelated case that "appear to be pertinent to the investigation" into whether Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  or her aides mishandled classified information.\par \par \uc2 Many of the emails were discovered on a laptop used by both Ms. Abedin and Mr. Weiner, according to people familiar with the matter. In searching the laptop, Investigators found thousands of emails, and they determined earlier this week that some involved Ms. Abedin discussing work issues. Ms. Abedin was questioned earlier this year by the \uc2 FBI\uc2  in the \uc2 Clinton\uc2  email probe.\par \par \uc2 Authorities haven't yet determined how many emails involved work, or if any of those included classified information, these people said. They also haven't determined if the work emails in question are copies of messages already reviewed by the \uc2 FBI\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Senior FBI officials decided that sitting on what they know would be a worse course of action than notifying Congress now while they undertake their investigation, these people said.\par \par \uc2 On Friday, Mr. Comey said it wasn't clear whether the new emails would be important to the probe. "The \uc2 FBI\uc2  cannot yet assess whether or not this material may be significant, and I cannot predict how long it will take us to complete this additional work," he wrote.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Comey recommended no charges against Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  or her aides when the investigation was closed this summer.\par \par \uc2 The announcement of a renewed probe into Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's handling of sensitive and classified information comes with just 11 days left in the increasingly bitter presidential contest between Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  and Republican opponent \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 On Friday, Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  took aim at Mr. Comey and said he should "release all the information he has." Speaking to reporters in Des Moines, Iowa, she added, "The American people deserve to get the full and complete facts immediately."\par \par \uc2 Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  noted that Mr. Comey wrote that the newly discovered emails might not be significant. She then said, "So let's get it out."\par \par \uc2 She also said she didn't believe the new emails would change the \uc2 FBI\uc2 's recommendation in July that no charges be brought against her. "I'm confident whatever they are will not change the conclusion reached in July," Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  said.\par \par \uc2 At a rally in Manchester, N.H., shortly after Mr. Comey's announcement, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  said: "I have great respect for the fact that the \uc2 FBI\uc2  and the Department of Justice are now willing to have the courage to right the horrible mistake that they made."\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 FBI\uc2  is part of the Justice Department, and both agencies declined to comment on the announcement on Friday.\par \par \uc2 The department has a longstanding policy that discourages investigators or prosecutors from taking overt investigative steps shortly before a primary or general \uc2 election\uc2 , in order to avoid the appearance of trying to sway the outcome.\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 FBI\uc2  made the decision to notify Congress about the newly discovered emails on its own, according to people familiar with the matter.\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 FBI\uc2  investigation into Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  was closed in early July, after an exhaustive forensic review of the private email server Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  used for all her government business. The probe also included interviews with the candidate herself and many of her staff members.\par \par \uc2 "Although we did not find clear evidence that Secretary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  or her colleagues intended to violate laws governing the handling of classified information, there is evidence that they were extremely careless in their handling of very sensitive, highly classified information," Mr. Comey said in an unusual press conference at the time.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Comey also said no reasonable prosecutor would have brought charges in the case, and that similar cases hadn't been brought in the past.\par \par \uc2 That led to an outcry from Republicans, including Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , who alleged that Mr. Comey was doing special favors for Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  because she was running for president. Mr. Comey rebutted these claims, telling the House Judiciary Committee in September that "you can call us wrong, but don't call us weasels."\par \par \uc2 Mr. Comey was a Bush administration appointee to the Justice Department and became FBI director under President \uc2 Barack Obama\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Republicans said Friday's developments renewed the debate about Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's judgment and her handling of secrets while serving as secretary of state between 2009 and 2013.\par \par \uc2 The latest twist in the long-running \uc2 Clinton\uc2  email saga comes at a point when at least 17 million people have already voted in the presidential race and the candidates are making their closing arguments.\par \par \uc2 ---\par \par \uc2 Beth Reinhard, Damian Paletta and Peter Nicholas contributed to this article.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=wjco20161029000155"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document J000000020161029ecat00045\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw272\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4080\pichgoal600

\par\par \b \uc2 Election\uc2  2016: Weiner's Troubles Bedevil Clintons\b0\par\par\uc2 By Erica Orden and Peter Nicholas   \par \uc2 568 \uc2 words\par \uc2 29 October 2016\par \uc2 The Wall Street Journal\par \uc2 J\par A4\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 Former U.S. Rep. Anthony Weiner is disrupting yet another high-profile career.\par \par \uc2 His history of exchanging sexually explicit text messages with women other than his wife, Huma Abedin, has repeatedly derailed his political aspirations.\par \par \uc2 More recently, it has attracted the attention of federal law enforcement, and on Friday it threatened to disrupt the campaign of Ms. Abedin's boss, \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , when the \uc2 FBI\uc2  said it was reopening a probe into Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's emails after searching a device belonging to Mr. Weiner.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Weiner didn't respond to a request for comment on Friday.\par \par \uc2 In 2011, Mr. Weiner, a Democrat who represented a swath of Brooklyn and Queens in the House of Representatives and was seen as a rising star in Democratic politics, resigned after admitting he exchanged lewd messages and photos online with multiple women.\par \par \uc2 Though he initially suggested his \uc2 Twitter\uc2  account had been hacked, after a picture of his crotch appeared on the social-messaging service, he later admitted that he had mistakenly shared the photo publicly, instead of sending it privately to a woman.\par \par \uc2 In 2013, Mr. Weiner attempted to revive his career with a bid for New York City mayor. For months, he flourished in the polls, but after a website published photos that he had evidently sent to another woman, his mayoral bid was doomed.\par \par \uc2 Still, Mr. Weiner attempted to revive his brand, occasionally showing up at New York city hall and attending the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia in July.\par \par \uc2 In September, Mr. Weiner faced a new setback. After the Daily Mail reported that he had exchanged sexually explicit messages and photos with a 15-year-old girl, he found himself being investigated by federal and local law-enforcement agencies.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Weiner has been part of the \uc2 Clinton\uc2  orbit for years, until his sexual misdeeds caused him to fall out of favor. As a congressman, he was a familiar presence at Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's campaign events when she first ran for president in 2008, part of a traveling entourage that also included Ms. Abedin.\par \par \uc2 She and Mr. Weiner married in 2010. Former president \uc2 Bill \uc2 Clinton\uc2  officiated at the ceremony, a gesture that seemed to showcase Mr. Weiner's status as part of the extended \uc2 Clinton\uc2  political family.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Weiner's sexting scandals, though, collided with Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's political ambitions. In the 2016 race, he has been largely invisible as Ms. Abedin crisscrosses the country.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Weiner's troubles are doubly embarrassing to the \uc2 Clinton\uc2  campaign: a reminder of \uc2 Bill \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's marital indiscretions but also a distraction to a candidate eager to stay on message.\par \par \uc2 Republican nominee \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  has questioned Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's judgment in relying so heavily on Ms. Abedin.\par \par \uc2 When the couple separated in August, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  released a statement saying that Ms. Abedin "was better off without him" and suggesting that Mr. Weiner had picked up "highly classified information" in the course of the marriage.\par \par \uc2 At times, Ms. Abedin has been caught up in an awkward dynamic as she served Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 . A film documentary chronicling Mr. Weiner's failed mayoral bid illustrated how Ms. Abedin navigated the two worlds. When Mr. Weiner cast his ballot, Ms. Abedin followed the advice of a longtime \uc2 Clinton\uc2  confidante and chose not to accompany him in public.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=wjco20161029000153"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document J000000020161029ecat00043\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw272\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4080\pichgoal600

\par\par \b \uc2 Election\uc2  2016: \uc2 FBI\uc2  Feels Political Heat From Both Sides\b0\par\par\uc2 By Naftali Bendavid   \par \uc2 593 \uc2 words\par \uc2 29 October 2016\par \uc2 The Wall Street Journal\par \uc2 J\par A4\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 Leaders of the \uc2 Federal Bureau of Investigation\uc2  consider it a point of pride and professional ethics to stay above the political fray, and they go to particular efforts to avoid explosive decisions shortly before an \uc2 election\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Yet the agency now finds itself at the center of a political firefight with FBI Director James Comey's letter to congressional leaders Friday announcing new steps in the investigation of \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's email arrangements while secretary of state. Democrats and Republicans seized on Mr. Comey's letter not only to attack each other, but the director himself.\par \par \uc2 Democrats criticized Mr. Comey for announcing the move so close to the \uc2 election\uc2 , especially with many questions unanswered, such as how significant the emails may be to the probe.\par \par \uc2 "It's too bad Director Comey didn't take those gaping holes into consideration when he decided to send this letter," said \uc2 Sen. Dianne Feinstein\uc2  (D., Calif.), the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee. "The \uc2 FBI\uc2  has a history of extreme caution near \uc2 Election\uc2  Day so as not to influence the results," she said. "Today's break from that tradition is appalling."\par \par \uc2 Republicans remained frustrated that the \uc2 FBI\uc2  had recommended against charging Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  in the first place. Many reiterated their belief that the probe had been bungled.\par \par \uc2 "I have serious questions about the way the \uc2 FBI\uc2  has handled this case up to now," said Sen. Roy Blunt (R., Mo.), also an Intelligence Committee member.\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 FBI\uc2  declined to comment for this article.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Comey has taken an unorthodox approach to the \uc2 Clinton\uc2  probe for some time, saying the need for transparency in the high-profile case calls for unusual methods.\par \par \uc2 He held a public news conference in July to announce he wasn't recommending charges, but he said that in his view Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  had been "extremely careless" with national secrets. That angered members of both parties: Republicans upset Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  wasn't being prosecuted, and Democrats who said it was inappropriate for a law-enforcement leader to criticize someone who wasn't being charged.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Comey then appeared before Congress to defend his recommendation, facing blistering questions from Republicans. He responded to suggestions that the \uc2 FBI\uc2  had caved to political pressure by saying, "You can call us wrong, but don't call us weasels."\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 FBI\uc2  also released various documents from the email probe, including summaries of witness interviews.\par \par \uc2 Those moves by Mr. Comey arguably paved the way for Friday's disclosure. The \uc2 FBI\uc2  chief wrote lawmakers that because he had previously told them the email investigation was completed, he felt compelled to "update" them on the newly discovered messages.\par \par \uc2 That decision wasn't universally cheered by those associated with the \uc2 FBI\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 "I can tell you what the agents are thinking -- they're just hoping the public can understand the difference between upper management and the agents on the street," said Gregory Coleman, a former FBI special agent who retired last year after more than 25 years with the bureau. "The average agent doesn't care if you're Republican or Democrat as long as you're not corrupt."\par \par \uc2 But this may have been a no-win situation for Mr. Comey. For all the criticism he faced from Democrats Friday, had he decided not to disclose the new emails, he would likely have faced similar excoriation from Republicans when it emerged after the \uc2 election\uc2  he had withheld the information.\par \par \uc2 ---\par \par \uc2 Kate O'Keeffe contributed to this article.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=wjco20161029000152"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document J000000020161029ecat00042\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw272\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4080\pichgoal600

On the preview, users will only see as much information as they have provided to \uc2 Facebook\uc2 . For example, if a user has only told \uc2 Facebook\uc2  she lives in California, he or she will just see presidential and statewide races and initiatives. If that user also provides a city or address, he or she will see more local races and initiatives.\par \par \uc2 "For us it goes back to the core mission of connecting people, and that includes connecting people to those that represent them," said Katie Harbath, \uc2 Facebook\uc2 's global politics and government outreach director.\par \par \uc2 In order to avoid accusations of bias, candidates are shown randomly. So some people will see Republican presidential nominee \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  first on their ballot, others will see Democratic nominee \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 .

\par\par \b \uc2 Election\uc2  2016: Teachers Union Head Uses Clout for \uc2 Clinton\b0\par\par\uc2 By Brody Mullins and Melanie Trottman   \par \uc2 509 \uc2 words\par \uc2 29 October 2016\par \uc2 The Wall Street Journal\par \uc2 J\par A5\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 PHILADELPHIA -- Lily Eskelsen Garcia, the president of the National Education Association, is using her union's vast campaign machine to wage a personal fight against Republican presidential nominee \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 As a Hispanic married to a Mexican citizen, she was insulted by his derogatory comments about Mexican immigrants. As the daughter of a \uc2 U.S. Army\uc2  veteran, she was upset by Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's criticism of the parents of a Muslim veteran killed in Afghanistan. And, as a woman, she was offended by Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's comments about how his status as a celebrity allowed him to grope women.\par \par \uc2 "This has hit me in every place I live," Ms. Garcia, 61 years old, said in an interview.\par \par \uc2 Under Ms. Garcia's watch, the teachers union is waging its most extensive \uc2 election\uc2  effort ever. She pushed the union to endorse Democrat \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  last fall, months before the primaries had started, and to start campaigning for her much earlier than the union has in prior elections.\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 NEA\uc2  has doubled the amount of money it is spending on a campaign to help Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  and other Democrats, making it the top-spending labor union in the 2016 elections, according to \uc2 election\uc2 -spending reports. The \uc2 NEA\uc2  has donated more than $14 million to groups that support the Democratic ticket.\par \par \uc2 Ms. Garcia helps direct a union-led super PAC, For Our Future, that has raised roughly $60 million for the presidential race and key Senate races. The \uc2 NEA\uc2  has pledged $5 million to the For Our Future PAC and an affiliate, and another $1 million to the super PAC backing Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's presidential campaign, Priorities USA Action.\par \par \uc2 Her union can also deliver key voters. Among \uc2 NEA\uc2 's three million members, roughly three-quarters are women, many of them with college degrees, who live in the swing suburban areas in presidential battleground states.\par \par \uc2 Some unions have had to work harder this year to hold their members as Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's antiestablishment message and criticism of trade deals has resonated with many of their white voters who lack a college degree.\par \par \uc2 Not all teachers are on board with the \uc2 NEA\uc2 . Nancy Bryant, a middle-school teacher in Brunswick County, N.C., says she won't vote for Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  because of his treatment of women and business failings.\par \par \uc2 But she isn't sold on Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 . She's mulling whetherto pick the "lesser of two evils" or write someone in. "I still think she represents that political establishment that people are afraid of and is not working for them," Ms. Bryant said.\par \par \uc2 Still, the bulk of the \uc2 NEA\uc2  membership is rallying to the \uc2 Clinton\uc2  ticket.\par \par \uc2 "I try to teach my students to be kind," said Joy Bock, a union member and eighth-grade social studies teacher who lives in Licking County, Ohio. "It's hard to teach that when you have someone running for a top office doing the opposite."\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=wjco20161029000148"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document J000000020161029ecat0003y\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw272\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4080\pichgoal600

\par\par \b \uc2 Election\uc2  2016: \uc2 Trump\uc2  Entities Reap Pay --- Well-compensated campaign vendors include airline, golf clubs, hotels and family\b0\par\par\uc2 By Rebecca Ballhaus   \par \uc2 666 \uc2 words\par \uc2 29 October 2016\par \uc2 The Wall Street Journal\par \uc2 J\par A5\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 Republican presidential nominee \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2 's list of highest-paid campaign vendors is brimming with his own name.\par \par \uc2 An airline he owns has drawn the fifth-largest paycheck of any company the campaign paid through Oct. 19. Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  has also paid at least eight of his golf clubs, seven of his hotels and five of his restaurants.\par \par \uc2 In all, he has spent close to $10 million over the course of the \uc2 election\uc2  cycle reimbursing his children for travel expenses and family-owned companies for campaign services, the most recent \uc2 Federal \uc2 Election\uc2  Commission\uc2  reports show.\par \par \uc2 Only four companies have been paid more than the set of \uc2 Trump\uc2  entities: two of his media buyers, who have collectively been paid $59 million; a firm owned by his digital director, which has been paid $58 million; and the company that makes his campaign hats, which has been paid $14 million.\par \par \uc2 The cash returned to the \uc2 Trump\uc2  family and their companies amounts to nearly one-sixth of the total amount of personal money he has donated the campaign through Oct. 19 -- $56 million. He gave $10 million to his campaign on Friday, according to his advisers, bringing the total to $66 million -- a number that still falls far short of the $100 million Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  has said he would spend on his White House effort.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  told Fox News on Friday he was unsure he would give as much as $100 million, saying, "We'll see what's needed."\par \par \uc2 His payments to his companies and frequent plugging of his various businesses on the campaign trail are unprecedented in presidential politics.\par \par \uc2 Don McGahn, general counsel for Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's campaign, has in past interviews defended the businessman's choice to use his properties and companies for campaign activities and said the campaign is complying with \uc2 FEC\uc2  rules.\par \par \uc2 "It makes perfect sense to me that you're going to use facilities that you know are of a certain quality," he said in an August interview. The campaign has also noted that Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's donations to his campaign surpass the amount he has paid his companies.\par \par \uc2 "He's running on his business background, since he has no political background," said \uc2 Kenneth Gross\uc2 , former \uc2 FEC\uc2  head of enforcement, of Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 . He warned that, if elected, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  could struggle to detach himself from his businesses to avoid a significant conflict of interest. "It's going to be difficult, and just turning it over to his children won't necessarily resolve that problem," Mr. Gross said.\par \par \uc2 The GOP nominee has held more than 30 events at \uc2 Trump\uc2  properties since beginning his presidential campaign, including two recent stops at the hotel he opened in Washington, D.C. In the summer, he took reporters to Scotland for the reopening of his luxury golf resort there. At a press conference during the Republican primaries at a Florida golf club he owns, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  displayed steaks, wine and bottles of water that bear his name.\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 Trump\uc2  entities that received the largest checks were Tag Air, an airline Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  owns to which the campaign paid $6.7 million, and \uc2 Trump\uc2  Tower, which was paid $1.4 million in rent. He also paid more than 35 other \uc2 Trump\uc2  companies, including \uc2 Trump\uc2  Restaurants LLC ($150,000), \uc2 Trump\uc2  Payroll Corp. ($186,000) and eight \uc2 Trump\uc2  golf clubs ($623,000) -- including $430,000 just to the Mar-a-Lago Club in Palm Beach, Fla.\par \par \uc2 On Wednesday, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  spent the morning touting his new Washington hotel, in what his campaign billed as a purely corporate event -- despite the presence of his campaign staff and traveling press corps. Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's latest report shows the campaign paid the hotel $13,431 on Oct. 17 for "facility rental/catering services." A \uc2 Trump\uc2  spokeswoman didn't return a request for comment about that payment.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=wjco20161029000147"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document J000000020161029ecat0003x\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw272\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4080\pichgoal600

\par\par \b \uc2 Election\uc2  2016: Early Voting Bolsters \uc2 Clinton\uc2  In Key States\b0\par\par\uc2 By Byron Tau   \par \uc2 593 \uc2 words\par \uc2 29 October 2016\par \uc2 The Wall Street Journal\par \uc2 J\par A5\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 Democrat \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  appears to have a slight edge over Republican rival \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  in a number of battleground states and among important demographic groups based on an analysis of the millions of votes already cast both at polling places and by absentee ballot.\par \par \uc2 Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  is seeing positive signs of enthusiasm in such states as Florida and Nevada. She is also seeing strong turnout rates in the early vote from Latinos and women.\par \par \uc2 But Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  may have an advantage in Ohio and Iowa, where Democratic voter interest appears to be flagging compared with the 2012 presidential, records show.\par \par \uc2 According to data compiled by the United States Elections Project and the Associated Press, at least 17 million votes had been cast as of Friday. Early voting is under way in a number of top battlegrounds including Florida, Nevada, Iowa and North Carolina. Absentee voting has been happening in every state.\par \par \uc2 "\uc2 Clinton\uc2  has opened up a national lead in the polling, and there are some states that have been following that lead in the state polling," said Michael McDonald, who runs the United States Elections Project and is one of the foremost experts on early voting. "We can also see similar patterns of movement in the early vote."\par \par \uc2 Ballots are secret, but many states release partisan registration of voters requesting and returning absentee ballots or voting in-person. While those numbers don't take into account voters who cross over and vote for a candidate of the other party, the early numbers can provide clues into voter enthusiasm and the potential makeup of the electorate.\par \par \uc2 In Florida, Republicans typically have an advantage in early and absentee voting numbers, but this year, the parties are in a virtual dead heat in ballot returns and votes cast. Democrats also cite an increase in female and Latino participation in early voting, with the \uc2 Clinton\uc2  campaign using state data to note that 133,000 Latino voters have returned ballots -- a 99% increase from this point in 2012. Republicans note that the early-voting sites in some GOP-leaning counties aren't yet open.\par \par \uc2 In Nevada, the first week of early and absentee voting showed Democrats ahead by about 25,000 votes on the strength of returns in Clark County, the state's population center that includes Las Vegas. Republicans are running in closer in Washoe County, home to Reno. The GOP is also ahead in absentee ballots statewide.\par \par \uc2 In North Carolina, the number of early voting sites in the state has been reduced since the last \uc2 election\uc2 , but participation is about on par with this point in 2012. As of Friday, Democrats led in early voting and absentee-ballot returns in North Carolina by more than 100,000 votes.\par \par \uc2 Only a handful of states release data about the gender of early voters, but the figures that are available show female ballot returns outpacing male ones, according to numbers compiled by the United States Elections Project.\par \par \uc2 Republican operatives say they aren't alarmed by early voting trends in the battleground states, with one party official saying the states the GOP hopes to win are still within reach.\par \par \uc2 In Iowa and Ohio, early voting points to lackluster Democratic interest rather than Republican enthusiasm. Key counties around Cleveland and Columbus show lower levels of Democratic early voting, Mr. McDonald said. In Iowa, Republicans are flat in terms of ballots requested, while Democrats are down.\par \par \uc2 ---\par \par \uc2 Dante Chinni contributed to this article.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=wjco20161029000146"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document J000000020161029ecat0003w\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw272\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4080\pichgoal600

\par\par \b \uc2 City News: Two Old Pros Vie to Fix Gridlock\b0\par\par\uc2 By Thomas MacMillan   \par \uc2 803 \uc2 words\par \uc2 29 October 2016\par \uc2 The Wall Street Journal\par \uc2 J\par A15\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 Democrat Tom Suozzi and Republican Jack Martins, who are vying for the U.S. House seat that encompasses most of Long Island's North Shore, both said the district needs a leader who will challenge the business-as-usual climate in the nation's capital.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Suozzi, a former Nassau County executive, said he is a fighter, while Mr. Martins, a state senator, described himself as a consensus builder.\par \par \uc2 "The problem is that there are people that want to keep the status quo the way it is," Mr. Suozzi said earlier this week at a debate in Albertson, N.Y. "You need the guts to stand up to those powerful interests."\par \par \uc2 Mr. Martins said he can break down partisan gridlock by finding common ground and "building consensus across the aisle."\par \par \uc2 Both men are running to succeed Rep. Steve Israel, a Democrat who decided not to seek re-\uc2 election\uc2 . The Third Congressional District comprises portions of Nassau, Suffolk, and Queens counties. The \uc2 election\uc2  is Nov. 8.\par \par \uc2 A Newsday-News 12-Siena College poll this month showed Mr. Suozzi held a 16-point lead over Mr. Martins.\par \par \uc2 For Mr. Suozzi, a former gubernatorial candidate, the race is a chance to re-enter politics after several defeats. The 54-year-old served four terms as mayor of Glen Cove before becoming the executive of Nassau County in 2002.\par \par \uc2 He ran unsuccessfully for the Democratic gubernatorial nomination in 2006 against Eliot Spitzer and then lost his county executive seat to Republican Ed Mangano in 2009. He tried to unseat Mr. Mangano in 2013 and lost.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Suozzi now talks about those defeats as lessons learned.\par \par \uc2 "When I ran against Spitzer, I ran against the entire party," Mr. Suozzi said.\par \par \uc2 Although he said he got "crushed" in that race, he took a stand by calling for a property-tax cap, a position that Mr. Spitzer later adopted.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Suozzi said he stood up to the Nassau County police union on salaries and pressed former state Assembly Speaker \uc2 Sheldon Silver\uc2 , a Democrat, on a cap for the local cost of Medicaid.\par \par \uc2 "I have a history in my career of standing up to very powerful forces . . . even though I had to pay a price for it," Mr. Suozzi said.\par \par \uc2 Supporters of Mr. Suozzi jokingly refer to a "Suozzi curse" that has brought down his former rivals. Mr. Spitzer resigned in 2008 amid a prostitution scandal, Mr. Silver was convicted last year of corruption charges and Mr. Mangano this month was indicted on corruption charges. Mr. Silver is appealing his conviction, and Mr. Mangano has pleaded not guilty.\par \par \uc2 With Mr. Martins behind in the polls, the National Republican Congressional Committee canceled a planned ad buy in the district. But the GOP isn't counting Mr. Martins completely out, said Chris Pack, a spokesman for the committee.\par \par \uc2 "Jack Martins is no stranger to tough races," said Mr. Pack, noting that Mr. Suozzi is leveraging strong name recognition from years of running for office.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Martins's campaign was hampered this year by a long legal battle with a would-be Republican rival, Philip Pidot, who fought Mr. Martins and elections officials in court to get on the primary ballot, but was ultimately unsuccessful.\par \par \uc2 Like Mr. Suozzi, Mr. Martins, 49, is a former mayor. He served eight years in that capacity in the village of Mineola before winning the state Senate seat in 2010.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Martins said Mr. Suozzi has been a polarizing figure, a charge he denies. Mr. Martins said he has a record of working with others to get things done, playing a role in passing on-time, responsible budgets in Albany, and helping to lower taxes.\par \par \uc2 As the race nears the finish line, both candidates have run increasingly pointed ads. Mr. Suozzi released an ad calling Mr. Martins "hypocritical" for attacking him for raising taxes since Mr. Martins raised taxes when he was mayor. And Mr. Martins released an ad criticizing Mr. Suozzi's attempts to link him to former Senate Majority Leader Dean Skelos, a Republican who is appealing his conviction last year on corruption charges.\par \par \uc2 Neither candidate has been making this year's presidential campaign a central issue. Mr. Martins said he would vote for GOP nominee \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2 , but he isn't endorsing him. And Mr. Suozzi said he would vote for Democratic nominee \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , but disagrees with her tax plan.\par \par \uc2 As the debate wrapped up earlier this week, both candidates offered their closing arguments.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Martins promised to work to bring the country together at a time when it feels pulled apart. And Mr. Suozzi promised to take on entrenched powers by having the "guts to stand up and the ability to win the fight."\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=wjco20161029000133"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document J000000020161029ecat0003j\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw272\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4080\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 Business World\par \b \uc2 Liberals Look to Lawless FCC to Stop a Media Deal\b0\par\par\uc2 By Holman W. Jenkins, Jr.   \par \uc2 913 \uc2 words\par \uc2 29 October 2016\par \uc2 The Wall Street Journal\par \uc2 J\par A11\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 For once there was nary a word of reproof when \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  showed a lack of respect for the limits of presidential authority. Presidents do not get to reject business mergers, as Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  said he would do to last week's proposed merger of \uc2 AT&T\uc2  and \uc2 Time Warner\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Then again, maybe the joke's on America. The rule of law has long since ceased to apply to antitrust merger reviews, as Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  correctly intuits. Politics is in charge. In fast-moving markets, companies can't wait for courts to vindicate their rights. They either bend to whatever exactions politicized regulators' demand or they spike their deals.\par \par \uc2 The parties to the \uc2 AT&T\uc2  and \uc2 Time Warner\uc2  transaction are all but publicly praying that the Justice Department's antitrust division will get the final say on their deal, believing Justice is the less-politicized agency. They dread the \uc2 Federal Communications Commission\uc2  finding an excuse to stick its highly politicized nose in.\par \par \uc2 Good luck with that. Liberal groups are already lining up against the deal. Antitrust offers no means for shooting it down. That leaves the \uc2 FCC\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Under Obama FCC chief \uc2 Tom Wheeler\uc2 , \uc2 AT&T\uc2 's wireless and fixed broadband operations now qualify as a regulated public utility, while \uc2 Time Warner\uc2  owns satellite licenses that it needs permission to transfer under the agency's squishy "public interest" standard. That could be all the excuse the \uc2 FCC\uc2  needs to take the deal hostage until the parties accept, say, new net-neutrality or privacy whims the agency (or its camp followers) dream up on the spot.\par \par \uc2 Just to be clear, whatever it used to mean, net neutrality has come to mean acquiescing to \uc2 Netflix\uc2 's disapproval of data caps or usage-based pricing on the broadband networks that deliver its video. And privacy is the \uc2 FCC\uc2 's chosen instrument for blocking broadband carriers from competing with the online advertising oligopoly of \uc2 Facebook\uc2  and \uc2 Google\uc2 , both of which are big Obama supporters.\par \par \uc2 If there's any doubt about the \uc2 FCC\uc2  trying to shoehorn its way in, activist groups like Free Press and \uc2 Public Knowledge\uc2  already are staking out the maximalist ground that the deal must be stopped cold. These are the same groups at whose behest President Obama imposed utility regulation on the supposedly independent \uc2 FCC\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 The public interest, alas, will be much mentioned and little consulted in the orgy that now begins. Most telling, amid the journalistic deluge this week, was a Bloomberg News story that chortled that AT&T Chief \uc2 Randall Stephenson\uc2 's donation list features way too many politicians of the wrong party given that a Democratic administration likely will rule on his transaction.\par \par \uc2 Though analysts are mixed on the deal's business prospects, for the peanut gallery the key is \uc2 AT&T\uc2 's conviction that wireless will soon be competitive with cable to deliver hi-def TV.\par \par \uc2 Whether or not the deal pays off for the principals, it heralds a new era of truly ubiquitous, competitive broadband. \uc2 AT&T\uc2  hopes to use \uc2 Time Warner\uc2 's entertainment properties, such as \uc2 CNN\uc2  and \uc2 HBO\uc2 , to generate, in an otherwise stagnant wireless market, advertising and retail revenues to support the deployment in the next few years of superfast 5G wireless technology. The same philosophy lies behind fellow wireless giant \uc2 Verizon\uc2 's pending acquisition of \uc2 Yahoo\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Rolling out 5G -- even with cost-saving innovations like software-defined networking -- will be a costly undertaking. It doesn't mean merely attaching updated radio transceivers to existing towers. It requires a vast expansion in cell sites, even within buildings, partly to take advantage of new millimeter wave spectrum.\par \par \uc2 These sites have to be connected to each other via network backhaul, either wirelessly or with fiber. The \uc2 New York Times\uc2 , wrongly thinking 5G means simply and solely millimeter wave spectrum, on Thursday cast doubt on the whole idea that wireless will ever compete with fixed broadband. Uh huh. Try asking \uc2 Google\uc2 , which is conspicuously backing away from its vaunted Google Fiber operation, saying laying fiber is too expensive -- the future is wireless. If \uc2 Google\uc2  is wrong, forget driverless cars, forget augmented reality.\par \par \uc2 What the Times also misses is that this is a gamble the big wireless players like \uc2 AT&T\uc2  and \uc2 Verizon\uc2  can't refuse. Next year, cable giants, led by \uc2 Comcast\uc2  and a newly enlarged \uc2 Charter Communications\uc2 , will be coming after their wireless customers whether wireless operators seek the fight or not.\par \par \uc2 In this excruciating presidential campaign, we've been repeatedly struck by the number of sophisticated people -- a Supreme Court lawyer, technologists, money managers, economists, an astronaut -- who support Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , in full view of his liabilities, because he's the available lever against a Washington that has become self-interested and indifferent to its impact on the productive citizens of this country.\par \par \uc2 Businesses have no choice but to follow technology and market logic where it leads as best they can, in a world where politics increasingly exists to extract tolls for allowing them to do so.\par \par \uc2 This is where 240 years of American experiment in lawful, representative government have brought us. The question will linger long past \uc2 Election\uc2  Day: Do voters have the power to renew the American experiment by driving our leaders to reform our institutions and fix what has so manifestly gone wrong?\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=wjco20161029000104"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document J000000020161029ecat0002r\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw272\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4080\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 [When Andrew Jackson lost the White House to John Quincy Adams in 1824, the accusations began to fly.]\par \par \uc2 Andrew Jackson had every reason to consider himself the victor of the presidential \uc2 election\uc2  of 1824. In a hard-fought campaign, he had won the most popular votes and electoral votes, too. But because he didn't gain an outright majority in the Electoral College, the \uc2 election\uc2  was thrown into the House of Representatives, as the Constitution stipulated.\par \par \uc2 There Jackson faced his top rivals for the White House, Secretary of State John Quincy Adams and Treasury Secretary William Crawford. With Crawford out of contention because of an incapacitating stroke, it was plain that either Jackson or Adams would carry a majority of the 24 states that then constituted the union.\par \par \uc2 The key to victory lay with the wily speaker of the House, Henry Clay of Kentucky, who also had been a candidate for president but had finished well behind. After a series of discreet and carefully indirect conversations with Adams, Clay was persuaded that he would be asked to serve as secretary of state in an Adams administration, thus improving his own future presidential prospects. Clay announced his support for Adams.\par \par \uc2 Privately, Clay also appears to have persuaded the congressional delegation of his native Kentucky, as well as those of Ohio and Missouri, to throw their support to the standard-bearer of old New England. Adams carried all three states on his way to a stunning first-ballot victory in the House of Representatives. The moment Adams named Clay as his secretary of state, an enraged Jackson began claiming that the \uc2 election\uc2  had been rigged.\par \par \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2 , as we learned in the last of his debates with \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , is threatening to become the first presidential candidate in modern history to lose an \uc2 election\uc2  and call it fixed. But in the nation's early years, when democratic norms had not yet come to be regarded as holy writ, the presidential loser could, and sometimes did, make just that claim.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's goal, like Jackson's, would not be to get the results overturned but rather to cripple a winner whom he regarded, or at least claimed to regard, as illegitimate -- and to position himself as the beneficiary of that failure. Jackson's subsequent crusade against Adams shows just how ruinous such an allegation can be.\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 election\uc2  of 1824 pitted America's demographic and political past against its future. Adams was the son of a famous Founder, a Federalist from the ancient Commonwealth of Massachusetts, a Puritan in the depths of his soul, a patrician who despised party politics and had few illusions about "the people."\par \par \uc2 Jackson was a new American, a poor boy from the rural South who became a successful lawyer in the frontier territory of Tennessee before joining the army. Jackson was as remote and forbidding a figure as Adams, but to voters, he was a military hero. During the War of 1812, he had slaughtered Creek Indians alongside Davy Crockett and defeated the British in the Battle of New Orleans, where his toughness won him the nickname "Old Hickory."\par \par \uc2 Adams, who had served President George Washington as ambassador to the Netherlands (a position he accepted at age 26), represented continuity with the founding generation. He was an amateur scholar (but serious enough to serve as the first Boylston Professor of Rhetoric and Oratory at Harvard) and an unbending moralist who once proudly noted in his journal a political rival's crack that "he believed I considered every public measure as I should a proposition in Euclid, abstracted from any party considerations." That was precisely how Adams considered most political propositions.\par \par \uc2 Jackson ran against the status quo. "Intrigue, management and corruption," he thundered in widely reprinted letters, had destroyed the nation's fabric. "Nothing but the virtue of the people" could restore America's founding ideals.\par \par \uc2 Nor was Adams his only target. Henry Clay looked to be no less formidable a rival. And while charges of corruption would hardly stick to the irreproachable Adams, Clay, a career politician, had a reputation for secrecy and gamesmanship. Jackson once called him "the basest, meanest scoundrel that ever disgraced the image of God."\par \par \uc2 Jackson was thus the first presidential candidate to run against Washington.\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 election\uc2  of 1824 took place during a brief interval of nonpartisan politics. The Federalist Party of Alexander Hamilton and John Adams had disappeared, and the Democratic Party that Jackson himself would usher into being had not yet taken shape. President James Monroe called himself a "Democratic-Republican," as did both John Quincy Adams and Jackson.\par \par \uc2 On the issues, Adams and Clay were nationalists who championed an active federal government, while Crawford and Jackson, the Southerners, stood for states' rights. But no one salient issue emerged to define the race, which in the end turned into a contest of personal popularity.\par \par \uc2 States voted over a period of months. By the fall, it had become clear that only Jackson enjoyed national popularity. Adams had won New England, Crawford had taken parts of the Deep South and Clay portions of the West. Jackson won 99 electoral votes, Adams 84, Crawford 41 and Clay 37.\par \par \uc2 Since the House had never before used the constitutional procedure for a presidential runoff (though it had used a system, afterward changed, to choose Thomas Jefferson over Aaron Burr in 1800), no one could predict what the outcome would be, or could say what tactics were or weren't permitted. Both Adams and Jackson courted Clay, who immensely enjoyed, and thus protracted, his role as kingmaker.\par \par \uc2 Clay and Jackson despised one another, and Clay told a friend that as between "the two evils," he preferred the priggish and self-righteous Adams to the militaristic and perhaps demagogic Jackson. Clay dispatched an emissary to sound out Adams, who offered assurances that he "harbored no hostility" toward his vanquished rival. This was not even remotely true, since Adams believed, with good reason, that Clay had secretly tried to blacken his reputation in the course of the campaign.\par \par \uc2 But the signal had been sent and received. At a meeting on Jan. 9, 1825, in Adams's home on F Street in Washington, D.C., the two men held "a long conversation explanatory of the past and prospective of the future," as Adams wrote in his diary, with uncharacteristic circumlocution.\par \par \uc2 Whether or not Adams offered Clay a quid, the wished-for quo wasn't long in coming. Adams hadn't received a single popular vote in Kentucky, and the state legislature had passed a resolution overwhelmingly supporting Jackson. But on Jan. 24, the state's congressional caucus announced that it would go with Adams.\par \par \uc2 Even men who knew that Clay preferred Adams, and that Adams welcomed the prospect of Clay in his cabinet, understood that the two men had conspired to suborn the will of the people of Kentucky. It was the most morally compromised act of John Quincy Adams's career -- indeed, almost the only one.\par \par \uc2 Jackson had campaigned against corruption without furnishing any evidence of it. Now news of the "corrupt bargain" swept the country, thanks in no small part to Jackson's enthusiastic fanning of the flames. In early 1826, he and John C. Calhoun of South Carolina, Adams's vice president but already his rival, lent $5,000 to the editors of the United States Telegraph, a new Washington daily, and recruited a slashing proslavery polemicist to serve as editor.\par \par \uc2 The paper hammered away virtually every day at the "bargain, intrigue and management" that had elevated Adams and Clay to power. The following spring, Jackson established a group of supporters whom he called the Central Corresponding Committee to block "falsehoods and calumny, by the publication of truth." It was the first political war room.\par \par \uc2 What made Jackson America's first truly democratic leader was not his vague expressions of faith in "the people" but his immense success in conscripting voters into active engagement with his political campaign. Jackson built a national party machine to support his candidacy. Adams, meanwhile, was governing in the spirit of his hero, George Washington. He refused to use patronage to reward his friends or punish his enemies, even as Jackson's allies castigated him for allegedly doing so.\par \par \uc2 Adams made no attempt to conciliate his rivals. He had spent years formulating his big-government philosophy, and he took the opportunity of his first message to Congress to lay it out, calling for new departments, a national university, federally sponsored research and an ambitious program of "internal improvements" -- roads, bridges, canals. When Clay advised him to propose nothing that Congress was likely to reject, Adams replied loftily that he would "look to a practicability of a longer range than a simple session of Congress."\par \par \uc2 Jackson could also take some credit for Adams's failures, for his relentless attacks had robbed Adams of the legitimacy he would have enjoyed as a living link to the Founders and the nation's foremost public servant. Adams's rivals in Congress, including the cunning Martin Van Buren of New York, knew that they could attack the president with impunity.\par \par \uc2 For some time, Jackson had been proclaiming that he had contemptuously spurned Clay when the latter had sought to reach the same devious bargain with him that he had ultimately made with Adams. By 1826, Jackson had been forced to admit that this was false; Clay had never so much as met with him during this period. Clay exulted that the tide had finally turned.\par \par \uc2 He was wrong: The "corrupt bargain" had so deeply ingrained itself in the national consciousness that facts to the contrary could have no effect. In the 1826 by-\uc2 election\uc2 , the Jacksonians gained a majority in the House and began to act as the governing party.\par \par \uc2 In 1828, Andrew Jackson was elected president with 56% of the popular vote and two-thirds of the electoral vote. Three times as many Americans voted as had in 1824. It was the beginning of the "Jacksonian Revolution," a period that, according to the historian Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr., saw the rise of new classes of men, Eastern laborers as well as Western pioneers, who challenged the existing order and demanded a political system that worked on their behalf. Schlesinger's Jackson is the great-grandfather of modern liberalism (a patrimony that the small-government Jackson would have furiously forsworn).\par \par \uc2 Jackson's demagogic four-year campaign against Adams helped to wreck the presidency of one of America's most gifted statesmen. At the same time, however, Jackson embodied a new turn in American democracy, deftly channeling the new spirit of political engagement. By the 1820s, democracy itself had become too elemental a force to be checked or to need the promotion of any one man.\par \par \uc2 Today, American democracy is more vulnerable in important respects than it was in the early days of the republic. Though our institutions are vastly more mature than they were almost two centuries ago, our habits of mind are more brittle. In 1824, we were still a very new country, fired by the raw energies of youth. Even a half-century ago, the America of John F. Kennedy was expansive and forward-looking in its view of itself and the world.\par \par \uc2 But the spirit of enthusiasm, the almost blind optimism about the future, that made America so exceptional has curdled recently into a sour distrust. Many Americans are all too ready to believe the worst not only of their leaders but of one another. Standards of civility and mutual respect have given way to angry accusations of deception and bad faith.\par \par \uc2 Democracy, after all, is not just a set of practices but a culture. It lives not only in such formal mechanisms as party and ballot but in the instincts and expectations of citizens. Objective circumstances -- jobs, war, competition from abroad -- shape that political culture, but so do the words and deeds of leaders.\par \par \uc2 ---\par \par \uc2 Mr. Traub is the author, most recently, of "John Quincy Adams: Militant Spirit."\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=wjco20161029000077"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document J000000020161029ecat00021\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw272\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4080\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 Heard on the Street\par \b \uc2 GDP Signals Growth Next Year\b0\par\par\uc2 By Justin Lahart   \par \uc2 462 \uc2 words\par \uc2 29 October 2016\par \uc2 The Wall Street Journal\par \uc2 J\par B12\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 [Financial Analysis and Commentary]\par \par \uc2 The economy has picked up some speed. Maybe it can maintain it.\par \par \uc2 Gross domestic product grew at a 2.9% annual rate in the third quarter, the Commerce Department reported Friday, significantly better than the 1.4% it posted in the second quarter and its fastest pace in two years. More important than that headline figure were the details of the report that suggest the economy may be achieving better balance.\par \par \uc2 Consumer spending has been the economy's bulwark, as companies have hesitated to invest and government spending as a share of GDP fell to its lowest level since 1950.\par \par \uc2 But even with steady job growth fueling income gains, Americans can't act as the economy's single engine indefinitely. Indeed, consumer spending actually was slower in the third quarter, growing at a 2.1% annual rate versus the second quarter's torrid 4.3%.\par \par \uc2 With household finances in good shape and the unemployment rate at 5%, consumer spending likely will pick back up a bit.\par \par \uc2 Still, with much of the post-recession pent-up demand for big-ticket items like cars now likely exhausted, it isn't about to start running hot.\par \par \uc2 But at the corporate level, spending is showing some signs of life. Spending on nonresidential structures -- office buildings, warehouses, oil wells and the like -- grew at a 5.4% rate in the third quarter after falling 2.1% in the second. That suggests that the energy sector's drag on business spending is starting to ease.\par \par \uc2 Spending on equipment fell at a 2.7% rate, but this was actually the smallest drop of the year. It may be that with the removal of \uc2 election\uc2  uncertainty next month, companies will step up their spending on equipment in order to boost productivity and allay rising labor costs.\par \par \uc2 With both \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  and \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  proposing policies that would boost federal spending (Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  on things like infrastructure and education, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  on things like border protection and defense), the long decline in the government's share of GDP may be coming to a close.\par \par \uc2 In what most investors see as the likely scenario -- a victory for Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  with Republicans hanging on to the House -- some sort of modest budget package next year might be the best bet. That would nudge GDP upwards.\par \par \uc2 None of this argues the economy is about to surge. More things would have to come together, including a more substantial pickup in the housing market and a renewed focus on growth from U.S. companies, for that to happen. But the third quarter does signal a strong chance of better growth next year.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=wjco20161029000079"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document J000000020161029ecat00022\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 National Desk; SECTA\par \b \uc2 Lawyer Accuses Justice Thomas of Groping Her at a Dinner Party in 1999\b0\par\par\uc2 By ADAM LIPTAK \par \uc2 738 \uc2 words\par \uc2 28 October 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 18\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 WASHINGTON -- An Alaska lawyer has accused Justice \uc2 Clarence Thomas\uc2  of groping her at a dinner party in 1999, a claim that Justice Thomas called ''preposterous.''\par \par \uc2 The lawyer, Moira Smith, who was a 23-year-old Truman Foundation scholar at the time, told The National Law Journal that Justice Thomas had ''sort of cupped his hand around my butt and pulled me pretty close to him'' as she was making final preparations for the party, in a Washington suburb.\par \par \uc2 Justice Thomas, continuing to squeeze her buttocks, urged her to sit next to him at the dinner, Ms. Smith said. She declined. He asked if she was sure, Ms. Smith recalled. ''I said yes, and that was the end of it,'' she said.\par \par \uc2 Through a court spokeswoman, Justice Thomas told The National Law Journal that the episode ''never happened.'' The spokeswoman, Kathleen L. Arberg, said she had nothing to add to that statement.\par \par \uc2 Justice Thomas, 68, took his seat on the court 25 years ago after a searing confirmation battle that also featured accusations of sexual harassment.\par \par \uc2 Ms. Smith, who is now general counsel of Enstar Natural Gas, declined a request for an interview. But in a statement, she said that while she had felt powerless at the time of the groping, ''17 years later, it is clear that sexual harassment, misconduct and assault continue to be pervasive, having an impact on all women.'' She added, ''I choose to speak out now in the hope that this will change.''\par \par \uc2 In the National Law Journal article, Ms. Smith said her public accusation was prompted by the disclosure this month of a 2005 recording in which Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2  boasted about kissing women without their consent and groping them.\par \par \uc2 She said she might have been flattered by the attention of a Supreme Court justice had he not been so aggressive. ''But it felt somewhat menacing, and I felt vulnerable,'' she told Marcia Coyle, a reporter.\par \par \uc2 Three of Ms. Smith's former housemates and her ex-husband said Ms. Smith had told them about the episode soon after it happened, according to The National Law Journal. But several guests at the dinner -- held by the head of the Truman Foundation, which awards scholarships to young people who plan to pursue a career in public service -- said they had no recollection of any inappropriate behavior.\par \par \uc2 In Justice Thomas's confirmation hearing in 1991, Anita Hill, a law professor who had worked for Justice Thomas before he became a judge, said he had tried to date her, used sexual innuendo and described pornographic movies in vivid detail.\par \par \uc2 Justice Thomas, then a federal appeals court judge, responded to the accusations with fury. ''This is a circus,'' he said. ''It's a national disgrace. And from my standpoint, as a black American, it is a high-tech lynching.''\par \par \uc2 The new accusation is not plausible, said Carrie Severino, a former law clerk to Justice Thomas.\par \par \uc2 ''A justice of the \uc2 U.S. Supreme Court\uc2  was the guest of honor at a tiny event, surely attracting the sort of swarm the justices tend to attract, yet not a single witness can corroborate Smith's outlandish story,'' Ms. Severino said.\par \par \uc2 Mark Paoletta, who worked in the White House Counsel's Office during Justice Thomas's confirmation hearings, said the accusations were motivated by politics.\par \par \uc2 ''Justice Thomas has hired more than 30 women law clerks over the years, has worked closely with them day in and day out, and none of them has ever accused him of any inappropriate conduct,'' he said. ''In fact, they hold him in the highest regard. I do not consider it a coincidence that this Democratic smear on Justice Thomas comes as he celebrates 25 years on the court, and in the heat of a presidential \uc2 election\uc2 .''\par \par \uc2 On Wednesday, after hearing of Ms. Smith's accusations but before they were made public, Justice Thomas was interviewed at \uc2 the Heritage Foundation\uc2 . He was generally upbeat and expansive, but he turned serious when asked about his confirmation hearings.\par \par \uc2 ''I think that we have decided that rather than confront the disagreements and the differences of opinion, we'll simply annihilate the person who disagrees with us,'' he said.

\par\par \b \uc2 Mergers Hit Record As \uc2 Election\uc2  Looms\b0\par\par\uc2 By Dana Cimilluca, Dana Mattioli and David Benoit   \par \uc2 796 \uc2 words\par \uc2 28 October 2016\par \uc2 The Wall Street Journal\par \uc2 J\par A1\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 The eve of a presidential \uc2 election\uc2  is typically a time when companies put merger plans on hold and wait for clarity on crucial matters like antitrust policy. Not this year.\par \par \uc2 Less than two weeks before voters head to the polls, U.S. companies have unleashed a wave of deals that has made this month the busiest ever for mergers and acquisitions. The deal making culminated in \uc2 Qualcomm Inc\uc2 .'s agreement Thursday to buy \uc2 NXP Semiconductors NV\uc2  for $39 billion, part of a swirl of consolidation in the semiconductor industry.\par \par \uc2 The NXP acquisition counts as the second-largest pure technology deal of all time after \uc2 Dell Inc\uc2 .'s recent acquisition of \uc2 EMC Corp\uc2 . for about $60 billion. And it comes just days after \uc2 AT&T Inc\uc2 . struck the biggest takeover deal of the year, with a pact to buy \uc2 Time Warner Inc\uc2 . for $85 billion. A day earlier, \uc2 British American Tobacco PLC\uc2  made a $47 billion offer to take full control of \uc2 Reynolds American Inc\uc2 . in a move that would create the world's largest listed tobacco company by revenue and market value.\par \par \uc2 In all, U.S. companies have struck $248.9 billion of merger agreements this month, according to Dealogic, surpassing the previous record of $240 billion in July 2015. Last week's volume set a single-week record of more than $177 billion.\par \par \uc2 Though deal making has been down about 20% this year from last year's record pace, the acceleration has been dramatic, and there are signs it will continue.\par \par \uc2 On Thursday, The Wall Street Journal reported that \uc2 CenturyLink Inc\uc2 . and \uc2 Level 3 Communications Inc\uc2 . are in advanced talks to combine, in a deal that would give the business-telecommunications companies greater heft in a brutally competitive industry -- and likely be valued at more than $20 billion.\par \par \uc2 The burst of activity is all the more surprising given that political opposition to mergers has grown in recent years as the Obama administration has moved to block a number of marquee deals and politicians of all stripes have come out against corporate tie-ups. The announcement of the \uc2 Time Warner\uc2  deal met widespread resistance, and has helped cause the media company's stock to trade about $20 below the per-share price that \uc2 AT&T\uc2  is offering for it. Companies have continued to strike mergers at a breakneck pace in the past few days, showing how strong the urge is for them to combine at a time of persistently sluggish economic growth.\par \par \uc2 "A lot of industries are going through transformations and what CEOs and boards are focused on now is how to position their companies for the future," said \uc2 Steven Baronoff\uc2 , chairman of global M&A at Bank of America Corp. "Whether there is an \uc2 election\uc2  going on is not that relevant in how they set themselves up for the long term."\par \par \uc2 Beyond the widespread belief among business leaders that \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  will win the presidential \uc2 election\uc2 , which is likely to bring continuation of relatively strict antitrust enforcement, a number of factors help explain that urge. With sales growth hard to come by in a slow economy, companies are casting about for ways to cut costs and keep profit growing. But after years of belt-tightening they need new sources of efficiency, such as a merger with a rival. Many are also looking to deploy their cash hoards in ways that will ensure future growth after spending years aggressively buying back stock.\par \par \uc2 And investors are egging them on. Like with the potential telecom deal, shareholders of both \uc2 Qualcomm\uc2  and NXP cheered their union, driving up both companies' stocks sharply.\par \par \uc2 Helping explain that reaction is the lackluster outlook for profits. Earnings for companies in the S&P 500 have fallen for five consecutive quarters but are now expected to rise 1.1% in the third quarter, according to research from FactSet.\par \par \uc2 Many of the recently announced deals may not end up happening. A number of big potential takeovers have been challenged by regulators and, in many cases, fallen apart. In the biggest, \uc2 Pfizer Inc\uc2 . abandoned its $150 billion agreement to buy drug maker \uc2 Allergan PLC\uc2  after the administration tightened rules on so-called tax inversions.\par \par \uc2 The government is now challenging two planned mergers of health insurers that would shrink the top five players in the industry to three.\par \par \uc2 That isn't expected to change after \uc2 Election\uc2  Day. "It has been a pretty [tough] regime for the past few years, and most people think that regardless of who wins, regulatory scrutiny is likely to continue, so there is no reason to hold off deal making," said \uc2 Bank of America\uc2 's Mr. Baronoff.\par \par {\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw380\pich310\picscaley75\picscalex75\picwgoal7600\pichgoal6200

\par\par \uc2 National Desk; SECTA\par \b \uc2 Pro-\uc2 Trump\uc2  Stand Imperils Re-\uc2 Election\uc2  of G.O.P. Star\b0\par\par\uc2 By EMMARIE HUETTEMAN \par \uc2 1,416 \uc2 words\par \uc2 28 October 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 17\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 MODESTO, Calif. -- For more than 15 years, Representative \uc2 Darrell Issa\uc2  has not so much as put out a yard sign. A Republican comfortably ensconced in his Southern California seat, he has blown by one challenger after another since being elected in 2000.\par \par \uc2 The days of his double-digit victories may be over. When the campaign season began, Mr. Issa was on nobody's list of vulnerable incumbents. Often cited as the wealthiest member of Congress, he is said to be able to bankroll his own campaign. His district has not undergone major demographic changes. And for years, he had promised to be the most vigilant interrogator of the Obama administration from his perch on an oversight committee, which Republicans cheered.\par \par \uc2 But in this upside-down year, Mr. Issa finds himself suddenly in danger of defeat, a prognosis worsened by his decision to embrace \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 ''It's a mystifyingly bad campaign that Issa's run,'' said \uc2 David Wasserman\uc2 , an editor of the nonpartisan Cook Political Report. ''And he is in grave danger.''\par \par \uc2 Democrats, who cannot contain their glee at the prospect of his defeat, are trying to make the case that Mr. Issa is not alone. ''If \uc2 Darrell Issa\uc2 , a long-term member who is well known in his district and outside his district, who is the richest member of Congress, is on the cusp of losing,'' said Representative Xavier Becerra of California, a member of House Democratic leadership, ''then it's not just \uc2 Darrell Issa\uc2  who's going down.''\par \par \uc2 Wealthier, white voters in the suburbs dominate Mr. Issa's district, an idyllic stretch of mountains and coastline between Los Angeles and San Diego, including San Clemente, where a disgraced President Richard M. Nixon went to write his memoirs.\par \par \uc2 About seven hours north, Representative Jeff Denham, a Republican who was first elected in 2010, is also facing a tough re-\uc2 election\uc2  fight. His district includes Modesto, a city of 205,000 that was depicted by the filmmaker George Lucas, a native son, in ''American Graffiti.'' Today, the poverty rate hovers around 19 percent in a district where much of the economy depends on farming -- particularly almonds, a crop greedy for water in the drought-stricken Central Valley of California where Modesto lies.\par \par \uc2 President Obama won at least once in each incumbent's district -- twice in Mr. Denham's, where some party-agnostic, regionally focused conservative Democrats are more likely to refer to themselves as ''valleycrats.'' Both districts have a large and growing Latino population, a group that historically is less likely to vote but is expected to do so in this year of antipathy toward Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Mr. Denham, like Mr. Issa, has expressed support for Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  -- or at least declined to push him away.\par \par \uc2 California Republicans have no candidate for the Senate because the state's open primary left two Democrats vying for the seat of Barbara Boxer, who is retiring. Numerous ballot initiatives focused on progressive causes could also give Republicans few reasons to turn out.\par \par \uc2 ''Normal people don't get motivated by congressional candidates,'' said Daniel Schnur, a professor at the University of Southern California, who was the communications director for Senator John McCain of Arizona in his 2000 presidential bid. ''They get motivated by the top of the ticket, and then they stick around to vote down ballot.''\par \par \uc2 The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee and the House Majority PAC, a Democratic ''super PAC,'' have invested more than $4 million to defeat Mr. Issa and Mr. Denham. The Congressional Leadership Fund, a Republican super PAC, recently gave more than $1.6 million to Mr. Denham as part of a nationwide investment to shore up Republican candidates.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Issa, who endorsed Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  after previously backing Senator \uc2 Marco Rubio\uc2  of Florida, has signed on to the Republican nominee's national security advisory board. When a 2005 recording surfaced in which Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  talked about sexually assaulting women, Mr. Issa's campaign released a statement condemning the remarks as ''wholly inappropriate, offensive and unfitting of anyone seeking to lead our nation,'' but the congressman did not rescind his support.\par \par \uc2 But he has tried an even more surprising move: embracing Mr. Obama. The former chairman of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, Mr. Issa so relished his position as the chief interrogator of the Obama administration during hearings on the \uc2 Internal Revenue Service\uc2  scandal and the attacks on a diplomatic compound in Benghazi, Libya, that he used a stick figure in a police officer's cap as his \uc2 Twitter\uc2  avatar. Yet he recently distributed campaign mailers promoting a bill for which he was one of 40 co-sponsors that included a photograph of Mr. Obama signing it into law.\par \par \uc2 ''That is the definition of chutzpah,'' Mr. Obama said of Mr. Issa during a fund-raiser on Sunday in the San Diego enclave of La Jolla.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Issa also dallied on investing in his race, waiting until October to start running ads, Mr. Wasserman said.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Issa's opponent, Doug Applegate, a retired Marine colonel who served in Iraq, has run ads with the help of significant financial support from the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Issa is fighting back, highlighting in part accusations made against Mr. Applegate by his former wife in the early 2000s. According to court records, first reported by \uc2 Politico\uc2 , she was granted two temporary restraining orders after saying Mr. Applegate had threatened her during a divorce and custody battle.\par \par \uc2 ''You have to look at the first person who responded to those really baseless allegations: It was my ex-wife,'' Mr. Applegate said in an interview. ''She was offended at the attacks, said that she supported me and was going to be voting for me in November.''\par \par \uc2 For his part, Mr. Issa is spending money ''in a targeted and data-driven way to ensure the best bang for the buck,'' Calvin Moore, Mr. Issa's spokesman, wrote in an email.\par \par \uc2 Like many endangered Republican incumbents, Mr. Denham has danced around whether he supports Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , saying he will work with whoever wins in November. ''I've not weighed into this because I think it's not my place to weigh into it,'' he said.\par \par \uc2 In a column in The Modesto Bee in August, Mr. Denham said that while he was often troubled by Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's comments, the New York developer was the only candidate who had ''at least recognized'' the region's water problem and had selected ''an impressive group'' of potential Supreme Court justices.\par \par \uc2 His opponent, Michael Eggman, a beekeeper, has staked his campaign on tying Mr. Denham to Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 . Walking along the rows of droning bees and almond trees on the farm he inherited from his father, Mr. Eggman gave few policy specifics but did offer a forceful denunciation of Mr. Denham, who beat him by 12 percentage points in 2014.\par \par \uc2 ''To prove the fact that he's so disconnected from this district, he's endorsing \uc2 Trump\uc2  for president,'' Mr. Eggman said. ''\uc2 Trump\uc2  doesn't represent the valley values that I know.''\par \par \uc2 Mr. Denham's refusal to disavow Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  has also put him at odds with the editorial board of The Modesto Bee, the largest newspaper in his district. The paper has endorsed him four times -- most recently in 2014 against Mr. Eggman, who has never held elected office. But after proclaiming, ''If Jeff Denham can't reject \uc2 Trump\uc2 , we must reject him,'' the paper endorsed Mr. Eggman in an editorial that referred to Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  as a ''dangerous demagogue.''\par \par \uc2 Joseph Kieta, the paper's editor, said that Mr. Denham had been motivated by fear of political backlash more than his constituents' best interests.\par \par \uc2 ''I cannot believe that he, in his heart of hearts, thinks that \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2 , who wants to deport Latinos, is good for his district,'' Mr. Kieta said.\par \par \uc2 ''It exposed something about Denham that we didn't know before,'' he added.\par \par \uc2 Follow The \uc2 New York Times\uc2 's politics and Washington coverage on \uc2 Facebook\uc2  and \uc2 Twitter\uc2 , and sign up for the First Draft politics newsletter.\par \par \uc2 Representative Darrell Issa, Republican of California, was first elected to the House in 2000.

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 COLORADO SPRINGS -- Big crowds still mob \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2  when he comes to town, with fans waiting in long lines to attend his rallies, where they eagerly jeer his Democratic rival and holler happily at his message.\par \par \uc2 But beneath the cheering, a new emotion is taking hold among some \uc2 Trump\uc2  supporters as they grapple with reports predicting that he will lose the \uc2 election\uc2 : a dark fear about what will happen if their candidate is denied the White House. Some worry that they will be forgotten, along with their concerns and frustrations. Others believe the nation may be headed for violent conflict.\par \par \uc2 Jared Halbrook, 25, of Green Bay, Wis., said that if Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  lost to \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , which he worried would happen through a stolen \uc2 election\uc2 , it could lead to ''another Revolutionary War.''\par \par \uc2 ''People are going to march on the capitols,'' said Mr. Halbrook, who works at a call center. ''They're going to do whatever needs to be done to get her out of office, because she does not belong there.''\par \par \uc2 ''If push comes to shove,'' he added, and Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  ''has to go by any means necessary, it will be done.''\par \par \uc2 Interviews with more than 50 \uc2 Trump\uc2  supporters at campaign events in six states over the past week revealed a distinct change from the rollicking mood earlier this year, when Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's surprising primary successes and emergence as an unconventional Republican standard-bearer set off broad excitement. The crowds appeared on edge and quick to lash out.\par \par \uc2 And while some voters emphatically disputed polls suggesting that Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  would win, others offered an apocalyptic vision of what life would be like if she did.\par \par \uc2 ''It's not what I'm going to do, but I'm scared that the country is going to go into a riot,'' said Roger Pillath, 75, a retired teacher from Coleman, Wis. ''I've never seen the country so divided, just black and white -- there's no compromise whatsoever. The \uc2 Clinton\uc2  campaign says together we are stronger, but there's no together. The country has never been so divided. I'm looking at revolution right now.''\par \par \uc2 Julie Olson, a rancher who showed up for a rally in Colorado Springs, said that she and her husband had been through rough economic times in recent years, and that a \uc2 Trump\uc2  loss would worsen their burdens.\par \par \uc2 ''I'd probably go into a depression, because life is hard enough for us right now,'' Ms. Olson, 69, said. ''And if Hillary gets in, it's going to be a whole lot worse -- income, lack of income, small business, large businesses.''\par \par \uc2 New York Times\uc2  reporters spoke to people attending \uc2 Trump\uc2  rallies in Colorado, Florida, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. In every crowd, there were supporters who echoed Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's message that the polls did not reflect the ''silent majority'' who they said would turn out on Nov. 8 and elect him in a landslide.\par \par \uc2 ''You go through any neighborhood and see how many \uc2 Trump\uc2  signs there are and how many Hillary signs there are, and I guarantee you it's not even going to be close,'' said Bill Stelling, 44, of Jacksonville, Fla. ''The only way they've done it is by rigging the \uc2 election\uc2 .''\par \par \uc2 An information diet from \uc2 Trump\uc2 -friendly news media like Breitbart News and Infowars has led many to believe that there is no way Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  can lose, and that even contemplating the possibility is foolish. ''I'd be shocked,'' said Rick Hill, 58, of Fort Myers, Fla.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Hill added, ''If you get on social media, he's got Hillary beat, 3 to 1.''\par \par \uc2 But others expressed unease about what a \uc2 Trump\uc2  loss would bring.\par \par \uc2 ''Unfortunately, I'm not a man of vigilante violence,'' said Richard Sabonjohn, 48, of Naples, Fla. ''I'm more of a peaceful person. But I do think there will be a large amount of people that are terribly upset and may take matters into their own hands.''\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  has repeatedly called the \uc2 election\uc2  ''rigged,'' raised concerns about voter fraud and said that he might not accept the results if he lost, making Democrats and Republicans alike worry whether the transfer of power will be smooth.\par \par \uc2 Even some of his supporters who say they would peacefully accept Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  as the next president fear that the nation will take a violent turn -- especially if Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  tries to infringe on Second Amendment rights.\par \par \uc2 Paul Swick, 42, who owns a moving business, went with his wife and daughter to see Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  speak in Green Bay last week. Mr. Swick considers himself a ''Bible Christian'' and ''Thomas Jefferson liberal,'' and said he hoped to beat Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  ''at the ballot box.''\par \par \uc2 But Mr. Swick, by his own estimation, also owns ''north of 30 guns,'' and he said Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  would have trouble if she tried to confiscate the nation's constitutionally protected weapons. (Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  has said she supports the Second Amendment, but she favors certain restrictions, like tighter background checks for gun buyers.)\par \par \uc2 ''If she comes after the guns, it's going to be a rough, bumpy road,'' Mr. Swick said. ''I hope to God I never have to fire a round, but I won't hesitate to. As a Christian, I want reformation. But sometimes reformation comes through bloodshed.''\par \par \uc2 Alan Weegens, 62, a retired truck driver in Colorado Springs, also wondered aloud how the country -- with so many citizens who own guns and, he said, ''are willing to trample a grandma on Black Friday at midnight to save $5 on a toaster'' -- would react if Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  lost.\par \par \uc2 ''I am not going to take my weapon to go out into the streets to protest an \uc2 election\uc2  I did not win,'' Mr. Weegens said, ''but I think that if certain events came about, a person would need to protect themselves, depending on where they lived, when your neighborhood goes up in flames.''\par \par \uc2 Asked what might cause such a conflagration, he pointed to places like Ferguson, Mo., and Charlotte, N.C., which have been hit by unrest after police shootings of black men, and said, ''Because hungry people get mean.''\par \par \uc2 As Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  pulls away in many polls, some \uc2 Trump\uc2  voters found it difficult even to contemplate what a \uc2 Clinton\uc2  presidency would be like for them.\par \par \uc2 ''I'd go home and cry for four years,'' said Ken Herrmann, 69, of Punta Gorda, Fla.\par \par \uc2 Kathy Maney, 61, a hairstylist from Fletcher, N.C., used the language of love lost. ''I won't feel hatred or mad or anything like that, but my heart will be broken,'' she said.\par \par \uc2 And Vicki Sanger, 40, of Grand Junction, Colo., said she had more practical concerns. ''I would just be scared that Hillary would be impeached before she finishes her term,'' she said.\par \par \uc2 But, Ms. Sanger added, she will accept the outcome on \uc2 Election\uc2  Day. ''I would absolutely respect the result and support the next president,'' she said. ''Pray for the next president, whoever it is.''\par \par \uc2 Find out what you need to know about the 2016 presidential race today, and get politics news updates via \uc2 Facebook\uc2 , \uc2 Twitter\uc2  and the First Draft newsletter.\par \par \uc2 Roger Pillath, a \uc2 Trump\uc2  backer in Wisconsin, is ''scared that the country is going to go into a riot.''

\par\par \uc2 National Desk; SECTA\par \b \uc2 Pennsylvania Poll Tells of \uc2 Trump\uc2 's Challenge\b0\par\par\uc2 By NATE COHN \par \uc2 844 \uc2 words\par \uc2 28 October 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 14\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 If \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2  has a path to the presidency with big gains among white working-class voters, it has to run through Pennsylvania -- a disproportionately white, blue-collar state with few Hispanic voters.\par \par \uc2 But a New York Times Upshot/Siena College poll released Thursday indicates that Pennsylvania remains out of reach for Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  leads him by seven percentage points, 46 percent to 39 percent, in a four-way race. And in a contest that could decide control of the Senate, the Republican senator Pat Toomey trails the Democratic challenger Katie McGinty by three points.\par \par \uc2 A late push to win Pennsylvania has become a quadrennial and frustrating feature for Republicans in American presidential elections. The Democrats have won Pennsylvania in six straight presidential elections, but sometimes by only slim margins.\par \par \uc2 The state is full of old industrial cities like Scranton or Johnstown where Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's message on trade would seem to play well. And the turnout among white voters slipped in those areas in 2012, leading many to speculate that disaffected voters would respond to a conservative populist.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's message does seem to be playing well among the white working-class voters that Republicans have coveted for a decade. Over all, he leads among white voters without a college degree by a 17-point margin, 51 percent to 34 percent. It's better than Mr. Romney's 12-point victory with that group in the state in 2012, according to Upshot estimates. Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  appears to be especially strong in northeastern Pennsylvania, including the Scranton and Wilkes-Barre area. And Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  is winning 18 percent of white registered Democrats.\par \par \uc2 But these gains would not be sufficient for Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  to win the state, even if he matched \uc2 Mitt Romney\uc2 's standing among other voters -- something he is not pulling off.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  has the support of just 76 percent of Republican voters and trails among white voters with a college degree by nine points, 47 percent to 38 percent. He has nearly no support among black and other nonwhite voters.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  has claimed in recent weeks that the \uc2 election\uc2  might be rigged because of fraudulent voting in Philadelphia. There is no evidence to support his assertion, but the poll suggests that the Democrats will again pull off a huge victory in the city. Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  has a 76-9 lead in Philadelphia, putting her on track to approach or match President Obama's 85-14 percent margin from 2012.\par \par \uc2 Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's 90-1 lead among black voters suggests she could win a unanimous share of the vote in some precincts in west and north Philadelphia.\par \par \uc2 The Senate race, though, looks more like a traditional Pennsylvania contest. Mr. Toomey has the support of 85 percent of self-identified Republicans. He is doing better than Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  in the Philadelphia suburbs, but not as well as Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  in traditionally Democratic parts of northeastern Pennsylvania.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  and Mr. Toomey do have one thing going for them: strength among voters who have a reliable track record of voting. According to our estimates, the two both lead among the category of voters deemed likeliest to vote. Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's lead among the likeliest voters might help him avoid a larger loss, but it also suggests that he won't be able to count on a pool of missing white voters he hoped to lure to the polls.\par \par \uc2 Over all, Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  has a nine-point lead among registered voters, even larger than her seven-point edge among likely voters.\par \par \uc2 The good news for Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  is that her supporters were just as likely as Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's supporters to say they would turn out to vote, despite their weaker track record of voting. If they do make it to the voting booth, Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  could post an even larger victory.\par \par \uc2 Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  has an 18-point lead among voters who did not participate in the 2012 \uc2 election\uc2 , according to our estimates, which are based on a combination of the poll results and voter file data. She fares even better among white voters who didn't vote in 2012 than she does among white voters who did. It's a pattern that has been true across all of the Upshot/Siena surveys in Florida, North Carolina and Pennsylvania.\par \par \uc2 There has not been an influx of new voters who might help Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 . According to our estimates, Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  has a 16-point lead among newly registered voters. That's in no small part because Democrats have a 10-point registration edge among voters who have registered this year, but it's also because those registering are disproportionately young and urban.\par \par \uc2 Even in a state that is disproportionately older and white, the demographic shifts are still helping the Democrats.\par \par \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  supporters in Pennsylvania, where she leads by seven points in a New York Times Upshot/Siena College poll.

\par\par \uc2 National Desk; SECTA\par \b \uc2 A Gender War Erupts in the G.O.P. as Some Women Draw a Line at \uc2 Trump\b0\par\par\uc2 By TRIP GABRIEL \par \uc2 1,142 \uc2 words\par \uc2 28 October 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 14\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2  has polarized men and women, with the sexes parting ways to such a degree that \uc2 Election\uc2  Day could produce the biggest gender gap in decades.\par \par \uc2 And now that division is being amplified by a gender war in the Republican Party itself. Men and women are taking sides over accusations of Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's mistreatment of women, with the latest controversy a blistering exchange between \uc2 Newt Gingrich\uc2  and Megyn Kelly of Fox News.\par \par \uc2 Increasing numbers of Republican women have turned on their party's male leaders for defending Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  against accusations that he groped or forcibly kissed more than 10 women. Many are complaining publicly that for years, they stood up for the party against Democrats who accused it of pursuing a ''war on women.'' They are unable to do so any longer, they say, and they see hypocrisy in Republican men rallying behind Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  after the same leaders for years accused former President \uc2 Bill \uc2 Clinton\uc2  of predatory behavior.\par \par \uc2 ''These are spineless men,'' said Brittany Pounders, a Republican activist and political blogger from Houston.\par \par \uc2 The latest \uc2 CBS News\uc2  poll, released last week, found that \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  held a 19-percentage-point lead over Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  among women likely to vote. Among Republican women, 79 percent supported Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 . That was far below the 93 percent of Republican women who voted for \uc2 Mitt Romney\uc2  in 2012.\par \par \uc2 With Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  favored among men by an average of seven percentage points in recent polls, this year's gender gap in how men and women vote could be the most yawning since 1952, when it was 26 points.\par \par \uc2 Republican strategists with an expertise in reaching women are anxious that Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's candidacy will damage the party's ability to appeal to them for years to come.\par \par \uc2 ''I think we'll see a lot of women walk away from the party over this,'' said Katie Packer, who was Mr. Romney's deputy campaign manager. ''What you're seeing is 20 years, 30 years of frustration coming together and really, really compounded in the last couple of weeks.''\par \par \uc2 Ms. Packer, a partner in a consulting company that specializes in reaching women on behalf of Republican candidates, said that women in her party were fed up that male leaders were trying to justify ''what we see as criminal behavior'' by Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  toward the women who have accused him of touching them inappropriately.\par \par \uc2 ''Men on our team don't get how serious this is,'' she said. ''I think we're all kind of disgusted that they don't get that.''\par \par \uc2 In regions of battleground states with many college-educated Republican women, such as Northern Virginia and the Philadelphia suburbs, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  is in peril with these voters long loyal to the party.\par \par \uc2 On Tuesday night, Ms. Kelly, repeatedly a thorn in Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's side over his statements about women and his treatment of them, pressed Mr. Gingrich about accusations that the Republican presidential nominee had groped women and forcibly kissed them. Many of the women came forward after Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  boasted of just such behavior in a leaked recording from 2005.\par \par \uc2 ''You are fascinated with sex and you don't care about public policy,'' Mr. Gingrich, the former House speaker, told Ms. Kelly.\par \par \uc2 Ms. Kelly pushed back. ''I'm not fascinated by sex, but I am fascinated by the protection of women and understanding what we're getting in the Oval Office,'' she said.\par \par \uc2 As the exchange went viral, reactions on social media in many cases showed a divide between Republican men and women. ''There is a hot gender war underway,'' Nicolle Wallace, a White House communications director for President George W. Bush, wrote on \uc2 Twitter\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Mr. Gingrich, many noted caustically, was a poor scold on the issue of sexual conduct, given his history of having had an affair with a young congressional aide, who became his third wife, while he was still married to wife No. 2.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  took Mr. Gingrich's side on Wednesday. Pointing to him at an event in Washington, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  said: ''Congratulations, Newt, on last night -- that was an amazing interview. We don't play games, Newt, right? We don't play games.''\par \par \uc2 Some Republican women are now openly organizing to support Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 ''Being a Republican woman is very different from being a Democratic woman,'' said Jennifer Pierotti Lim, who leads a group called Republican Women for Hillary. ''This sentiment that \uc2 Newt Gingrich\uc2  was speaking to -- if you're a woman, you shouldn't be offended by these things, you just should think about the issues -- that's pervasive.''\par \par \uc2 Ms. Lim, a former official at the Chamber of Commerce in Washington, helped found Republican Women for Hillary after being appalled that Senator Mitch McConnell, the majority leader, and Representative Paul D. Ryan, the House speaker, backed Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  this spring. ''I was horrified that our Republican leaders, who I looked up to, endorsed \uc2 Trump\uc2  in the midst of his worst comments about women,'' she said.\par \par \uc2 Ms. Lim spoke at the Democratic convention in July and has traveled to several states as a \uc2 Clinton\uc2  surrogate. Her group claims a network of 75 leaders and volunteers in nine states. She said many disenchanted Republican women were not on board with Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , though they have disavowed Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 One of them is Wendy Lynn Day, who was pushed out of a leadership role at the Michigan Republican Party last week after refusing to endorse Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 . She criticized her party's male leaders, saying that in past years, they had proclaimed that morality and character mattered in a president, but that they were ignoring that principle when it came to Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 ''When we stood up and voiced our concerns about \uc2 Bill \uc2 Clinton\uc2  taking advantage of a young intern and allegedly abusing all of those women, we were standing on the moral high ground,'' Ms. Day said. ''We gave away some of that moral high ground by the way we treated the women who've come forward with allegations about \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2 .''\par \par \uc2 ''When your leaders come out and make excuses and use biblical analogies to defend and promote \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2 ,'' she added, ''that to me crosses a line I'm not comfortable with.''\par \par \uc2 She said she could not vote for Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 . Many women in her situation, she surmised, would support a third-party candidate. Or they would stay home.\par \par \uc2 Find out what you need to know about the 2016 presidential race today, and get politics news updates via \uc2 Facebook\uc2 , \uc2 Twitter\uc2  and the First Draft newsletter.\par \par \uc2 A \uc2 Trump\uc2  rally Wednesday in Kinston, N.C.

\par\par \uc2 National Desk; SECTA\par \b \uc2 Trump\uc2  Team Dismisses Report That It's Aiming for 'Voter Suppression'\b0\par\par\uc2 By MAGGIE HABERMAN and JEREMY W. PETERS \par \uc2 1,000 \uc2 words\par \uc2 28 October 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 16\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's campaign set off a wave of concern about its tactics on Thursday after a senior campaign official was quoted describing a sophisticated ''voter suppression'' effort, a term that usually connotes aggressive attempts to keep people from polling places.\par \par \uc2 The anxiety among Republicans outside the \uc2 Trump\uc2  campaign was set off by a report in Businessweek in which the unidentified official used the term to describe the team's approach to three core groups of \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's supporters.\par \par \uc2 The report came after weeks of diatribes from Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  questioning the basic integrity of the \uc2 election\uc2 . At a rally on Thursday afternoon, he joked that the \uc2 election\uc2  should be called off and he should be crowned the winner.\par \par \uc2 '''We have three major voter suppression operations underway,' says a senior official,'' the Businessweek report said. ''They're aimed at three groups \uc2 Clinton\uc2  needs to win overwhelmingly: idealistic white liberals, young women, and African-Americans.''\par \par \uc2 ''Voter suppression'' often refers to activities, legal and illegal, aimed at preventing eligible voters from casting ballots, such as by passing out fliers containing the wrong date for an \uc2 election\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 But the Businessweek report went on to explain tactics that are more aptly described as efforts aimed at depressing a rival's turnout, such as informing black voters of Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's comment in 1994, while her husband pushed for a bill to reduce urban crime, describing some black teenagers as ''superpredators.''\par \par \uc2 The report contained no examples of the more aggressive efforts that the phrase ''voter suppression'' usually describes.\par \par \uc2 ''What it appears the quote is describing is an attempt to discourage certain demographic groups from turning out in large numbers,'' said Jason Torchinsky, a Republican \uc2 election\uc2  lawyer.\par \par \uc2 ''For lawyers and judges,'' Mr. Torchinsky said, ''these terms usually invoke memories of actions such as placing armed individuals outside polling places or sending letters telling legal voters that if they vote, they will go to jail.''\par \par \uc2 Jason Miller, a spokesman for Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , insisted that the Businessweek report did not accurately reflect the campaign's approach. ''Whoever described it as such either a) doesn't know what they're talking about or b) just isn't dialed in to our campaign and what Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  is trying to accomplish,'' he said.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's own language about the \uc2 election\uc2  has raised concerns among Democrats and some Republican \uc2 election\uc2  lawyers. He has repeatedly said that there was evidence that the outcome would be ''rigged'' and has urged his supporters to monitor urban polling places after they vote, a suggestion that some say could lead his followers to enter the sites illegally and intimidate minority voters.\par \par \uc2 His language prompted the \uc2 Democratic National Committee\uc2  to file court papers this week asking to extend a decades-old consent decree barring the \uc2 Republican National Committee\uc2  from using tactics that could prevent people from voting. The \uc2 Trump\uc2  campaign is not bound by that consent decree, but his team works in tandem with the party committee.\par \par \uc2 Aides to Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  and an official with the \uc2 Democratic National Committee\uc2  did not respond to requests for comment about the \uc2 Trump\uc2  team's remarks. A spokesman for the Justice Department declined to comment.\par \par \uc2 It is highly unusual for a campaign official to boast of using ''voter suppression.'' Still, there is little indication that the \uc2 Trump\uc2  campaign is doing anything more sophisticated or aggressive than using legal, if controversial, means to try to keep Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's supporters from being motivated to vote.\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 Trump\uc2  team recently began a six-figure national ad campaign on urban radio stations, highlighting Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's use of the word ''superpredators.''\par \par \uc2 ''Why would \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  call our children superpredators?'' the ad's narrator asks, adding that Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  is ''attacking our community.''\par \par \uc2 ''\uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  should be ashamed, using racially charged words describing black children as superpredators,'' the narrator says, adding that Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  will rebuild the community ''using our labor, our spirit, our soul.''\par \par \uc2 Campaign aides for Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  have talked in recent weeks about their efforts to discourage turnout for Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 While his aides insist publicly that victory is in sight, the approach represents a tacit admission that Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , who has run a highly divisive and negative campaign and is viewed unfavorably by large percentages of minority and female voters, cannot expand his own vote total in a meaningful way.\par \par \uc2 The campaign's goal is to make Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's vulnerabilities appear so disqualifying that her supporters should never consider voting for her.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's attacks over the past several weeks have included suggesting that Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  uses drugs and linking her husband, former President \uc2 Bill \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , to a decades-old rape allegation. A television commercial showed her coughing and stumbling and questioned whether she had the physical stamina to be president.\par \par \uc2 Much of the strategy, as described by a senior \uc2 Trump\uc2  aide who requested anonymity to divulge the campaign's internal plans, involves linking Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  to her husband's history of infidelity. More broadly, the campaign hopes it can taint her by reminding people of scandals in the couple's past. And when it can, it has tried to tie Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  to the shaming of some of the women who say they had affairs with Mr. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 The approach, the strategists believe, could be useful among millennial voters who used to support Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont and are now unsure about Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 But Democrats and some Republicans do not believe the efforts will erode Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's leads.\par \par \uc2 Find out what you need to know about the 2016 presidential race today, and get politics news updates via \uc2 Facebook\uc2 , \uc2 Twitter\uc2  and the First Draft newsletter.\par \par \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2  on Thursday in Toledo, Ohio. A report quoted a top campaign official describing a ''voter suppression'' effort, but it did not specify any illegal or aggressive tactics.

Narrated by Neil deGrasse Tyson, the film explores mysterious dark matter and dark energy, and the ways scientists are working to improve their understanding of these phenomena. Every half-hour from 10:30 a.m. to 4 p.m. on weekdays, to 5 p.m. on weekends, Central Park West and 79th Street, 212-769-5200, amnh.org.\par \par \uc2 BROOKLYN HISTORICAL SOCIETY\uc2 : 'TRUMAN CAPOTE'S BROOKLYN: THE LOST PHOTOGRAPHS OF DAVID ATTIE' (continuing) Behind this new exhibition -- 40 photographs of Capote and Brooklyn Heights taken by David Attie in 1958 -- is the story of a son's rediscovery of his father's long-lost work. Mr. Attie died in 1982, when his sons were very young. One of them, the television writer Eli Attie, has spent the last few years exploring his father's archive for the first time; in the process he found photos his father had taken to accompany the Truman Capote essay ''A House on the Heights,'' which appeared in Holiday magazine in February 1959. Few of the photos were published, and the magazine included none of the Capote portraits. Now they are on view in an intimate show that feels like both a celebration of and an elegy for an unrefined Brooklyn that once earned the provocative opening line in Capote's essay: ''I live in Brooklyn. By choice.'' 128 Pierrepont Street, near \uc2 Clinton\uc2  Street, Brooklyn Heights, 718-222-4111, brooklynhistory.org.\par \par \uc2 INTREPID SEA, AIR & SPACE MUSEUM: 'ON THE LINE: INTREPID AND THE VIETNAM WAR' (through Oct. 2, 2017) Visitors familiar with this museum are likely to be well aware of its flight deck, perhaps even some of its wartime history. During the Vietnam War, the Intrepid served three tours overseas between 1966 and 1969. Now, in an exhibition set in the space where crew members lived and worked, the museum tells their stories with artifacts, film clips and photographs. Pier 86, 46th Street and 12th Avenue, \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , 877-957-7447, intrepidmuseum.org.\par \par \uc2 NEW YORK PUBLIC LIBRARY\uc2 : '\uc2 ALEXANDER HAMILTON\uc2 : STRIVER, STATESMAN, SCOUNDREL' (through Dec. 31) It's the New York Public Library's turn to take advantage of ''Hamilton''-mania. This exhibition, made from the library's collection, provides some answers to that question posed at the beginning of Lin-Manuel Miranda's hit musical about the ''founding father without a father,'' \uc2 Alexander Hamilton\uc2 : ''How does a bastard, orphan, son of a whore and a Scotsman, dropped in the middle of a forgotten spot in the Caribbean by providence, impoverished, in squalor, grow up to be a hero and a scholar?'' Stephen A. Schwarzman Building, New York Public Library, 917-275-6975, nypl.org/locations/schwarzman.\par \par \uc2 NEW YORK PUBLIC LIBRARY\uc2  FOR THE PERFORMING ARTS: 'CURTAIN UP: CELEBRATING THE LAST 40 YEARS OF THEATER IN NEW YORK AND LONDON' (through June) This season, the Olivier Awards turn 40, and the Tony Awards celebrate their 70th anniversary. \uc2 The New York Public Library\uc2  is using these milestones as inspiration for this exhibition -- in partnership with the \uc2 Society of London Theater\uc2  and the \uc2 Victoria and Albert Museum\uc2  -- about theater works that have won both Oliviers and Tonys. (Expect to see ''The Phantom of the Opera''; ''A Chorus Line''; and Lin-Manuel Miranda's first hit, ''In the Heights.'') The library is also hosting a series of singalongs, talks and other events while the exhibition is on view; among the options for the coming week is a screening of ''Every Little Step,'' Adam Del Deo and James D. Stern's surprisingly poignant 2009 documentary about mounting the 2006 revival of ''A Chorus Line'' on Broadway (Thursday at 6 p.m.). 111 Amsterdam Avenue, at 65th Street, Lincoln Center, 917-275-6975, nypl.org/lpa.\par \par \uc2 'SEE HOW THEY RAN! F.D.R. AND HIS OPPONENTS: CAMPAIGN TREASURES FROM THE \uc2 NEW-YORK HISTORICAL SOCIETY\uc2 ' (through Nov. 30) This \uc2 election\uc2  exhibition highlights the ''new media'' of Franklin D. Roosevelt's era. We have \uc2 Twitter\uc2  and Snapchat selfies; voters in the 1930s and '40s had campaign buttons and radio broadcasts. The show includes those political oldies, along with broadsides, popular music and posters, including one with a vivid original painting by the artist Ben Shahn. Roosevelt House Public Policy Institute at Hunter College, 47-49 East 65th Street, between Madison and Park Avenues, Upper East Side, 212-650-3174, roosevelthouse.hunter.cuny.edu, free.\par \par \uc2 Events\par \par \uc2 ARCHTOBER (through Monday) Tours, talks, exhibitions -- it's difficult to keep track of all the events going on during New York's annual monthlong celebration of architecture and design. Each day features a building of the day, with a tour. Make reservations early; coveted tours sell out quickly. Among the final options is the Battery's redesign by Quennell Rothschild & Partners (Sunday at noon). Other highlights include ''Pumpkitecture!,'' an architecture-minded pumpkin-carving competition that welcomes puns like ''Marcel Booeuer'' (6 p.m. on Friday, at the Center for Architecture, 536 LaGuardia Place in Greenwich Village). More information at archtober.org.\par \par \uc2 CIDER WEEK (Friday and Saturday) It's time to celebrate this seasonal specialty. Apple cider is pressed from a wide variety of apples, with flavor that reflects -- just like wine -- the land it came from. It is also tannic and can be sparkled. Learn more about craft cider, whose fans will tell you it's nothing like beer, in this citywide series of events and tastings. The lineup is at ciderweeknyc.com.\par \par \uc2 NEW YORK TASTE (Tuesday) You definitely want to arrive at this annual food festival with an empty stomach. More than 40 restaurants, chefs and mixologists will offer all-you-can-handle samples of their culinary creations. Among the chefs are Dan Barber, of Blue Hill at Stone Barns, and Jessica Weiss of Marta and Maialino. The full lineup is at taste.nymag.com. From 6 to 9 p.m., the Waterfront, 269 11th Avenue, between 27th and 28th Streets, Chelsea.\par \par \uc2 WINTER VILLAGE AT BRYANT PARK (Saturday through Jan. 2) It's that time of year again: Bryant Park's pristine lawn has been converted into an outdoor market of snacks and holiday bric-a-brac -- as well as, of course, an ice-skating rink (which remains open through March 5). More information about the vendors and a calendar of events are at wintervillage.org. Avenue of the Americas, at 40th Street.\par \par \uc2 Spoken Word\par \par \uc2 MARINA ABRAMOVIC AND DEBBIE HARRY (Friday) \uc2 The New York Public Library\uc2 's Live From the NYPL series continues with Ms. Abramovic, one of the pre-eminent performance artists and the author of the newly released memoir ''Walk Through Walls.'' She will be joined in conversation by Ms. Harry -- yes, that Debbie Harry -- the pop culture icon of Blondie fame who was inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame in 2006. At 7 p.m., Stephen A. Schwarzman Building, New York Public Library, 917-275-6975, nypl.org/locations/schwarzman.\par \par \uc2 CARRIE BROWNSTEIN AND GEORGE SAUNDERS (Tuesday) The latest taping of ''Selected Shorts,'' a podcast in which actors read the works of writers, features Ms. Brownstein (''Portlandia'') in partnership with the short-story master George Saunders (''Tenth of December''). Additional performers include Josh Radnor (''How I Met Your Mother'') and Denis O'Hare (''American Horror Story''). At 7:30 p.m., Symphony Space, 2537 Broadway, at 95th Street, 212-864-5400, symphonyspace.org.\par \par \uc2 A CITY AND A CHURCH: THE REMARKABLE HISTORY OF ST. PAUL'S CHAPEL AND THE STREETS BEYOND THE DOORS (Sunday) This weekend is the 250th anniversary of St. Paul's Chapel, a history-rich house of worship that survived both the Revolutionary War and the attacks of Sept. 11. (The tiny church is across the street from the World Trade Center site.) Learn more about the history of St. Paul's at this talk with Kenneth Jackson, a professor of history and social sciences at Columbia University. At 4:15 p.m., Broadway at Fulton Street, Lower Manhattan, trinitywallstreet.org, free.\par \par \uc2 #FERRANTENIGHTFEVER (Tuesday through Nov. 5) Elena Ferrante -- the mysterious, pseudonymous Italian writer who may have been unmasked recently by the journalist Claudio Gatti -- releases two new books in the United States next week: ''Frantumaglia: A Writer's Journey,'' a collection of interviews and essays, and the grim picture book ''The Beach at Night.'' To celebrate, and to pay homage to Ms. Ferrante's kaleidoscopic Neapolitan novels, more than 70 bookstores are hosting book parties and talks on a scale usually reserved for Harry Potter releases. Among them are a discussion with the authors Roxana Robinson and Ayana Mathis, as well as Dayna Tortorici of N+1 and Ann Goldstein, who translated the Neapolitan novels. It will be moderated by Michael Reynolds, the editor in chief of Ms. Ferrante's American publisher, Europa Editions (Tuesday at 7 p.m., at McNally Jackson, 52 Prince Street, between Lafayette and Mulberry Streets, SoHo, 212-274-1160). Additional events are at europaeditions.com/ferrantenightfever.\par \par \uc2 Walking Tours\par \par \uc2 BROADWAY UP CLOSE: 'ACT I' (daily) Broadway Up Close's flagship tour takes participants through the history of Manhattan's theater district, from its origins in the 1880s to this season's hits. Highlights include 42nd Street itself, ghost stories and theaters where history was made -- including the Nederlander, where the tour begins and where the musical ''Rent'' introduced changes (like ticket lotteries) that remain popular today. At 11 a.m., beginning at 208 West 41st Street, Manhattan, 917-841-0187, broadwayupclose.com. Reservations are required.\par \par \uc2 GRAVESTONES AND GOTH (Saturday) This tour of the Bartow-Pell Mansion Museum includes a stroll through its grave site, accompanied by the true story of Goodwife Pell and the role she played in a 1650s witchcraft trial. Inside the mansion's parlors, cast members of the coming production of ''Sweeney Todd'' by the City Island Theater Group will read scary and supernatural stories. At 6 p.m., 895 Shore Road North, Pelham Bay Park, the Bronx, 718-885-1461, bartowpellmansionmuseum.org.\par \par \uc2 (PHOTOGRAPHS BY MARIA BJORNSON ARCHIVE; PATRICIA ZIPPRODT) \par \par \uc2 Document NYTF000020161028ecas0006o\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

Sharing the bill is the baritone saxophonist Hamiet Bluiett, joined by the tenor saxophonist James Brandon Lewis, the pianist D.D. Jackson, the bassist Luke Stewart and the drummer Reggie Nicholson. At 8 p.m., Community Church of New York, 40 East 35th Street, Manhattan, 800-838-3006, aacm-newyork.com. (Nate Chinen)\par \par \uc2 'THE AMERICAN SLAVE COAST: LIVE' (Friday) ''The American Slave Coast: A History of the Slave-Breeding Industry,'' by Ned and Constance Sublette, is a sweeping social history that doubles as a provocation, very much in tune with some current cultural discourse. This evening will translate its prose into music, with readings not only by the authors, who are married, but also Jonathan Demme, Nona Hendryx, Carl Hancock Rux and others -- and actual musical accompaniment by a jazz hero from New Orleans, the saxophonist and composer Donald Harrison. At 8 p.m., Symphony Space, 2537 Broadway at 95th Street, 212-864-5400, symphonyspace.org. (Chinen)\par \par \uc2 JAY CLAYTON QUINTET: 75TH BIRTHDAY BASH (Friday and Saturday) The singer Jay Clayton, who begins this run on her birthday, has made a career out of bridging the standard songbook and the avant-garde, with style. On Saturday she will work with a rhythm section consisting of John DiMartino on piano, Dean Johnson on bass and Jerry Granelli on drums. At 8 and 10 p.m., Jazz at Kitano, 66 Park Avenue, at 38th Street, 212-885-7119, kitano.com. (Chinen)\par \par \uc2 CHICK COREA AT THE BLUE NOTE (through Sunday, Wednesday through Dec. 12, with some exceptions) Mr. Corea recently turned 75, and decided to celebrate with a big gesture: an eight-week club engagement, with a highlight reel of bands. This weekend he closes out a stretch with For Miles, an all-star, multi-era tribute to Miles Davis. Next Wednesday and Thursday he revisits the music from his 1981 album ''Three Quartets,'' leading a band with Ben Solomon on saxophones, Eddie Gomez on bass and Steve Gadd on drums. For a full schedule, visit bluenote.net. At 8 and 10:30 p.m., Blue Note, 131 West Third Street, Greenwich Village, 212-475-8592, bluenote.net. (Chinen)\par \par \uc2 \u9733\'26\'05 LOU DONALDSON QUARTET: LOU AT 90 (Tuesday) The alto saxophonist Lou Donaldson, who does indeed turn 90 on Tuesday, could be forgiven for coasting on his contributions to hard bop and soul jazz. But if he isn't the quicksilver force he once was on the horn, he's no less an entertainer and aphorist, and he has strong support in his band, who should have no problem with a festive agenda. At 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., Dizzy's Club \uc2 Coca-Cola\uc2 , Frederick P. Rose Hall, Jazz at Lincoln Center, 60th Street and Broadway, 212-258-9595, jazz.org/dizzys. (Chinen)\par \par \uc2 \u9733\'26\'05 KURT ELLING (Friday and Saturday) Mr. Elling is a jazz vocalist with range -- a shape-shifter equally capable of Mark Murphy-esque insouciance, Jon Hendricks-like ingenuity and even the expressive restraint of Frank Sinatra in his concept-album years. This engagement will partly serve as a preview taste of his first holiday album, ''The Beautiful Day,'' due out this month. At 8:30 and 11 p.m., Birdland, 315 West 44th Street, \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , 212-581-3080, birdlandjazz.com. (Chinen)\par \par \uc2 \u9733\'26\'05 CHARLIE HADEN'S LIBERATION MUSIC ORCHESTRA CONDUCTED BY CARLA BLEY (Thursday through Nov. 6) This revolutionary big band has soldiered on, to one degree or another, since the death of its founder, the great bassist Charlie Haden, in 2014. Solely led now by his longtime collaborator Carla Bley, the band has a fine new album, ''Time/Life,'' named after a tender dirge she wrote in his memory. And it's no coincidence that the band, stocked with aces like the saxophonists Loren Stillman and Tony Malaby, sets up shop in the lead-up to \uc2 Election\uc2  Day. At 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan, 212-576-2232, jazzstandard.com. (Chinen)\par \par \uc2 \u9733\'26\'05 THE JAZZ AGE: UNTAMED ELEGANCE (Friday through Sunday) This weekend-long exercise in swinging time travel, jointly presented by Jazz at Lincoln Center and the New York Hot Jazz Festival, has top bands in the field mining discrete historical periods. Highlights include Dan Levinson's Roof Garden Jazz Band, evoking the Original Dixieland Jass Band (Friday at 7:30 p.m.); Vince Giordano and the Nighthawks, tackling King Oliver and Jelly Roll Morton (Saturday at 7:30 p.m.); and the Ghost Train Orchestra, in a program called ''The Unsung Composers of Harlem and Chicago Jazz at the Height of the Prohibition'' (Sunday at 7:30 p.m.). At Dizzy's Club \uc2 Coca-Cola\uc2 , Frederick P. Rose Hall, Jazz at Lincoln Center, 60th Street and Broadway, 212-258-9595, jazz.org/dizzys. (Chinen)\par \par \uc2 \u9733\'26\'05 JAZZ IN THE KEY OF ELLISON (Tuesday) This jazz tribute to the exalted writer Ralph Ellison -- presented by Audible, whose founder, Donald Katz, saw him as a mentor -- will feature the Andy Farber Orchestra along with Wynton Marsalis and an array of vocalists. Along with the jazz singer Catherine Russell, they include the pop-R&B star Patti Austin, the West African dynamo Ang\u233\'00\'E9lique Kidjo, the rapper Talib Kweli and the actor Joe Morton. At 7:30 p.m., New Jersey Performing Arts Center, 1 Center Street, Newark, 888-466-5722, njpac.org. (Chinen)\par \par \uc2 OKKYUNG LEE (Friday) Ms. Lee is a cellist of exploratory instincts, at home in a purely spontaneous setting. She performs here with a harpist, Maeve Gilchrist, as well as the bassist Eivind Opsvik and the pianist Jacob Sacks. At 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., the Jazz Gallery, 1160 Broadway, Manhattan, 646-494-3625, jazzgallery.org. (Chinen)\par \par \uc2 PEDRITO MARTINEZ GROUP (Monday and Tuesday) Mr. Martinez -- an irrepressible percussionist, vocalist and bandleader upholding the Afro-Cuban tradition in New York -- leads his sharp band in two distinct settings next week. On Monday, which happens to be Halloween, they'll work a spruce small room, Dizzy's Club \uc2 Coca-Cola\uc2 ; on Tuesday they'll appear in the historic Alhambra Ballroom of New York, where there's a dance floor, in a Harlem Shout Fall Benefit Concert for the National Jazz Museum in Harlem. Monday at 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., Dizzy's Club \uc2 Coca-Cola\uc2 , Frederick P. Rose Hall, Jazz at Lincoln Center, 60th Street and Broadway, 212-258-9595, jazz.org/dizzys. Tuesday at 7:30 p.m., 2116 Adam Clayton Powell Jr. Boulevard, Harlem, jazzmuseuminharlem.org. (Chinen)\par \par \uc2 ENRICO PIERANUNZI QUARTET (Through Sunday) Mr. Pieranunzi is one of the leading jazz pianists in Italy, a careful rhapsodist with a more than casual appreciation of the Bill Evans style. He works often with American partners and has a good crew for this engagement: the tenor saxophonist Seamus Blake, the bassist Scott Colley and the drummer Clarence Penn. At 8:30 and 10:30 p.m., Village Vanguard, 178 Seventh Avenue South, at 11th Street, West Village, 212-255-4037, villagevanguard.com. (Chinen)\par \par \uc2 RENEE ROSNES QUARTET (Tuesday through Nov. 6) Ms. Rosnes has a new album, ''Written in the Rocks,'' that confirms her stature not only as a first-rate pianist but also as a thoughtful and lyrical composer. She appears with the vibraphonist Steve Nelson, the bassist Peter Washington and the drummer Lenny White. At 8:30 and 10:30 p.m., Village Vanguard, 178 Seventh Avenue South, at 11th Street, West Village, 212-255-4037, villagevanguard.com. (Chinen)\par \par \uc2 JACOB SACKS QUINTET (Saturday) The pianist Jacob Sacks is what you might call an inner-workings musician, drawn to the subtler, deeper mechanics of harmony and form. He has often worked in small-group settings with the excellent drummer Dan Weiss, who anchors this quintet alongside Michael Formanek on bass. In the front line are two smartly garrulous tenor saxophonists, Ellery Eskelin and Tony Malaby. At 9 and 10:30 p.m., Cornelia Street Caf\u233\'00\'E9, 29 Cornelia Street, Greenwich Village, 212-989-9319, corneliastreetcafe.com. (Chinen)\par \par \uc2 \u9733\'26\'05 LUCIANA SOUZA TRIO (Tuesday and Wednesday) Ms. Souza, originally from S\u227\'00\'E3o Paulo, Brazil, has used her voice as an instrument of empathy and intimacy, cultural linkage and poetic disquisition. Sometimes, too, she has used it as an instrument in a more literal sense -- the main point of her most recent album, ''Speaking in Tongues.'' She's likely to draw on that notion here with two virtuoso colleagues, the guitarist Romero Lubambo and the percussionist Cyro Baptista. At 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan, 212-576-2232, jazzstandard.com. (Chinen)\par \par \uc2 \u9733\'26\'05 ANNA WEBBER'S SIMPLE TRIO (Thursday) ''Simple'' is a relative term, maybe even a sardonic joke, for Ms. Webber, an unrelentingly inventive flutist, tenor saxophonist and composer. She created the compositions on her head-spinning new album, ''Binary,'' using internet resources -- even, at one point, a random-number algorithm -- and entrusting the results to this trio, with Matt Mitchell on piano and John Hollenbeck on drums. They revisit this concept, which works much better as music than as descriptive preamble, under the banner of the Sound It Out series. At 8 p.m., Greenwich House Music School, 46 Barrow Street, West Village, 212-242-4770, greenwichhouse.org. (Chinen)\par \par \uc2 (PHOTOGRAPH BY MICHELLE V.
