\par\par \uc2 National Desk; SECTA\par \b \uc2 In 'Nasty' Turn, \uc2 Clinton\uc2  Unites Generations\b0\par\par\uc2 By FARAH STOCKMAN \par \uc2 1,233 \uc2 words\par \uc2 21 October 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 1\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 In her debate on Wednesday with \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  for the first time emerged as the clarion-voiced advocate for women whom many liberal women had been longing for -- especially the younger voters she had largely left cold throughout the Democratic primaries.\par \par \uc2 Speaking on abortion rights, a defining issue for an older generation of feminists, Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  dispensed with Democrats' longstanding caveat that the procedure should be rare, and strongly defended women's right to control their own bodies without government interference.\par \par \uc2 More tellingly, Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  also seemed to speak to a new generation of women -- and to many young men -- by assailing Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  over sexual assault and harassment, saying his dismissals of the allegations against him by multiple women showed that he ''thinks belittling women makes him bigger.''\par \par \uc2 ''He goes after their dignity, their self-worth,'' Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  said firmly. ''And I don't think there is a woman anywhere who doesn't know what that feels like.''\par \par \uc2 Perhaps the biggest boost she received, however, was one that neither she nor any army of political operatives could have engineered: when Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  interjected, ''What a nasty woman,'' as Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  was discussing Social Security and taxes.\par \par \uc2 Overnight, his insult became a battle cry for Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's partisans -- including many whose passions she had not yet stirred. ''Nasty Woman'' T-shirts began selling on the internet. Naral Pro-Choice America advertised ''NastyWoman'' stickers. A New York City man quickly set up an expletive-laced ''nasty women'' website that redirected visitors to Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's campaign page. Streams of Janet Jackson's 1986 hit ''Nasty'' increased 250 percent on Spotify after the debate, according to a Spotify spokesman. More than 8,000 people had taken up the phrase on \uc2 Twitter\uc2  by midafternoon, wielding it as a badge of honor.\par \par \uc2 A campaign that a day earlier had taken some ribbing over a leaked email showing that top aides churned through a list of more than 80 potential slogans -- many of them plodding and colorless -- suddenly seemed to be taking on the vitality of a grass-roots movement.\par \par \uc2 Even before Wednesday night's debate, Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  had been beating Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  by large margins among probable female voters.\par \par \uc2 Sixty percent supported Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , compared with 24 percent who supported Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , according to a \uc2 CBS\uc2  poll conducted in October, just days after the release of a tape in which Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  could be heard boasting about his ability to get away with sexual assault.\par \par \uc2 But many women seemed motivated as much, or more, by fear of a \uc2 Trump\uc2  presidency as by enthusiasm for Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 ''\uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2 's candidacy has just terrified me from the moment he stepped on the stage,'' said April Alario, 35, a disabled former pastor in Boston.\par \par \uc2 ''He reminded me of every controlling abusive man I've ever encountered,'' added Ms. Alario, who said she had voted Republican in every presidential \uc2 election\uc2  since 2004.\par \par \uc2 On Wednesday night, however, Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  made her case to younger women on subjects that polls show matter most to them: sexual harassment, marriage equality and women's rights.\par \par \uc2 Amanda Silberling, a junior at the \uc2 University of Pennsylvania\uc2  who is a campus advocate against sexual assault, watched the debate with a group of students while making T-shirts that mock Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  over the sexual-assault and harassment allegations against him.\par \par \uc2 Ms. Silberling said she favored Bernie Sanders in the Democratic primary campaign, but that she went from merely opposing Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  to avidly supporting Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  during the debate, as Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  repeatedly took him to task on the issues of sexual assault and abortion rights, including for late-term procedures.\par \par \uc2 ''For women, politics gets complicated when people try to place ownership on what a woman can and can't do with her body,'' she said. ''It does reassure me to have a woman in office who understands what it's like to be a woman.''\par \par \uc2 To older Democratic women, who never took the right to abortion for granted -- and for whom preservation of the 1973 decision in Roe v. Wade is a touchstone -- Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  won a new round of approval Wednesday with her defense of even the late-term procedure denounced by its critics as partial-birth abortion.\par \par \uc2 Not only did she rebuff Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's contention that such abortions ''rip the baby out of the womb of the mother just prior to the birth,'' but Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  upbraided him for using what she called ''scare rhetoric.''\par \par \uc2 Then she availed herself of an argument with conservative roots: ''I've been to countries where governments either forced women to have abortions, like they used to do in China, or forced women to bear children, like they used to do in Romania,'' she said.\par \par \uc2 ''And I can tell you,'' she said, ''the government has no business in the decisions that women make with their families, in accordance with their faith, with medical advice.''\par \par \uc2 Of course, abortion rights is not exclusively a concern for women born before 1980.\par \par \uc2 Chelsea Donaldson, 27, a law school student in Springfield, Mass., who voted for Bernie Sanders in the primary, posted on \uc2 Twitter\uc2  a ''thank you'' to Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  for her remarks on abortion during the debate.\par \par \uc2 Ms. Donaldson said later that she refused to ''go back to the time period of my grandmothers'' when abortion was illegal.\par \par \uc2 ''I was thrilled to see that she not only supported the right to access, but shot down \uc2 Trump\uc2 's ludicrous comments about late-term abortion,'' Ms. Donaldson said by email. She said she felt ''energized'' at how Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  explained the stakes.\par \par \uc2 Still, Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  has struggled to connect with younger voters, who polls show place less of a priority on reproductive rights as an issue -- either because they feel morally conflicted about it or because they take reproductive rights for granted.\par \par \uc2 A 2013 study by the \uc2 Pew Research Center\uc2  showed that 62 percent of Americans ages 18 to 29 said abortion was ''not that important'' compared with other issues.\par \par \uc2 Only 44 percent of Americans under 30 knew what Roe v. Wade was about.\par \par \uc2 By contrast, marriage equality -- a civil rights fight that younger voters lived through, and that many participated in -- resonates much more.\par \par \uc2 Among millennials, 81 percent of Americans aged 18 to 29 said that same-sex couples should be allowed to marry, according to the \uc2 CBS\uc2  poll.\par \par \uc2 And Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  made sure to mention the importance of preserving marriage equality, alongside abortion rights, when she was asked about the criteria she would use to pick judges for the Supreme Court.\par \par \uc2 That meant a lot to Rebecca Bean, 31, of Wisconsin Dells, Wis., whose brother, an Iraq War veteran, is married to a man.\par \par \uc2 ''Knowing that they are not going to lose their rights is important,'' she said.\par \par \uc2 But Ms. Bean, who initially supported Mr. Sanders for president, also has another reason to support Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  in this race.\par \par \uc2 The sexual allegations against Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  have affected her in a personal way, as she made clear in a \uc2 Twitter\uc2  post on Thursday.\par \par \uc2 ''IamANastyWomanBecause I am a survivor of sexual assault,'' she wrote, ''who helps others in unsafe and unhealthy relationships.''\par \par \uc2 Find out what you need to know about the 2016 presidential race today, and get politics news updates via \uc2 Facebook\uc2 , \uc2 Twitter\uc2  and the First Draft newsletter.\par \par \uc2 Document NYTF000020161021ecal0004r\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 ABROAD IN AMERICA\par \uc2 Foreign Desk; SECT\par \b \uc2 Las Vegas, Known for Excess, Was Perfect Backdrop for Presidential Debate\b0\par\par\uc2 By DECLAN WALSH \par \uc2 1,177 \uc2 words\par \uc2 21 October 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 The New York Times on the Web\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 CORRECTION APPENDEDLAS VEGAS -- Outside the Four Queens casino in downtown Las Vegas, just past Elvis and a pregnant burlesque dancer, stood ''Baby Donald'' -- a rotund man in a rubber \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2  mask, wearing a diaper and clutching a giant baby bottle. ''Make diapers great again,'' his T-shirt read.\par \par \uc2 Baby Donald was actually Cary Darling, a 50-year-old father of two working for tips to support his family. It could be risky. While most \uc2 Trump\uc2  supporters were friendly, one spat in his face and another harassed him and urged him to hang himself.\par \par \uc2 Then there was the time a tourist mistook Mr. Darling's character for a political promotion and, after cursing Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , punched him in the face.\par \par \uc2 ''This is a really weird \uc2 election\uc2 ,'' Mr. Darling said.\par \par \uc2 America's political divides can be felt even in the country's sin city, the desert oasis where dazzle and extravagance are a way of life. In a sense, it was Las Vegas's proud reputation for lurid excess, for being a place where almost anything goes, that seemed to make it the perfect backdrop for the third and final American presidential debate, which took place here on Wednesday night.\par \par \uc2 The debate had none of the splashy excess of the casino mega-resorts a few miles away, along the city's million-watt main strip, where one hotel is shaped like an Egyptian pyramid and there is a bewildering choice of shows featuring famous magicians, singers, circus acts and strippers.\par \par \uc2 Yet, in its own way, the event was an apt reflection of America's elaborate process of choosing a president -- an exhausting, 18-month marathon of elections, debates and TV-driven rituals costing hundreds of millions of dollars, now grinding toward its climax with the vote on Nov. 8.\par \par \uc2 The Las Vegas debate cost $8 million to put on and was almost a year in the making, said Valarie Segerra, one of the organizers. The stage had been trucked 2,500 miles across the country to the venue on the \uc2 University of Nevada, Las Vegas\uc2 , campus. Organizers erected three miles of fencing and strategically placed 190 shipping containers to guard against terrorist attacks. Power and internet backup systems had to be provided; 1,000 student volunteers were recruited to guide visitors.\par \par \uc2 The giant arena that hosted the debate had previously held major boxing matches and rodeo competitions. The Commission for Presidential Debates, the nonprofit group that organized the debates, used giant black drapes to set aside a section for this encounter, and it set specific requirements for the climate inside: The temperature had to hover between 63 and 65 degrees, and the humidity had to be less than 50 percent.\par \par \uc2 The debates commission, which has organized every debate since 1988, calibrates every aspect to ensure parity. The same stage used in the first two debates was used in Las Vegas. Anything that could provide a perceived advantage -- who stands left or right on the stage, who walks out first, whether they shake hands -- was previously decided with the candidates through consensus or a coin toss, said Peter Eyre, a commission spokesman.\par \par \uc2 ''We want them to be as equal as possible,'' he said.\par \par \uc2 He declined to comment on the controversy that erupted at the previous debate, in St. Louis, when Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  tried to bring three women who had accused \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's husband, former President \uc2 Bill \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , of sexual misconduct, into the V.I.P. box.\par \par \uc2 The debates, political theater writ large, are part of a proud American tradition that stretches back to 1858, when Abraham Lincoln and Stephen Douglas argued over slavery during a race for a Senate seat from Illinois.\par \par \uc2 With 150,000 hotel rooms and an array of cavernous conference halls, Las Vegas was well equipped to accommodate the thousands of journalists who descended on the city, although it had never previously hosted a presidential debate, or indeed, any national political event. Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  owns 50 percent of a shimmering gold hotel here, now at the heart of a heated labor dispute. (He refuses to recognize the powerful Culinary Workers Union, which is campaigning for Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  in the \uc2 election\uc2 ).\par \par \uc2 After a grinding campaign season, some reporters made the most of the city's attractions. The team from Fox News set up a studio on the rooftop of the MGM Grand, overlooking the strip. On the eve of the debate, the anchor Steve Doocy celebrated his birthday alongside a group of tiara-wearing choral singers. Nearby another reporter was filmed twirling in the pool, still wearing his shirt and tie, surrounded by synchronized swimmers. ''I saw him drinking beer a minute ago,'' Mr. Doocy said. ''Next thing you know he's in an inner tube with these ladies.''\par \par \uc2 In all, over 5,000 journalists traveled to Las Vegas for the debate. They clustered in studios, set up live positions and gathered in a giant hall. \uc2 CNN\uc2  alone had set up three temporary studios, erected six other interview positions and deployed at least 30 cameras.\par \par \uc2 On Wednesday, four hours before the debate started, guests and anchors cycled on and off an outdoor stage on the college campus with an air of practiced familiarity.\par \par \uc2 Behind the TV set was another scene that has become a ritual of political elections: dozens of supporters of the candidates holding aloft giant signs, jostling to be seen in the background of the TV shot. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  supporters wore pink T-shirts for \uc2 Planned Parenthood\uc2 . As the studio guests talked, \uc2 Trump\uc2  supporters yelled, ''\uc2 CNN\uc2  for \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2 ,'' a sarcastic reference to the network, which has been derided by Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  as the \uc2 Clinton\uc2  News Network.\par \par \uc2 When the debate started hours later, at 6 p.m., journalists crowded into a vast hall to write, comment and talk about the event, which had the air of a keenly anticipated theatrical performance. In the press center, 50 televisions hung from the roof, relaying the proceedings.\par \par \uc2 A hush fell over the hall during the debate The silence was broken just a few times, usually when one of the candidates let rip a zinger, like Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's reference to illegal immigrants as ''bad hombres,'' or Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's taunts about his hotel.\par \par \uc2 Yet at the end, instead of applause, there was silence. For once in Vegas, a performance had ended without a reaction.\par \par \uc2 More important was the reaction of the roughly 70 million Americans watching across the country. Mr. Darling, the Baby \uc2 Trump\uc2 , was not among them. Avoiding the debate parties, he stayed home to watch a movie with his sons. He couldn't wait for the vote on Nov. 8, he said Thursday, ''so all of this will finally be over.''\par \par \uc2 Online Correction: October 20, 2016, Thursday\par \par \uc2 This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: Cary Darling was misidentified in an earlier version of a photo caption accompanying this story, as was the casino at which he was photographed.\par \par \uc2 Follow Declan Walsh on Twitter @declanwalsh .\par \par \uc2 Document NYTF000020161021ecal00036\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 To the Editor:\par \par \uc2 Re ''\uc2 Trump\uc2  Won't Say if He Will Accept \uc2 Election\uc2  Results'' (front page, Oct. 20):\par \par \uc2 There are those who are delighted that the three-ring circus -- known in some circles as debates -- is over. Not me. The entertainment value went through the roof. But beyond the entertainment, these debates, more so than those of the past, really displayed the true character of the nominees, and their respective abilities to lead the country in these incredibly difficult times.\par \par \uc2 Yes, it was ugly and at times not much more than a barroom brawl. So what? At the end of the day, we watched a seasoned, experienced, balanced woman trade punch for punch with a nasty, no-holds-barred, unhinged demagogue, and Nov. 8 will determine whom the country prefers.\par \par \uc2 The debates accomplished their mission -- to expose the nominees' true inner beings as well as the credibility of their vision of the present and for the future. It was unrigged democracy at its best.\par \par \uc2 PETER C. ALKALAY\par \par \uc2 Scarsdale, N.Y.\par \par \uc2 To the Editor:\par \par \uc2 At Wednesday night's debate \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  outdid himself with his reckless answer to the basic question: Will you, like every presidential nominee before you, accept the results of the \uc2 election\uc2 ? Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  insisted that we can wait for \uc2 Election\uc2  Day to find out.\par \par \uc2 If you have zero faith in our democracy, you should not be allowed to run it.\par \par \uc2 AUDREY DELLAS\par \par \uc2 Orlando, Fla.\par \par \uc2 To the Editor:\par \par \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  says he will wait until the \uc2 election\uc2  is over before deciding if he agrees with the results. Why shouldn't he?\par \par \uc2 Given the negative onslaught by the media, the outlandish disparagement of his character by \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's vicious campaign of lies, the resistance to him from establishment Republicans and his allegations of rigged elections -- why shouldn't he withhold judgment?\par \par \uc2 OTIS PAGE\par \par \uc2 Arroyo Grande, Calif.\par \par \uc2 To the Editor:\par \par \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  says the \uc2 election\uc2  is rigged before it even happens. If true, it is just as invalid if he wins as it would be if \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  wins.\par \par \uc2 JEFFREY L. FELDMAN\par \par \uc2 Aventura, Fla.\par \par \uc2 To the Editor:\par \par \uc2 I worried if he wins; now I worry if he loses.\par \par \uc2 DANIEL VAN DER WEIDE\par \par \uc2 Madison, Wis.\par \par \uc2 To the Editor:\par \par \uc2 It's ironic that many people continue to argue that \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  hasn't articulated a vision for why she wants to be president.\par \par \uc2 Certainly \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2 's adherents, and much of the Republican establishment, feel strongly that she does have one -- and they don't like it.\par \par \uc2 Those among us who still ask what that vision is will find it in the answers to virtually any question asked of her, as the debates have amply demonstrated.\par \par \uc2 POLK LAFFOON IV\par \par \uc2 Cincinnati\par \par \uc2 To the Editor:\par \par \uc2 Re ''Mixing Humor With Scolding to Defuse Clashes in a Final Substantive Encounter'' (news article, Oct. 20):\par \par \uc2 Mentioning, unnecessarily, how much \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  got paid for her speech at a Brazilian bank may have been a Fox News moment in the debate, but this \uc2 Clinton\uc2  supporter thought that Chris Wallace did a commendable job as moderator. It has not been easy taming this circus of a campaign season.\par \par \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  did not goad or trap \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  as the media keeps insisting. She vanquished Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  by remaining true to herself: an intelligent, thoughtful individual who is committed to public service.\par \par \uc2 STEPHANIE NICHOLAS ACQUADRO\par \par \uc2 Westfield, N.J.\par \par \uc2 To the Editor:\par \par \uc2 Re ''The Debates Were a Failure of Journalism'' (nytimes.com, Oct. 20):\par \par \uc2 David Leonhardt is completely correct in labeling the lack of discussion on climate change during the debates as a failure of journalism. It is also a failure on each of the candidates' parts.\par \par \uc2 Each campaign has spent an inordinate amount of time and energy on the other candidate's scandals. The real scandal is that the most important issue today is apparently not important enough to be discussed in depth or at all on the biggest pre-\uc2 election\uc2  stage.\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 Clinton\uc2  campaign has both privately and publicly wondered why it has failed to mobilize millennials and young people in the manner of Barack Obama or Bernie Sanders. This is why.\par \par \uc2 WILLIAM BURSTEIN\par \par \uc2 Montclair, N.J.\par \par \uc2 Document NYTF000020161021ecal0002w\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 National Desk; SECTA\par \b \uc2 Trump\uc2  Stays Firm on Having Option to Dispute Vote\b0\par\par\uc2 By ALAN RAPPEPORT and ALEXANDER BURNS; Reporting was contributed by Ashley Parker, Amy Chozick, Trip Gabriel and Thomas Kaplan. \par \uc2 1,289 \uc2 words\par \uc2 21 October 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 1\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2  insisted on Thursday that he would not cede the right to contest the outcome of the presidential \uc2 election\uc2 , even as Democrats and Republicans expressed concern that his position threatened to upend America's tradition of peaceful power transfers. But in a small gesture of civility, he suggested that he would not dispute the result if the outcome of the race was clear.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's reluctance to pledge absolutely that he would honor the \uc2 election\uc2  outcome follows a rocky performance in the third and last presidential debate and comes as the candidates set off for the frenzied final stretch of campaigning ahead of the Nov. 8 \uc2 election\uc2 . On Thursday, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  continued to rally his supporters with conspiracy theories about how the race was rigged against him, but he did make clear that there was one result that he would not challenge under any circumstance.\par \par \uc2 ''I will totally accept the results of this great and historic presidential \uc2 election\uc2  -- if I win,'' Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  said to cheers at a rally in Delaware, Ohio.\par \par \uc2 Saying that George W. Bush might have lost the 2000 \uc2 election\uc2  to Al Gore if he had made a pre-\uc2 election\uc2  pledge not to challenge results, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  said he would not take that option off the table. He did, however, try to ease concerns that he was planning to throw the country into postelection turmoil.\par \par \uc2 ''Of course I would accept a clear \uc2 election\uc2  result, but I would also reserve my right to contest or file a legal challenge in the case of a questionable result,'' Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , appearing to accept the possibility of defeat, said. ''I will follow and abide by all the rules and traditions of all of the many candidates who came before me, always.''\par \par \uc2 He added, ''Bottom line, we're going to win.''\par \par \uc2 Polls show Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  trailing \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  in many crucial battleground states and facing close races in states that usually back Republicans, increasing the possibility that he could lose the \uc2 election\uc2  by a big margin in the Electoral College. Since contested \uc2 election\uc2  results must happen on a state-by-state basis, a stinging defeat could render Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's threats to dispute the results a moot point.\par \par \uc2 To emphasize that, the \uc2 Clinton\uc2  campaign initiated a new fund-raising pitch imploring supporters to help run up the score.\par \par \uc2 ''We can't just beat this guy,'' Christina Reynolds, a spokeswoman for Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , wrote to potential donors. ''We've got to beat him so definitively that Hillary's victory is undeniable.''\par \par \uc2 Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's running mate, Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia, said he hoped voters would give the Democratic ticket ''a mandate'' in the \uc2 election\uc2  so that Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  could not cast doubt on the outcome.\par \par \uc2 ''Donald is still going to whine if he loses, but if the mandate is clear, I don't think many people will follow him,'' he said on \uc2 CNN\uc2 , adding: ''We're confident in the American public.''\par \par \uc2 Democrats seized on Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's comments Thursday as evidence that he ws not fit to be president.\par \par \uc2 President Obama, speaking at a rally in Miami, skewered Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  for complaining of a rigged system and rejected the notion that an \uc2 election\uc2  in a country as large as the United States could be manipulated. He said that Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  was weakening the country by casting doubts about the validity of the \uc2 election\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 ''When you try to sow the seeds of doubt in people's minds about our elections, that undermines our democracy,'' Mr. Obama said. ''You're doing the work of our adversaries for them.''\par \par \uc2 Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  and Mr. Kaine both said Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's defiant comments were far beyond the political mainstream. Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , who called the remarks ''horrifying'' during Wednesday night's debate, repeated that criticism on board her campaign plane in Las Vegas, and said Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  was bucking centuries of American political decorum.\par \par \uc2 ''We are a country based on laws, and we've had hot, contested elections going back to the very beginning,'' Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  said. ''But one of our hallmarks has always been that we accept the outcomes of our \uc2 election\uc2 .''\par \par \uc2 Mr. Kaine went further in a series of television interviews Thursday, saying Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  was trying to take down a ''central pillar'' of the political system because he is on track for defeat.\par \par \uc2 The uproar over Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's potential unwillingness to abide by the results of the \uc2 election\uc2  threatens to further unravel a candidacy already in sharp decline. Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  has fallen well behind Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  in the polls after her three strong debate performances, and as Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  has faced escalating accusations that he sexually assaulted women.\par \par \uc2 A new accuser came forward on Thursday and described a 1998 encounter in which Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  grabbed her arm and touched her breast after making coarse remarks about her appearance to his male friends. The woman, Karena Virginia, was the 10th to accuse Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  of inappropriate sexual advances since the release of a tape on which he boasted of such behavior.\par \par \uc2 With many Republicans having abandoned his campaign, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  has spent most of the last week railing against what he has called a rigged \uc2 election\uc2 . He has said, without evidence, that there could be widespread fraud at the polls, including by undocumented immigrants, and claimed there is a conspiracy among Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , international corporations and the news media to block his candidacy.\par \par \uc2 After Wednesday night's debate, several Republican members of Congress stepped forward to chastise Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , including Senator \uc2 Lindsey Graham\uc2  of South Carolina, who said on social media that Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  was ''doing the party and country a great disservice'' by attacking the \uc2 election\uc2 's integrity.\par \par \uc2 Senators \uc2 John McCain\uc2 , Ben Sasse and Jeff Flake, all Republicans who have been critical of Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , chided him on Thursday for undermining America's system of self-government.\par \par \uc2 But Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  may be unlikely to bow to the backlash. He already effectively overruled his advisers by saying on the debate stage that he would leave the country in suspense as to how he would handle defeat.\par \par \uc2 Some supporters of Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , such as the conservative talk radio host Rush Limbaugh, sympathized with his cause, arguing that he would be conceding defeat and disappointing his supporters if he said that he was prepared to lose. However, even Mr. Limbaugh expressed dismay on Thursday at Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's uneven debate performance.\par \par \uc2 ''His political instincts just are not there,'' Mr. Limbaugh said. ''It's not that he blew it, it's that, man, it could have been so much better.''\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  did try out a new line of attack against Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  on Thursday, saying that she acted unethically by allowing Donna Brazile, the interim Democratic National Committee chairwoman, to tip her off to questions that she would face at a Democratic town hall event. The suggestion of such collusion was revealed in hacked emails released by \uc2 WikiLeaks\uc2 , and Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  called it ''cheating at the highest level.''\par \par \uc2 ''Why shouldn't \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  resign from the race?'' Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  wondered. ''She's a very dishonest person.''\par \par \uc2 Find out what you need to know about the 2016 presidential race today, and get politics news updates via \uc2 Facebook\uc2 , \uc2 Twitter\uc2  and the First Draft newsletter.\par \par \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2  before a rally Thursday in Delaware, Ohio.

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2 , in a rally in Ohio on Thursday, compared his reluctance to accept a possible loss in the presidential \uc2 election\uc2  to Democrat Al Gore's fight over the 2000 \uc2 election\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 The wrangling over the 2000 \uc2 election\uc2  results came after Mr. Gore appeared to have lost Florida by roughly 1,800 votes out of nearly six million ballots cast in the preliminary \uc2 election\uc2 -night results. The extremely narrow margin triggered an automatic recount under Florida law, and that meant no winner could be declared because neither candidate had reached the 270 Electoral College votes required to capture the White House.\par \par \uc2 "Al Gore conceded that time, un-conceded, and then re-conceded three weeks later," Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's ex-campaign manager \uc2 Corey Lewandowski\uc2  said on \uc2 CNN\uc2  Wednesday night.\par \par \uc2 Veterans of the 2000 presidential campaign of both parties say the biggest difference between now and then is that Mr. Gore didn't challenge the integrity of the voting system before \uc2 Election\uc2  Day.\par \par \uc2 In addition, once the process played out and all his avenues for legal challenges were closed, Mr. Gore conceded the \uc2 election\uc2  to George W. Bush in a speech that was widely praised as unifying.\par \par \uc2 "It's ridiculous," said Stuart Stevens, a Republican consultant who worked for Mr. Bush in 2000, of Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's comparison. "\uc2 Trump\uc2  is arguing before he's lost an \uc2 election\uc2  that an \uc2 election\uc2  is only valid if he wins," said Mr. Stevens, who has been publicly critical of Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Carter Eskew, who was one of Mr. Gore's top political advisers, said there was tremendous pressure on Mr. Gore from some of his supporters to continue his fight even after 35 days of legal fighting over the recount.\par \par \uc2 But Mr. Gore "accepted it in the most gracious, magisterial way," he said.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=wjco20161021000125"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document J000000020161021ecal00037\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw272\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4080\pichgoal600

\par\par \b \uc2 Trump\uc2  Stands by Remarks\b0\par\par\uc2 By Reid J. Epstein and Janet Hook   \par \uc2 929 \uc2 words\par \uc2 21 October 2016\par \uc2 The Wall Street Journal\par \uc2 J\par A1\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 DELAWARE, Ohio -- \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  on Thursday sought to explain his debate-stage suggestion the night before that he might not accept a loss in November's presidential vote as legitimate, saying at a rally here that he was simply affirming the ability of candidates to question an \uc2 election\uc2  outcome.\par \par \uc2 "I would also reserve my right to contest or file a legal challenge in the case of a questionable result," Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  said. "I will follow and abide by all the rules and traditions of all of the many candidates who came before me, always."\par \par \uc2 He also worked in a joke about the controversy he stirred. "I will totally accept the results of this great and historic presidential \uc2 election\uc2 ," Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  told the crowd, before adding: "If I win!"\par \par \uc2 The Republican nominee's remarks in Wednesday night's debate with Democrat \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , which appeared to break with generations of American political protocol that have ensured a peaceful transition of power, drew condemnation from even some of his staunchest allies.\par \par \uc2 It also raised fears among some fellow Republicans who will appear on the ballot with him, and infuriated state and local \uc2 election\uc2  officials -- many of whom are Republicans -- by questioning the integrity of their work.\par \par \uc2 Tennessee Sen. Bob Corker, whom Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  briefly considered to be his GOP running mate, said on \uc2 Twitter\uc2  that it "is imperative that \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  clearly state that he will accept the results of the \uc2 election\uc2  when complete."\par \par \uc2 Yet, at a rally here, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  continued his complaint about the names of dead people on voter rolls and repeated his unsubstantiated accusation that noncitizens are voting illegally.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's words at the debate and on Thursday echoed his longstanding assertion that the \uc2 election\uc2  is "rigged" against him. That is what he said in the Republican primaries when he lost a state and when he was outmaneuvered by rival Texas Sen. Ted Cruz in the arcane process of collecting delegates.\par \par \uc2 Only once during the primary season did Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  deliver a concession speech -- the night he placed second to Mr. Cruz in the Iowa caucuses, the very first state to hold a presidential contest.\par \par \uc2 When Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  lost Wisconsin's April 5 primary to Mr. Cruz, he didn't deliver a concession speech and didn't phone Mr. Cruz. Instead, a \uc2 Trump\uc2  campaign aide released a statement from an aide calling Mr. Cruz "worse than a puppet" and a "Trojan horse" for "party bosses attempting to steal the nomination from Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 ."\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's attacks on the integrity of the \uc2 election\uc2  system could foster divisions after \uc2 Election\uc2  Day and taint the outcome for some of his Senate Republican colleagues.\par \par \uc2 In Arizona, Pennsylvania, and New Hampshire, GOP senators are battling tough re-elections even as Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  is sliding behind Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  in public polling in their states. If Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  loses one of those states while the senator wins, allegations by the GOP nominee of voter fraud could taint the Senate outcome.\par \par \uc2 Arizona Sen. John McCain, who lost the 2008 \uc2 election\uc2  to President \uc2 Barack Obama\uc2 , said that whoever loses on Nov. 8 has "a duty" to concede to the winner. "I don't know who's going to win the presidential \uc2 election\uc2 . I do know that in every previous \uc2 election\uc2 , the loser congratulates the winner and calls them, 'my president,'" Mr. McCain said. "That's not just the Republican way or the Democratic way. It's the American way."\par \par \uc2 South Dakota Sen. John Thune, the third-ranking Senate Republican, said, "The American electoral process is the cornerstone of our democracy. Suggesting otherwise undermines an electoral system that is a model for nations around the world."\par \par \uc2 But at Thursday's rally, retiree Cindy Nicolosi said that Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  was within his rights to wait until after the votes are counted before saying whether he would accept the results. "I don't think he should do it until the very end," she said. "There's a lot of fraud out there."\par \par \uc2 Meanwhile, Republicans responsible for conducting elections defended their work and processes.\par \par \uc2 In Florida, Secretary of State \uc2 Ken Detzner\uc2  said, "Voters should feel confident that their votes will be counted." GOP secretaries of state in Ohio and Iowa this week stated that elections in their states will be fair.\par \par \uc2 Michael Ertel, the supervisor of elections in Seminole County, Fla., said he has been frustrated by Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's remarks, because he sought public office specifically to help restore voter confidence after Florida's 2000 presidential recount.\par \par \uc2 A Republican appointed by former GOP Gov. Jeb Bush, Mr. Ertel is using two \uc2 Twitter\uc2  accounts and a \uc2 Facebook\uc2  page for a public-relations campaign called "debunk the bunk." Monday's predebate tip: "We vote on paper. You can't hack paper."\par \par \uc2 The Obama administration, which has thrown its political weight behind Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , on Thursday offered a universal condemnation of Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Attorney General Loretta Lynch, speaking to reporters in Italy, said, "We don't see [ballot fraud] as an actual threat."\par \par \uc2 Mr. Obama, speaking at a \uc2 Clinton\uc2  rally in Miami, ridiculed Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  and then asked the crowd to stop laughing. "When you suggest rigging or fraud without a shred of evidence . . . that is not a joking matter. That is dangerous," he said. "When you try to sow the seeds of doubt in people's minds about the legitimacy of our elections, that undermines our democracy."\par \par \uc2 ---\par \par \uc2 Beth Reinhard in Washington and Giada Zampano in Rome contributed to this article.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=wjco20161021000110"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document J000000020161021ecal0002s\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw272\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4080\pichgoal600

\par\par \b \uc2 Election\uc2  2016: Emails Show Deliberations on TPP\b0\par\par\uc2 By Peter Nicholas   \par \uc2 394 \uc2 words\par \uc2 21 October 2016\par \uc2 The Wall Street Journal\par \uc2 J\par A6\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 Top advisers to \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  worried she would be accused of flip-flopping if she came out against a 12-nation Pacific trade deal she had once embraced, but also feared a political backlash if she stuck to her original position, hacked campaign emails show.\par \par \uc2 The back-and-forth offers a window into the \uc2 Clinton\uc2  campaign's thinking on the proposed Trans-Pacific Partnership trade pact, a delicate issue given opposition from parts of Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's coalition.\par \par \uc2 The emails were posted Thursday by the antisecrecy group \uc2 WikiLeaks\uc2 . U.S. officials believe that Russian intelligence agents hacked into \uc2 Clinton\uc2  campaign chairman \uc2 John Podesta\uc2 's account and stole the emails, giving them to \uc2 WikiLeaks\uc2  to disrupt the U.S. presidential race. The \uc2 Clinton\uc2  campaign has declined to confirm or deny the authenticity of specific emails.\par \par \uc2 As secretary of state, Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  described the Asian trade deal as the "gold standard" of free-trade pacts.\par \par \uc2 That was before she entered the presidential race. Organized labor and others want to scuttle TPP, so if Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  remained supportive she risked political reprisals.\par \par \uc2 On Oct. 3, 2015, three of her advisers traded notes that illustrated the political calculations in play.\par \par \uc2 In the email exchange, Ron Klain, who has helped Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  prepare for debates, wrote, "She has to be for TPP."\par \par \uc2 Mr. Klain added: "I think opposing that would be a huge flip-flop. She can say that as president she would work to change it. She can say that it can be better. But I think she should support it."\par \par \uc2 That produced a reply from senior adviser Jake Sullivan: "I agree with you on TPP but others (including on this email!) feel strongly to the contrary."\par \par \uc2 The exchange ends with campaign manager Robby Mook noting that organized labor wouldn't stand for her endorsing the trade deal. "TPP would be lethal with labor."\par \par \uc2 That calculation apparently carried the day.\par \par \uc2 Five days later, Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  announced she opposed the trade pact.\par \par \uc2 But her opposition to TPP has been questioned throughout the presidential race.\par \par \uc2 She addressed the matter Wednesday in her debate with Republican rival \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2 . "I'm against it now," she said. "I'll be against it after the \uc2 election\uc2 . I'll be against it when I'm president."\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=wjco20161021000109"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document J000000020161021ecal0002r\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw272\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4080\pichgoal600

\par\par \b \uc2 Election\uc2  2016: Democrats See Cash Influx As Senate Fight Intensifies\b0\par\par\uc2 By Michelle Hackman   \par \uc2 454 \uc2 words\par \uc2 21 October 2016\par \uc2 The Wall Street Journal\par \uc2 J\par A6\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 Senate Republicans fighting to keep control of the chamber in the face of \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2 's dip in the presidential polls are facing a new hurdle: an influx of last-minute cash for their Democratic opponents.\par \par \uc2 In the two weeks leading up to \uc2 Election\uc2  Day, Democratic outside groups are set to spend substantially more money on TV advertising than their GOP counterparts in eight of 10 Senate races, sending Republicans scrambling to narrow the gap.\par \par \uc2 The GOP holds a spending advantage only in Ohio and Florida, two states where Democrats have all but conceded losses to Republican incumbent Sens. Rob Portman and \uc2 Marco Rubio\uc2 . Yet those two prospective setbacks have cleared the way for pro-Democratic outside groups to shift their cash to other competitive races.\par \par \uc2 In Indiana, Missouri, Nevada, New Hampshire, North Carolina and Pennsylvania, ad reservations show Democrats have committed at least $1 million more than Republicans.\par \par \uc2 In Pennsylvania, Democrats are set to spend $15 million from Oct. 17 through \uc2 Election\uc2  Day, compared with Republicans' $9 million, according to a media tracker. In New Hampshire, Democrats are investing $17 million, compared with Republicans' $11 million.\par \par \uc2 "There absolutely is a push to get some more money in, and I personally have made a bunch of calls in the last few days to try and make that happen," said Mel Immergut, a venture capitalist and a major GOP donor focused on several Senate races.\par \par \uc2 The Democratic advantage is particularly notable in a year when Republican fundraisers, who typically focus their resources on presidential contests, have shied from Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 . GOP strategists thought the money sidelined in the White House race would trickle down to congressional contests.\par \par \uc2 Yet, beyond a few large checks cut by donors such as casino billionaire \uc2 Sheldon Adelson\uc2 , that enthusiasm hasn't materialized. Steven Law, the head of the Senate Leadership Fund, the primary GOP super PAC defending Senate Republicans, said he believes the opposite has occurred.\par \par \uc2 "Democratic donors have come to the conclusion that they can turn their attention from the top of the ticket to down-ticket races," he said.\par \par \uc2 While the Senate Democratic campaign arm and an affiliated super PAC, Senate Majority PAC, have led the charge, labor, environmental and women's groups have also been working to help blanket airwaves.\par \par \uc2 Priorities USA, the main outside group backing Democrat \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's presidential bid, this week said it would shift some resources in New Hampshire and Pennsylvania to help challengers Maggie Hassan and Katie McGinty.\par \par \uc2 GOP Senate candidates are mainly relying on help from the \uc2 National Republican Senatorial Committee\uc2  and a super PAC, the Senate Leadership Fund.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=wjco20161021000108"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document J000000020161021ecal0002q\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw272\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4080\pichgoal600

And the court didn't accept that reasonable regulation," she said at the debate with her Republican rival, \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Her answer glossed over the thrust of the city's gun law, which effectively barred private ownership of handguns. The City Council established one of the strictest handgun laws in the country, forbidding residents from registering guns and making it illegal to possess an unregistered firearm.\par \par \uc2 The Supreme Court's majority did consider a secondary question about the storage of firearms, but that was only in the context of the right of a citizen to use a handgun for self-defense.\par \par \uc2 A spokesman for Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  noted that attorneys for the District of Columbia did argue in the case that the city's weapons regulations were meant to protect children. The \uc2 Clinton\uc2  campaign also pointed to research showing that gun locks can help prevent accidental shootings by children.\par \par \uc2 But the court's finding revolved around a constitutional question: Was there an individual right to bear arms under the Constitution and did the Washington, D.C., handgun ban violate that right?\par \par \uc2 In a 5-4 decision, the Supreme Court for the first time said there is an individual right to bear arms for self-defense, including handguns.\par \par \uc2 "Handguns are the most popular weapon chosen by Americans for self-defense in the home, and a complete prohibition of their use is invalid," the late Justice Antonin Scalia wrote for the court's majority.\par \par \uc2 The court would then go on to strike down the city's requirement that lawfully registered firearms be rendered inoperable any time they were in the home.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=wjco20161021000107"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document J000000020161021ecal0002p\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw272\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4080\pichgoal600

\par\par \b \uc2 Election\uc2  2016: Cuban-Americans Pose Test for \uc2 Trump\uc2  --- Group's traditional loyalty to Republican Party has weakened in recent years\b0\par\par\uc2 By Beth Reinhard   \par \uc2 727 \uc2 words\par \uc2 21 October 2016\par \uc2 The Wall Street Journal\par \uc2 J\par A4\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 MIAMI -- \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2 's strained relationship with the Cuban-American community is a challenge for his presidential bid in must-win Florida and is forcing Republicans to consider how the nation's most populous purple state is taking on a bluer hue.\par \par \uc2 Most Cuban-Americans have voted in lockstep with the GOP for decades, but that bond loosened in recent years as younger generations showed less interest in the GOP's fealty to the Cold War-era embargo against Cuba. That means \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  could become the first Democratic presidential nominee to win a majority of Cuban-Americans, potentially shifting the balance of power statewide.\par \par \uc2 "It's plausible she gets to 50%, and in a close \uc2 election\uc2 , that could tilt the balance," said Al Cardenas, former Cuban-American chairman of the Florida Republican Party."The question is whether \uc2 Trump\uc2  is an outlier or if there is permanent damage to the Republican Party in Florida."\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's allies say they remain confident he will win this bloc and the state, but they acknowledge challenges. Of 2.6 million eligible Hispanic voters in Florida, about 31% are Cuban-American, most of whom live in Miami-Dade County. "It's brutal being the only one on the circuit," said Rep. Carlos Trujillo of Miami, the only Cuban-American state lawmaker campaigning for Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Cuban-Americans have tilted Republican since the 1980s, when President Ronald Reagan's fierce anti-Communist stance emboldened an exile community that had fled Fidel Castro. Signs of realignment emerged in 2012, when Cuban-Americans in Florida split nearly evenly between President \uc2 Barack Obama\uc2  and GOP candidate \uc2 Mitt Romney\uc2 , according to exit polls.\par \par \uc2 Some of the Cuban-American Republicans who have sworn off Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  or pledged to vote for Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  include two of the three members of Congress representing Miami-Dade County, the mayor of Miami-Dade and the mayor of Miami.\par \par \uc2 Much of Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's support among Cuban-Americans seems to be less enthusiasm for the Democratic ticket than a backlash against what they see as Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's divisive rhetoric, lack of policy knowledge and anti-immigrant posture. "This will be the first time in my life that I don't cast a ballot for the Republican presidential nominee," said \uc2 Rudy Fernandez\uc2 , a veteran of the \uc2 Republican National Committee\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Miami-Dade, where nearly three of four Republicans are Cuban-American, was the only county Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  lost to Florida Sen. Marco Rubio in the March primary. Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  is leading Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  by 7 percentage points among Cuban-Americans there, according to a new poll by WLRN-Univision 23, a local radio and television affiliate.\par \par \uc2 A \uc2 Univision\uc2  News poll in September found Cuban-Americans evenly divided on the nominees, with 41% for each. Those figures signal a sharp drop in GOP support from 2004, when Mr. Bush won 78% of the Cuban vote in Florida.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  is trying to shore up the Cuban-American vote in Florida. "The people of Cuba have struggled too long," he posted on \uc2 Twitter\uc2  last week. "Will reverse Obama's Executive Orders and concessions towards Cuba until freedoms are restored."\par \par \uc2 Last week, the \uc2 Trump\uc2  campaign dispatched vice-presidential nominee \uc2 Mike Pence\uc2  to a Miami-Dade GOP dinner where the Indiana governor earned a standing ovation for pledging to reverse the Obama administration's diplomacy toward Cuba.\par \par \uc2 But that issue doesn't carry the weight it once did. A recent \uc2 Florida International University\uc2  poll showed 63% of Cuban-American residents of Miami-Dade oppose the continuation of the embargo, a big change from 20 years ago, when 78% backed the embargo.\par \par \uc2 Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  favors lifting the embargo, a reversal from her 2008 campaign, when she said Cuba first had to move toward democratic reforms.\par \par \uc2 Many older Cuban-Americans in the state view the administration's new relations with Cuba as a betrayal that rewards a repressive regime.\par \par \uc2 Remedios Diaz, a Miami business leader and a loyal Republican, left Cuba in 1961, while two of her schoolmates were shot by firing squad. She's "not in love" with Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  but can't vote for a Democrat. "I cannot forget," she said. "I cannot forgive."\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=wjco20161021000106"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document J000000020161021ecal0002o\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw272\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4080\pichgoal600

\par\par \b \uc2 World News -- Middle East Crossroads: \uc2 Trump\uc2  Garners Unlikely Muslim Cheerleaders in Mideast\b0\par\par\uc2 By Yaroslav Trofimov   \par \uc2 702 \uc2 words\par \uc2 21 October 2016\par \uc2 The Wall Street Journal\par \uc2 J\par A8\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 DUBAI -- With his statements targeting Muslims, it might seem that \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  would have few cheerleaders in the Middle East. And yet, as the U.S. presidential \uc2 election\uc2  approaches, an unusual collection of America's Muslim friends and foes is rooting for the Republican candidate.\par \par \uc2 Broadly, they can be grouped in two camps. The first are those long opposed to America's presence in the region and encouraged by Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's isolationist thinking. They figure discrimination against Muslims in America is an acceptable price for ending America's decadeslong involvement in the Middle East. A \uc2 Trump\uc2  victory, they hope, would greatly diminish America's global standing.\par \par \uc2 Then there are some traditional U.S. allies in the region who have grown alienated under President \uc2 Barack Obama\uc2  and who fear \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  would renew U.S. efforts to promote democracy in the region. In particular, these politicians in countries such as Egypt and Turkey find solace in Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's reluctance to criticize human-rights violations abroad.\par \par \uc2 "Those regimes have a lot of concerns about a relaunch of the democratic project. For them, supporting \uc2 Trump\uc2  is a pragmatic choice," said Jordanian commentator Amer al-Sabaileh, head of the independent Mempsi think tank in Amman. "Their major priority is not to lose power, and they don't care about how he views Muslims."\par \par \uc2 Iran's stance in the U.S. presidential race is particularly interesting. On the surface, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  appears a hawk on Iran. He has criticized the nuclear deal struck by Mr. Obama. Yet, unlike Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , he also appeared to embrace the core Iranian narrative of the current turmoil in the Middle East. He portrayed Tehran, the Syrian regime of President Bashar al-Assad and Russia as forces combating terrorism.\par \par \uc2 While the Obama administration points out that Iran, Russia and the Syrian regime focus their firepower on moderate rebels who oppose Islamic State, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , at the third debate on Wednesday, asserted that these rebels may be worse than Mr. Assad.\par \par \uc2 "There are noises of joy in Iran when \uc2 Trump\uc2  turns around and says that Iran is on the right side in Syria," said Alex Vatanka, Iran expert at the \uc2 Middle East Institute\uc2  in Washington. Yet, he added, the real reason Iranian leaders are rooting for him goes deeper.\par \par \uc2 "The hard-liners in Tehran view the \uc2 Trump\uc2  presidency as one where any kind of coalition against Iran in the way Iranians experienced it in the past 10 years would be so much harder for Washington to achieve," Mr. Vatanka said. "That becomes, in itself, an opportunity for Iran on the international stage."\par \par \uc2 Even Hassan Nasrallah, the leader of Lebanon's Iran-backed Shiite Hezbollah militia, approvingly quoted Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  in a recent speech, citing the Republican candidate to support his longtime allegation that the Obama administration and Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  had created the Sunni extremist Islamic State.\par \par \uc2 In Turkey, President \uc2 Recep Tayyip Erdogan\uc2  initially reacted with anger when Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  proposed to bar Muslims from entering the U.S. -- a stance since modified as "extreme vetting."\par \par \uc2 Mr. Erdogan's tone changed dramatically after the failed July coup against him. Unlike the Obama administration, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  refused to criticize the wave of detentions and dismissals that followed the failed coup and expressed his admiration for the Turkish leader.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Erdogan reciprocated and, in a September TV interview, played down Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's remarks on Muslims as mere campaign talk.\par \par \uc2 A similar dynamic developed with another authoritarian leader in the Middle East, Egyptian President Abdel Fattah Al Sisi, who ousted the democratically elected Islamist President Mohammed Morsi in 2013 and then imprisoned tens of thousands of opponents.\par \par \uc2 "There are things about his approach to the region that Sisi and some other authoritarians do like. It's a policy approach that cares not one whit about things like human rights and democracy," explained Michael Wahid Hanna, a senior fellow at the \uc2 Century Foundation\uc2  in New York.\par \par \uc2 Those sympathies for Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  are tempered by the reality of the opinion polls, Mr. Hanna added. "They don't believe he is going to win."\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=wjco20161021000065"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document J000000020161021ecal0001q\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw272\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4080\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 Quick, someone get the smelling salts for the media. Ever since that dastardly \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  told Chris Wallace, "I'll keep you in suspense" about recognizing the \uc2 election\uc2  result, we haven't seen so much swooning and fainting since Scarlett O'Hara in "Gone With the Wind."\par \par \uc2 Starting with the 2000 \uc2 election\uc2 , it became Democratic writ that \uc2 election\uc2  outcomes could be questioned and contested. To this day many Democrats have convinced themselves, via repetition, that George W. Bush stole the 2000 \uc2 election\uc2  in Florida.\par \par \uc2 In fact, Mr. Bush won the original count and the mandatory mini-recount. Virtually all serious attempts to finalize the Florida vote came to the same conclusion. Mr. Bush won. It was Al Gore who pushed the result into the courts of Florida in an effort to have the initial result overturned. Finally, the \uc2 U.S. Supreme Court\uc2  ruled that enough was enough.\par \par \uc2 The Florida recount fight made for great melodrama, but it was a media circus, and a destructive one. The partisan divide created by that sensational event is responsible in part for the divisions that endure to this day.\par \par \uc2 Four years later, Democrats again argued extensively that George Bush stole the \uc2 election\uc2  from \uc2 John Kerry\uc2  because the President's campaign surrogates engineered the vote in Ohio against \uc2 John Kerry\uc2 . Mr. Kerry conceded the \uc2 election\uc2 , and it must be noted that he kept his own qualms private for many years.\par \par \uc2 Both parties have since created a cottage industry dedicated to bird-dogging future \uc2 election\uc2  results in precincts around the country. And that's fine. Keep the politicians honest.\par \par \uc2 Now comes \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2 , with his usual rank amateur flair, suggesting that if he loses it will be because the entire U.S. electoral system -- presumably encompassing all 50 states -- was fixed against him. As always, it fell to post-debate surrogates to make the distinctions he himself is incapable of making between discrete events -- Illinois in 1960, Florida in 2000 -- and the legitimacy of the entire system.\par \par \uc2 For failing to make any such distinction, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  once again reaps a media whirlwind that blows his candidacy off \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's manifest vulnerabilities.\par \par \uc2 None of that excuses the American media's faux fainting spell over this episode. We know that the normal cynicism of the media class hasn't been displaced by an endemic naivete about politics. The extraordinary overweighting of Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's ham-handed and self-defeating remark will only feed the widespread public impression that the media are trying to preordain the \uc2 election\uc2 's outcome.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=wjco20161021000062"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document J000000020161021ecal0001n\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw272\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4080\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 A few weeks before one of the most consequential presidential elections in history, the Republican candidate struggled with the possibility that he would likely lose. He had no choice but to face the ultimate decision: whether or not to accept the verdict, whatever it might be.\par \par \uc2 The answer was quite different in 1864 than in 2016, because the presidential nominee then wasn't \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2 , but Abraham Lincoln, whom Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  professes to admire.\par \par \uc2 If anyone ever had a reason to reject the will of the voters, it was Lincoln in 1864, running for re-\uc2 election\uc2  against George B. McClellan. The presidential campaign was taking place in the midst of a civil war, with freedom of the press and speech under suspension by the president himself, using what he called his "war powers" to limit dissent that might discourage military enlistment. Half the country was in armed conflict with the other, and the casualties were already half a million souls. A state of emergency prevailed. Military tribunals had sprung up in border states to supplant the civil judicial system.\par \par \uc2 Trying valiantly to quash rebellion, Lincoln might have agreed to cancel or postpone the \uc2 election\uc2 . Instead, he insisted that "we cannot have free government without elections; and if the rebellion could force us to forego, or postpone, a national \uc2 election\uc2 , it, might fairly claim to have already conquered and ruined us." The U.S. became the first nation to hold a popular \uc2 election\uc2  during civil war.\par \par \uc2 That didn't stop the bleeding -- either on the battlefield or in public opinion. Late in August, Lincoln concluded that it was "exceedingly probable" that he would lose. Knowing that a Democratic successor might let the South leave the Union and would almost certainly cancel the Emancipation Proclamation upon taking office, Lincoln did two extraordinary things.\par \par \uc2 First, he invited the African-American abolitionist Frederick Douglass to the White House. There, Lincoln assigned him to craft a plan to use the time between \uc2 Election\uc2  Day and Inauguration Day (then March 4) to send official liberators into the Deep South. There, they were to spread the word of emancipation to as many enslaved people as possible, guaranteeing their freedom "then, thenceforward, and forever" -- and before the opposition took the White House and stopped the process. Douglass drafted a blueprint for action, although the administration never had to deploy it.\par \par \uc2 Then Lincoln prepared a concessionary memorandum of his own, signed sight-unseen by his cabinet, pledging not only "to cooperate with the President elect," but "to save the Union between the \uc2 election\uc2  and the inauguration; as he will have secured his \uc2 election\uc2  on such ground that he cannot possibly save it afterwards."\par \par \uc2 Whether the memo was legally binding, no one can be sure. But that it demonstrated that an all-powerful chief executive was willing to step down, cooperate and accept the will of the voters is indisputable. He wasn't too big to fall. \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  has a great deal to learn from the man he called, in the second debate, "the late, great Abraham Lincoln."\par \par \uc2 ---\par \par \uc2 Mr. Holzer, who won the 2015 Lincoln Prize, is director of the Roosevelt House Public Policy Institute at Hunter College.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=wjco20161021000043"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document J000000020161021ecal00014\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw272\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4080\pichgoal600

Strassel   \par \uc2 878 \uc2 words\par \uc2 21 October 2016\par \uc2 The Wall Street Journal\par \uc2 J\par A11\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  had two jobs at Wednesday night's debate. Voters can thank him for getting at least one of them done.\par \par \uc2 Among the biggest tasks for any presidential candidate is painting a picture of what life will be like under his opponent. But Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  has been so overwhelmingly the focus of this race (what will he do next?) that \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's policies seem at most a media afterthought. On Wednesday he finally changed that dynamic, with the help of Fox News moderator Chris Wallace, the only debate host to keep the focus on the issues and to pose challenging questions to both sides. On substance, Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  was exposed for what she is: a liberal in an ethical minefield.\par \par \uc2 From the debate's first question -- about the Supreme Court -- Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  highlighted that Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  is far to the left of the average voter. She feigned support for the Second Amendment, even while making clear that her Supreme Court nominees would abolish the individual right to bear arms. In her rush to play the woman card, she ended up defending even late-term abortions, which are opposed by a strong majority of Americans. She pledged that her Supreme Court would ditch equality under the law, and instead operate as a weapon for social justice.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  presented a country that would ride economic growth to a better future. Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  presented a country that would continue the angry work of redistributing a shrinking pie. She showed that she would double down on the worst of President Obama's economic policies and regulations. Hate your ObamaCare? You'll have to keep it, and pay more. Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  acknowledged that Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  would cut taxes, and that she would raise them. She said that her administration could institute all her sweeping new government programs without adding "a penny" of debt -- a ludicrous claim.\par \par \uc2 The GOP nominee also drew out \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  the political hack, who caters her poll-driven policies to whatever audience she's standing in front of at the moment. He reminded voters of her secret speeches to bankers, in which she expressed the polar opposite of what she's saying today on the campaign trail. Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's criticism of her flip-flop on the Pacific trade deal elicited one of her biggest whoppers of the night. Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  again claimed that she changed her mind on the agreement after reading it. But emails dumped by \uc2 WikiLeaks\uc2  prove that she had decided against the deal before the text was released, purely to curry union support.\par \par \uc2 Then Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  did his most effective job yet of underlining the risks of electing another ethically and morally damaged \uc2 Clinton\uc2 . He painted her as a woman who recklessly disregarded national security with her secret server, and who then was let off the hook by friendly investigators. Particularly compelling was the comparison Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  made to retired Marine Gen. James Cartwright, who faces jail in an investigation of leaked classified information -- and who received none of the allowances from the Justice Department that Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  did. The Democratic nominee also had to outright (and noticeably) duck a question about the \uc2 Clinton\uc2  Foundation\uc2 , because she has no way of refuting the evidence that she and her State Department staff did favors for donors and buddies.\par \par \uc2 If Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  nonetheless loses this \uc2 election\uc2 , it's because he has failed to do the harder job: He hasn't given millions of voters the comfort -- or reason -- that they need to vote for him.\par \par \uc2 Despite some high-profile Never Trumpers, the GOP is remarkably consolidated around its nominee. This isn't so much Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's doing as it is the hard work of conservative leaders, who have convinced many Republicans that it is their duty to stop Hillary. The radio host \uc2 Mark Levin\uc2  on Monday summed up this argument on his show: "It's not even about supporting \uc2 Trump\uc2 . It's about taking the most principled moral position you can for your family and your country, under very difficult circumstances. And that's what you do in life most of the time."\par \par \uc2 Wednesday's debate probably helped Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  with that constituency only. It's everyone else that is his problem. To win, he needs more than conservatives -- that's simply the math. Yet during the debate he continued to offend the very constituencies he needs. You don't win over women by bragging that you didn't even apologize to your wife after being caught, on tape, ogling other ladies and boasting about sexual exploits. You don't win Hispanics by needlessly deploying the word "hombre" in a discussion about crime. You don't win independents by suggesting that you might refuse to accept the results of the \uc2 election\uc2  if you lose.\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 Trump\uc2  campaign's entire bet seems to be that it can turn out unprecedented numbers of white voters, overlooked masses who are new to politics and drawn by Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's brash talk to finally take part. He had better hope so. Because he's running out of time to make the bigger sale.\par \par \uc2 ---\par \par \uc2 Write to kim@wsj.com\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=wjco20161021000041"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document J000000020161021ecal00012\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw272\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4080\pichgoal600

\par\par \b \uc2 ARENA --- Arts & Entertainment: The Campaign To Get Noticed --- With viewers glued to the presidential \uc2 election\uc2 , it's hard for new books, TV shows and movies to break through\b0\par\par\uc2 By John Jurgensen and Ellen Gamerman   \par \uc2 2,012 \uc2 words\par \uc2 21 October 2016\par \uc2 The Wall Street Journal\par \uc2 J\par D1\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 Americans are binge-watching the U.S. presidential race as a political season packed with cliffhangers heads into its finale. To avoid getting lost amid the Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 -Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  drama, marketers launching new TV shows, books and movies are being forced to take evasive action.\par \par \uc2 Election\uc2  obsession is siphoning away already-elusive audiences. In the fall TV season, prime-time viewers for the top four broadcasters dropped 9.2% from last year among adults under age 50, according to Nielsen. The once-invulnerable giant of live sports, the \uc2 National Football League\uc2 , is limping with its lowest prime-time game ratings in years. At the movies, ticket sales since Labor Day are down by 16% compared with the same period last year, according to ComScore. And book sellers worry that while some cookbooks and escapist fiction are holding up, titles largely dependent on media coverage risk being overlooked.\par \par \uc2 At BookPeople in Austin, Texas, summertime sales of general fiction titles fell 12% from last year, while science fiction took a 26% hit. "I guess they don't need science fiction because they're getting so much in politics," says Steve Bercu, who is co-owner of the 46-year-old store. Sales of books about politics and current events, he said, surged 45% during the same period.\par \par \uc2 The high-stakes political jousting has inspired some defensive strategies. With the first presidential debate looming Sept. 26, ABC, \uc2 CBS\uc2  and \uc2 NBC\uc2  delayed the new season premieres of Monday-night dramas, such as "Timeless" and "Conviction," until October so they wouldn't be pre-empted by the candidates' evening match-up. The candidates met again in Las Vegas on Wednesday night for their final debate, bumping shows like "Modern Family" and "Law & Order: Special Victims Unit."\par \par \uc2 Drawing 84 million viewers across 13 TV networks (and more viewers online), the Sept. 26 \uc2 Clinton\uc2 -\uc2 Trump\uc2  showdown was the most-watched debate in American history. To avoid being eclipsed by the second debate on Sunday, Oct. 9, \uc2 HBO\uc2  released that night's episodes of three new series ("Divorce," "Insecure" and "Westworld") on its digital platforms two days early. "There was an unpredictability that took it out of the usual realm of dry presidential debates and put it into TV event status," says HBO president of programming Casey Bloys.\par \par \uc2 "Nothing is selling," Paul Bogaards, head of public relations at New York publisher Alfred A. Knopf, lamented, not altogether tongue-in-cheek, on \uc2 Twitter\uc2  this week. In an email, he added: "There's not a lot of bandwidth for books and authors during the heat of a Presidential \uc2 election\uc2 , this year especially so."\par \par \uc2 Literary agent James Levine says two nonfiction books he is handling that initially had planned fall debuts were held back -- both written by best-selling authors promoting bipartisanship. "The Great Equalizer," a roadmap for economic growth by David Smick, and "The New Urban Crisis," a study of challenges facing the nation's cities by Richard Florida, will come out in 2017. "In both cases, publisher, author and agent didn't want them to get caught up in the scrum of the \uc2 election\uc2  and wanted time to set them up properly," Mr. Levine says.\par \par \uc2 Books must be shipped by late October to make many bookstore holiday gift tables by early November. For that reason, National Geographic stuck to the Oct. 25 release date for "@NatGeo," a volume of photographs from its \uc2 Instagram\uc2  feed. However, the company is postponing marketing until two days after \uc2 Election\uc2  Day, which falls on Nov. 8. National Geographic sales teams now are updating booksellers about the delayed promotion, hoping stores will hold onto "@NatGeo" longer than usual before sending back unpurchased copies.\par \par \uc2 "You want people buying before Thanksgiving if possible, but when are people really going to start paying attention?" asks Heidi Vincent, National Geographic's vice president of marketing for books and maps. "We're taking a guess, 'OK, the \uc2 election\uc2 's done for a couple of days, this is a good kickoff time.'"\par \par \uc2 American publishers often release books on Tuesdays, one of which will soon put a new president in the White House. To take advantage of activity at the polls, \uc2 Random House\uc2  moved up the release of Lee Child's new Jack Reacher novel "Night School" by 24 hours, from \uc2 Election\uc2  Day to Monday, Nov. 7. The publisher plans to offer "Jack Reacher" free coffee at several New York City polling places.\par \par \uc2 "Stranger than fiction" is a phrase that comes up often among obsessed \uc2 election\uc2 -watchers, and for many the \uc2 Clinton\uc2 -\uc2 Trump\uc2  grudge match has replaced other forms of entertainment. "I guess you could say it's like watching a real-life 'Game of Thrones' -- you just can't get enough," says Beth Ann Sadowski, a 34-year-old freelance photographer in Washington. She spends at least five hours a day scouring \uc2 election\uc2  news on social media, leaving little time for many other pursuits.\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 election\uc2  binge means Ms. Sadowski's reading has stalled, leaving her stuck for months on page 629 of Doris Kearns Goodwin's "Team of Rivals." Enmeshed in political discussions on \uc2 Twitter\uc2  in the evenings, she has missed football and baseball games on TV as well as favorite shows like "Scream Queens." Ms. Sadowski, a \uc2 Clinton\uc2  supporter and campaign volunteer, says she has always been politically active but never to such distraction: "Every time you turn on the television it's the new episode of 'What Can Go Wrong in American Politics.'"\par \par \uc2 Dan Perkins, the editorial cartoonist known as Tom Tomorrow, said he was signing autographs at New York Comic Con when news broke of the videotape featuring Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's lewd comments about women. Mr. Perkins left as soon as possible and raced to his home near New Haven, Conn., to update his weekly cartoon. The \uc2 Clinton\uc2  supporter's \uc2 election\uc2  obsession has left several pop-culture casualties. "I'm reading less, I'm going to fewer movies, I'm watching less TV," he says. "I'm interested in 'Westworld' -- I haven't seen it. I normally would have burned through the entire season of 'Luke Cage' and I've only seen one episode."\par \par \uc2 To be sure, the \uc2 election\uc2  is just one distraction besetting the entertainment industry. Traditional TV audiences have been declining for years, eroded by streaming content and other forms of media fragmentation. And a lack of Hollywood hits this season, such as last fall's "The Martian," is more to blame for disappointing ticket sales than the White House race.\par \par \uc2 A dearth of box-office competition may benefit studios releasing escapist movies less than a week before \uc2 Election\uc2  Day, such as "Doctor Strange," a bid to launch a new superhero franchise featuring Benedict Cumberbatch.\par \par \uc2 "Marvel isn't afraid of a little thing called the \uc2 election\uc2 ," says \uc2 Paul Dergarabedian\uc2 , a box-office analyst with ComScore. Still, he speculates that political noise is smothering some buzz about new releases. "That adds a layer of competition . . . Where you might have bounced from \uc2 Netflix\uc2  out of the house to the movies, maybe now you're bouncing from \uc2 Netflix\uc2  to cable news."\par \par \uc2 Indeed, news outlets have feasted on the \uc2 election\uc2  obsession. Between Sept. 19 and Oct. 9, viewership for the cable news networks was up 39% compared to the same period during the last presidential \uc2 election\uc2 . And the average amount of time each viewer spent watching these channels during that three-week period jumped by about 3 hours -- from 13.5 hours in 2012 to 16.5 hours this year.\par \par \uc2 The drumbeat of political news may have driven some TV viewers to snub their usual fare. The audience for prime-time sitcoms dropped 14% from last year among heavy viewers of Fox News, and fell 10% for heavy MSNBC and \uc2 CNN\uc2  viewers, according to \uc2 TiVo\uc2 . The DVR maker looked for \uc2 election\uc2 -related viewing patterns in 2.3 million households using \uc2 TiVo\uc2  and six other TV providers. In the second quarter (the most recent period for which complete data is available) other scripted genres saw similar drops among news junkies. While the general audience for police and fire dramas declined by 6% from last year, the drop was steeper for heavy consumers of \uc2 CNN\uc2  (11%), MSNBC (12%) and Fox News (17%).\par \par \uc2 No wonder some entertainment titans are looking for a scapegoat. In a recent memo to \uc2 NFL\uc2  teams, the league's broadcasting heads said, "There is no question that unprecedented interest in the Presidential \uc2 election\uc2  is impacting primetime ratings," and added, "The effect of the Presidential \uc2 election\uc2  on \uc2 NFL\uc2  ratings has been seen before."\par \par \uc2 Late-night TV is milking the political hijinks for all they're worth. "Saturday Night Live," which added \uc2 Alec Baldwin\uc2 's impression of \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  this season, hasn't scored audiences this big since \uc2 Barack Obama\uc2  was seeking the White House in 2008. Seth Meyers recently took his "Late Night" to Washington for a week and generated some of the \uc2 NBC\uc2  program's most-watched shows in months. On \uc2 HBO\uc2 , John Oliver's "Last Week Tonight" has hit a series high of 5.6 million average viewers, up from 4.7 million last season, and "Real Time with Bill Maher" ticked up to 4.4 million from 4 million last year.\par \par \uc2 After the \uc2 Trump\uc2  video came out, Showtime Networks CEO David Nevins sent a 2 a.m. email deploying producers of "The Circus," the network's real-time documentary series about the presidential race, back into the field a week earlier than they had planned. Featuring journalists Mark Halperin and John Heilemann and campaign strategist Mark McKinnon, the show is Showtime's highest-rated unscripted series in six years and thrust the network into \uc2 election\uc2  coverage for the first time.\par \par \uc2 Nimbleness is required. After Mr. Nevins asked CBS chairman \uc2 Leslie Moonves\uc2  if Showtime could borrow "Late Show" host \uc2 Stephen Colbert\uc2  for a political special, Mr. Colbert volunteered to do a live show on \uc2 Election\uc2  Night. Since his usual \uc2 CBS\uc2  slot will be taken over by political coverage that night, Mr. Colbert will go live on Showtime from his "Late Show" set slightly modified for the occasion. Because it is pay cable, he will be uncensored but also plans to stay on top of the news. "Colbert said, 'If they declare Pennsylvania or Nevada in the 11 o'clock hour, no problem, we'll deliver the results,'" Mr. Nevins says.\par \par \uc2 Another beneficiary of the \uc2 election\uc2  binge is social media, where everyone's a pundit and the flow of news and opinions never ceases. From January to the start of October, more than half of all \uc2 Facebook\uc2  users in the U.S. joined discussions about the \uc2 election\uc2  -- roughly 109 million of a total 205 million, according to the company. On average, those users liked, posted, commented or shared something about the \uc2 election\uc2  more than 48 times each. On \uc2 YouTube\uc2 , views of debate-related videos exceeded 88 million for the first debate and rose by nearly 41 percent to 124 million for the second debate earlier this month. The second debate ignited 17 million related tweets, amid an \uc2 election\uc2  discussion that has been surging on \uc2 Twitter\uc2  since January.\par \par \uc2 Not everyone is riveted by the campaign. This week, a Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll found signs that two key Democratic constituencies -- African Americans and younger voters -- were beginning to lose interest in the \uc2 election\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Some sufferers of political overload are returning to their old entertainment habits. Raman Pfaff, a 52-year-old educational-software programmer from Charlottesville, Va., had been frustrated by the headlines and was losing sleep after watching cable news. In recent days he has embarked on an \uc2 election\uc2  diet, quitting news sites and limiting his discussions on social media. Mr. Pfaff says he is back into "The Game is Life" science-fiction series by Terry Schott and has more time to watch football. "Hopefully," he says, "I'll get all mellow."\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=wjco20161021000020"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document J000000020161021ecal0000i\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved.  \par \par \uc2 Following is a transcript of the third presidential debate, on Wednesday, as transcribed by CQ Transcriptswire.\par \par \uc2 WALLACE: Good evening from the Thomas and Mack Center at the \uc2 University of Nevada, Las Vegas\uc2 . I'm Chris Wallace of Fox News, and I welcome you to the third and final of the 2016 presidential debates between Secretary of State \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  and \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 WALLACE: This debate is sponsored by the \uc2 Commission on Presidential Debates\uc2 . The commission has designed the format: Six roughly 15-minute segments with two-minute answers to the first question, then open discussion for the rest of each segment. Both campaigns have agreed to those rules.\par \par \uc2 For the record, I decided the topics and the questions in each topic. None of those questions has been shared with the commission or the two candidates. The audience here in the hall has promised to remain silent. No cheers, boos, or other interruptions so we and you can focus on what the candidates have to say.\par \par \uc2 WALLACE: No noise, except right now, as we welcome the Democratic nominee for president, Secretary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , and the Republican nominee for president, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 Secretary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , welcome. Let's get right to it. The first topic is the Supreme Court.\par \par \uc2 You both talked briefly about the court in the last debate, but I want to drill down on this, because the next president will almost certainly have at least one appointment and likely or possibly two or three appointments.\par \par \uc2 WALLACE: Which means that you will, in effect, determine the balance of the court for what could be the next quarter century.\par \par \uc2 First of all, where do you want to see the court take the country? And secondly, what's your view on how the Constitution should be interpreted? Do the founders' words mean what they say or is it a living document to be applied flexibly according to changing circumstances? In this segment, Secretary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , you go first. You have two minutes.\par \par \uc2 CLINTON\uc2 : Thank you very much, Chris. And thanks to UNLV for hosting us.\par \par \uc2 You know, I think when we talk about the Supreme Court, it really raises the central issue in this \uc2 election\uc2 , namely, what kind of country are we going to be? What kind of opportunities will we provide for our citizens? What kind of rights will Americans have?\par \par \uc2 And I feel strongly that the Supreme Court needs to stand on the side of the American people, not on the side of the powerful corporations and the wealthy. For me, that means that we need a Supreme Court that will stand up on behalf of women's rights, on behalf of the rights of the LGBT community, that will stand up and say no to \uc2 Citizens United\uc2 , a decision that has undermined the \uc2 election\uc2  system in our country because of the way it permits dark, unaccountable money to come into our electoral system.\par \par \uc2 I have major disagreements with my opponent about these issues and others that will be before the Supreme Court. But I feel that at this point in our country's history, it is important that we not reverse marriage equality, that we not reverse Roe v. Wade, that we stand up against \uc2 Citizens United\uc2 , we stand up for the rights of people in the workplace, that we stand up and basically say: The Supreme Court should represent all of us.\par \par \uc2 That's how I see the court, and the kind of people that I would be looking to nominate to the court would be in the great tradition of standing up to the powerful, standing up on behalf of our rights as Americans.\par \par \uc2 And I look forward to having that opportunity. I would hope that the Senate would do its job and confirm the nominee that President Obama has sent to them. That's the way the Constitution fundamentally should operate. The president nominates, and then the Senate advises and consents, or not, but they go forward with the process.\par \par \uc2 WALLACE: Secretary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , thank you.\par \par \uc2 WALLACE: Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , same question. Where do you want to see the court take the country? And how do you believe the Constitution should be interpreted?\par \par \uc2 TRUMP\uc2 : Well, first of all, it's great to be with you, and thank you, everybody. The Supreme Court: It's what it's all about. Our country is so, so -- it's just so imperative that we have the right justices.\par \par \uc2 Something happened recently where Justice Ginsburg made some very, very inappropriate statements toward me and toward a tremendous number of people, many, many millions of people that I represent. And she was forced to apologize. And apologize she did. But these were statements that should never, ever have been made.\par \par \uc2 We need a Supreme Court that in my opinion is going to uphold the Second Amendment, and all amendments, but the Second Amendment, which is under absolute siege. I believe if my opponent should win this race, which I truly don't think will happen, we will have a Second Amendment which will be a very, very small replica of what it is right now. But I feel that it's absolutely important that we uphold, because of the fact that it is under such trauma.\par \par \uc2 I feel that the justices that I am going to appoint -- and I've named 20 of them -- the justices that I'm going to appoint will be pro-life. They will have a conservative bent. They will be protecting the Second Amendment. They are great scholars in all cases, and they're people of tremendous respect. They will interpret the Constitution the way the founders wanted it interpreted. And I believe that's very, very important.\par \par \uc2 I don't think we should have justices appointed that decide what they want to hear. It's all about the Constitution of -- of -- and so important, the Constitution the way it was meant to be. And those are the people that I will appoint.\par \par \uc2 WALLACE: Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , thank you.\par \par \uc2 WALLACE: We now have about 10 minutes for an open discussion. I want to focus on two issues that, in fact, by the justices that you name could end up changing the existing law of the land. First is one that you mentioned, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , and that is guns.\par \par \uc2 Secretary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , you said last year, let me quote, ''The Supreme Court is wrong on the Second Amendment.'' And now, in fact, in the 2008 Heller case, the court ruled that there is a constitutional right to bear arms, but a right that is reasonably limited. Those were the words of the Judge Antonin Scalia who wrote the decision. What's wrong with that?\par \par \uc2 CLINTON\uc2 : Well, first of all, I support the Second Amendment. I lived in Arkansas for 18 wonderful years. I represented upstate New York. I understand and respect the tradition of gun ownership. It goes back to the founding of our country.\par \par \uc2 But I also believe that there can be and must be reasonable regulation. Because I support the Second Amendment doesn't mean that I want people who shouldn't have guns to be able to threaten you, kill you or members of your family.\par \par \uc2 And so when I think about what we need to do, we have 33,000 people a year who die from guns. I think we need comprehensive background checks, need to close the online loophole, close the gun show loophole. There's other matters that I think are sensible that are the kind of reforms that would make a difference that are not in any way conflicting with the Second Amendment.\par \par \uc2 You mentioned the Heller decision. And what I was saying that you referenced, Chris, was that I disagreed with the way the court applied the Second Amendment in that case, because what the District of Columbia was trying to do was to protect toddlers from guns and so they wanted people with guns to safely store them. And the court didn't accept that reasonable regulation, but they've accepted many others. So I see no conflict between saving people's lives and defending the Second Amendment.\par \par \uc2 WALLACE: Let me bring Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  in here. The bipartisan Open Debate Coalition got millions of votes on questions to ask here, and this was, in fact, one of the top questions that they got. How will you ensure the Second Amendment is protected? You just heard Secretary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's answer. Does she persuade you that, while you may disagree on regulation, that, in fact, she supports a Second Amendment right to bear arms? \uc2 TRUMP\uc2 : Well, the D.C. vs. Heller decision was very strongly -- and she was extremely angry about it. I watched. I mean, she was very, very angry when upheld. And Justice Scalia was so involved. And it was a well-crafted decision. But Hillary was extremely upset, extremely angry. And people that believe in the Second Amendment and believe in it very strongly were very upset with what she had to say.\par \par \uc2 WALLACE: Well, let me bring in Secretary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 . Were you extremely upset?\par \par \uc2 CLINTON\uc2 : Well, I was upset because, unfortunately, dozens of toddlers injure themselves, even kill people with guns, because, unfortunately, not everyone who has loaded guns in their homes takes appropriate precautions.\par \par \uc2 But there's no doubt that I respect the Second Amendment, that I also believe there's an individual right to bear arms. That is not in conflict with sensible, commonsense regulation.\par \par \uc2 And, you know, look, I understand that Donald's been strongly supported by the \uc2 NRA\uc2 . The gun lobby's on his side. They're running millions of dollars of ads against me. And I regret that, because what I would like to see is for people to come together and say: Of course we're going to protect and defend the Second Amendment. But we're going to do it in a way that tries to save some of these 33,000 lives that we lose every year.\par \par \uc2 WALLACE: Let me bring Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  back into this, because, in fact, you oppose any limits on assault weapons, any limits on high- capacity magazines. You support a national right to carry law. Why, sir?\par \par \uc2 TRUMP\uc2 : Well, let me just tell you before we go any further. In Chicago, which has the toughest gun laws in the United States, probably you could say by far, they have more gun violence than any other city. So we have the toughest laws, and you have tremendous gun violence.\par \par \uc2 I am a very strong supporter of the Second Amendment. And I am -- I don't know if Hillary was saying it in a sarcastic manner, but I'm very proud to have the endorsement of the \uc2 NRA\uc2 . And it's the earliest endorsement they've ever given to anybody who ran for president. So I'm very honored by all of that.\par \par \uc2 We are going to appoint justices -- this is the best way to help the Second Amendment. We are going to appoint justices that will feel very strongly about the Second Amendment, that will not do damage to the Second Amendment.\par \par \uc2 WALLACE: Well, let's pick up on another issue which divides you and the justices that whoever ends up winning this \uc2 election\uc2  appoints could have a dramatic effect there, and that's the issue of abortion.\par \par \uc2 TRUMP\uc2 : Right.\par \par \uc2 WALLACE: Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , you're pro-life. But I want to ask you specifically: Do you want the court, including the justices that you will name, to overturn Roe v. Wade, which includes -- in fact, states -- a woman's right to abortion?\par \par \uc2 TRUMP\uc2 : Well, if that would happen, because I am pro-life, and I will be appointing pro-life judges, I would think that that will go back to the individual states.\par \par \uc2 WALLACE: But I'm asking you specifically. Would you like to...\par \par \uc2 TRUMP\uc2 : If they overturned it, it will go back to the states.\par \par \uc2 WALLACE: But what I'm asking you, sir, is, do you want to see the court overturn -- you just said you want to see the court protect the Second Amendment. Do you want to see the court overturn Roe v. Wade?\par \par \uc2 TRUMP\uc2 : Well, if we put another two or perhaps three justice on, that's really what's going to be -- that will happen. And that'll happen automatically, in my opinion, because I am putting pro-life justices on the court. I will say this: It will go back to the states, and the states will then make a determination.\par \par \uc2 WALLACE: Secretary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 ?\par \par \uc2 CLINTON\uc2 : Well, I strongly support Roe v. Wade, which guarantees a constitutional right to a woman to make the most intimate, most difficult, in many cases, decisions about her health care that one can imagine. And in this case, it's not only about Roe v. Wade. It is about what's happening right now in America.\par \par \uc2 So many states are putting very stringent regulations on women that block them from exercising that choice to the extent that they are defunding \uc2 Planned Parenthood\uc2 , which, of course, provides all kinds of cancer screenings and other benefits for women in our country.\par \par \uc2 Donald has said he's in favor of defunding \uc2 Planned Parenthood\uc2 . He even supported shutting the government down to defund \uc2 Planned Parenthood\uc2 . I will defend \uc2 Planned Parenthood\uc2 . I will defend Roe v. Wade, and I will defend women's rights to make their own health care decisions.\par \par \uc2 WALLACE: Secretary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 ... \uc2 CLINTON\uc2 : And we have come too far to have that turned back now. And, indeed, he said women should be punished, that there should be some form of punishment for women who obtain abortions. And I could just not be more opposed to that kind of thinking.\par \par \uc2 WALLACE: I'm going to give you a chance to respond, but I want to ask you, Secretary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , I want to explore how far you believe the right to abortion goes. You have been quoted as saying that the fetus has no constitutional rights. You also voted against a ban on late-term, partial-birth abortions. Why?\par \par \uc2 CLINTON\uc2 : Because Roe v. Wade very clearly sets out that there can be regulations on abortion so long as the life and the health of the mother are taken into account. And when I voted as a senator, I did not think that that was the case.\par \par \uc2 The kinds of cases that fall at the end of pregnancy are often the most heartbreaking, painful decisions for families to make. I have met with women who toward the end of their pregnancy get the worst news one could get, that their health is in jeopardy if they continue to carry to term or that something terrible has happened or just been discovered about the pregnancy. I do not think the United States government should be stepping in and making those most personal of decisions. So you can regulate if you are doing so with the life and the health of the mother taken into account.\par \par \uc2 WALLACE: Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , your reaction? And particularly on this issue of late-term, partial-birth abortions.\par \par \uc2 TRUMP\uc2 : Well, I think it's terrible. If you go with what Hillary is saying, in the ninth month, you can take the baby and rip the baby out of the womb of the mother just prior to the birth of the baby.\par \par \uc2 Now, you can say that that's OK and Hillary can say that that's OK. But it's not OK with me, because based on what she's saying, and based on where she's going, and where she's been, you can take the baby and rip the baby out of the womb in the ninth month on the final day. And that's not acceptable.\par \par \uc2 CLINTON\uc2 : Well, that is not what happens in these cases. And using that kind of scare rhetoric is just terribly unfortunate. You should meet with some of the women that I have met with, women I have known over the course of my life. This is one of the worst possible choices that any woman and her family has to make. And I do not believe the government should be making it.\par \par \uc2 You know, I've had the great honor of traveling across the world on behalf of our country. I've been to countries where governments either forced women to have abortions, like they used to do in China, or forced women to bear children, like they used to do in Romania. And I can tell you: The government has no business in the decisions that women make with their families in accordance with their faith, with medical advice. And I will stand up for that right.\par \par \uc2 WALLACE: All right. But just briefly, I want to move on to another segment...\par \par \uc2 TRUMP\uc2 : And, honestly, nobody has business doing what I just said, doing that, as late as one or two or three or four days prior to birth. Nobody has that.\par \par \uc2 WALLACE: All right. Let's move on to the subject of immigration. And there is almost no issue that separates the two of you more than the issue of immigration. Actually, there are a lot of issues that separate the two of you.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , you want to build a wall. Secretary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , you have offered no specific plan for how you want to secure our southern border. Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , you are calling for major deportations. Secretary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , you say that within your first 100 days as president you're going to offer a package that includes a pathway to citizenship. The question, really, is, why are you right and your opponent wrong?\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , you go first in this segment. You have two minutes.\par \par \uc2 TRUMP\uc2 : Well, first of all, she wants to give amnesty, which is a disaster and very unfair to all of the people that are waiting on line for many, many years. We need strong borders.\par \par \uc2 In the audience tonight, we have four mothers of -- I mean, these are unbelievable people that I've gotten to know over a period of years whose children have been killed, brutally killed by people that came into the country illegally. You have thousands of mothers and fathers and relatives all over the country. They're coming in illegally. Drugs are pouring in through the border. We have no country if we have no border.\par \par \uc2 Hillary wants to give amnesty. She wants to have open borders. The border -- as you know, the Border Patrol agents, 16,500-plus \uc2 ICE\uc2  last week, endorsed me. First time they've ever endorsed a candidate. It means their job is tougher. But they know what's going on. They know it better than anybody. They want strong borders. They feel we have to have strong borders.\par \par \uc2 I was up in New Hampshire the other day. The biggest complaint they have -- it's with all of the problems going on in the world, many of the problems caused by \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  and by \uc2 Barack Obama\uc2 . All of the problems -- the single biggest problem is heroin that pours across our southern border. It's just pouring and destroying their youth. It's poisoning the blood of their youth and plenty of other people. We have to have strong borders. We have to keep the drugs out of our country. We are -- right now, we're getting the drugs, they're getting the cash. We need strong borders. We need absolute -- we cannot give amnesty.\par \par \uc2 Now, I want to build the wall. We need the wall. And the Border Patrol, \uc2 ICE\uc2 , they all want the wall. We stop the drugs. We shore up the border. One of my first acts will be to get all of the drug lords, all of the bad ones -- we have some bad, bad people in this country that have to go out. We're going to get them out; we're going to secure the border. And once the border is secured, at a later date, we'll make a determination as to the rest. But we have some bad hombres here, and we're going to get them out.\par \par \uc2 WALLACE: Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , thank you. Same question to you, Secretary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 . Basically, why are you right and Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  is wrong?\par \par \uc2 CLINTON\uc2 : Well, as he was talking, I was thinking about a young girl I met here in Las Vegas, Carla, who is very worried that her parents might be deported, because she was born in this country but they were not. They work hard, they do everything they can to give her a good life.\par \par \uc2 And you're right. I don't want to rip families apart. I don't want to be sending parents away from children. I don't want to see the deportation force that Donald has talked about in action in our country.\par \par \uc2 We have 11 million undocumented people. They have 4 million American citizen children, 15 million people. He said as recently as a few weeks ago in Phoenix that every undocumented person would be subject to deportation. Now, here's what that means. It means you would have to have a massive law enforcement presence, where law enforcement officers would be going school to school, home to home, business to business, rounding up people who are undocumented. And we would then have to put them on trains, on buses to get them out of our country.\par \par \uc2 I think that is an idea that is not in keeping with who we are as a nation. I think it's an idea that would rip our country apart.\par \par \uc2 I have been for border security for years. I voted for border security in the \uc2 United States Senate\uc2 . And my comprehensive immigration reform plan of course includes border security. But I want to put our resources where I think they're most needed: Getting rid of any violent person. Anybody who should be deported, we should deport them.\par \par \uc2 When it comes to the wall that Donald talks about building, he went to Mexico, he had a meeting with the Mexican president. Didn't even raise it. He choked and then got into a \uc2 Twitter\uc2  war because the Mexican president said we're not paying for that wall.\par \par \uc2 So I think we are both a nation of immigrants and we are a nation of laws and that we can act accordingly. And that's why I'm introducing comprehensive immigration reform within the first 100 days with the path to citizenship.\par \par \uc2 WALLACE: Thank you, Secretary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 . I want to follow up...\par \par \uc2 TRUMP\uc2 : Chris, I think it's...\par \par \uc2 WALLACE: OK.\par \par \uc2 TRUMP\uc2 : I think I should respond to that. First of all, I had a very good meeting with the president of Mexico. Very nice man. We will be doing very much better with Mexico on trade deals. Believe me. The \uc2 NAFTA\uc2  deal signed by her husband is one of the worst deals ever made of any kind, signed by anybody. It's a disaster.\par \par \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  wanted the wall. \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  fought for the wall in 2006 or thereabouts. Now, she never gets anything done, so naturally the wall wasn't built. But \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  wanted the wall.\par \par \uc2 WALLACE: Well, let me -- wait, wait, sir, let me...\par \par \uc2 TRUMP\uc2 : We are a country of laws. We either have -- and by the way...\par \par \uc2 WALLACE: Now, wait. I'd like to hear from...\par \par \uc2 TRUMP\uc2 : Well -- well, but she said one thing.\par \par \uc2 WALLACE: I'd like to hear -- I'd like to hear from Secretary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 CLINTON\uc2 : I voted for border security, and there are...\par \par \uc2 TRUMP\uc2 : And the wall.\par \par \uc2 CLINTON\uc2 : There are some limited places where that was appropriate. There also is necessarily going to be new technology and how best to deploy that.\par \par \uc2 But it is clear, when you look at what Donald has been proposing, he started his campaign bashing immigrants, calling Mexican immigrants rapists and criminals and drug dealers, that he has a very different view about what we should do to deal with immigrants.\par \par \uc2 Now, what I am also arguing is that bringing undocumented immigrants out from the shadows, putting them into the formal economy will be good, because then employers can't exploit them and undercut Americans' wages.\par \par \uc2 And Donald knows a lot about this. He used undocumented labor to build the \uc2 Trump\uc2  Tower. He underpaid undocumented workers, and when they complained, he basically said what a lot of employers do: ''You complain, I'll get you deported.''\par \par \uc2 I want to get everybody out of the shadows, get the economy working, and not let employers like Donald exploit undocumented workers, which hurts them, but also hurts American workers.\par \par \uc2 WALLACE: Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 ?\par \par \uc2 TRUMP\uc2 : President Obama has moved millions of people out. Nobody knows about it, nobody talks about it. But under Obama, millions of people have been moved out of this country. They've been deported. She doesn't want to say that, but that's what's happened, and that's what happened big league.\par \par \uc2 As far as moving these people out and moving -- we either have a country or we don't. We're a country of laws. We either have a border or we don't.\par \par \uc2 Now, you can come back in and you can become a citizen. But it's very unfair. We have millions of people that did it the right way. They're on line. They're waiting. We're going to speed up the process, big league, because it's very inefficient. But they're on line and they're waiting to become citizens.\par \par \uc2 Very unfair that somebody runs across the border, becomes a citizen, under her plan, you have open borders. You would have a disaster on trade, and you will have a disaster with your open borders.\par \par \uc2 WALLACE: I want to...\par \par \uc2 TRUMP\uc2 : But what she doesn't say is that President Obama has deported millions and millions of people just the way it is.\par \par \uc2 WALLACE: Secretary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , I want to...\par \par \uc2 CLINTON\uc2 : We will not have open borders. That is...\par \par \uc2 WALLACE: Well, let me -- Secretary...\par \par \uc2 CLINTON\uc2 : That is a rank mischaracterization.\par \par \uc2 WALLACE: Secretary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 ...\par \par \uc2 CLINTON\uc2 : We will have secure borders, but we'll also have reform. And this used to be a bipartisan issue. Ronald Reagan was the last president...\par \par \uc2 WALLACE: Secretary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , excuse me. Secretary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 CLINTON\uc2 : ... to sign immigration reform, and George W. Bush supported it, as well.\par \par \uc2 WALLACE: Secretary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , I want to clear up your position on this issue, because in a speech you gave to a Brazilian bank, for which you were paid $225,000, we've learned from the \uc2 WikiLeaks\uc2 , that you said this, and I want to quote. ''My dream is a hemispheric common market with open trade and open borders.'' So that's the question...\par \par \uc2 TRUMP\uc2 : Thank you.\par \par \uc2 WALLACE: That's the question. Please quiet, everybody. Is that your dream, open borders? \uc2 CLINTON\uc2 : Well, if you went on to read the rest of the sentence, I was talking about energy. You know, we trade more energy with our neighbors than we trade with the rest of the world combined. And I do want us to have an electric grid, an energy system that crosses borders. I think that would be a great benefit to us.\par \par \uc2 But you are very clearly quoting from \uc2 WikiLeaks\uc2 . And what's really important about \uc2 WikiLeaks\uc2  is that the Russian government has engaged in espionage against Americans. They have hacked American websites, American accounts of private people, of institutions. Then they have given that information to \uc2 WikiLeaks\uc2  for the purpose of putting it on the Internet.\par \par \uc2 This has come from the highest levels of the Russian government, clearly, from Putin himself, in an effort, as 17 of our intelligence agencies have confirmed, to influence our \uc2 election\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 CLINTON\uc2 : So I actually think the most important question of this evening, Chris, is, finally, will \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  admit and condemn that the Russians are doing this and make it clear that he will not have the help of Putin in in this \uc2 election\uc2 , that he rejects Russian espionage against Americans, which he actually encouraged in the past? Those are the questions we need answered. We've never had anything like this happen in any of our elections before.\par \par \uc2 WALLACE: Well?\par \par \uc2 TRUMP\uc2 : That was a great pivot off the fact that she wants open borders, OK? How did we get on to Putin?\par \par \uc2 WALLACE: Hold on -- hold on, wait. Hold on, folks. Because we -- this is going to end up getting out of control. Let's try to keep it quiet so -- for the candidates and for the American people.\par \par \uc2 TRUMP\uc2 : So just to finish on the borders...\par \par \uc2 WALLACE: Yes?\par \par \uc2 TRUMP\uc2 : She wants open borders. People are going to pour into our country. People are going to come in from Syria. She wants 550 percent more people than \uc2 Barack Obama\uc2 , and he has thousands and thousands of people. They have no idea where they come from.\par \par \uc2 And you see, we are going to stop radical Islamic terrorism in this country. She won't even mention the words, and neither will President Obama. So I just want to tell you, she wants open borders.\par \par \uc2 Now we can talk about Putin. I don't know Putin. He said nice things about me. If we got along well, that would be good. If Russia and the United States got along well and went after ISIS, that would be good.\par \par \uc2 He has no respect for her. He has no respect for our president. And I'll tell you what: We're in very serious trouble, because we have a country with tremendous numbers of nuclear warheads -- 1,800, by the way -- where they expanded and we didn't, 1,800 nuclear warheads. And she's playing chicken. Look, Putin...\par \par \uc2 WALLACE: Wait, but...\par \par \uc2 TRUMP\uc2 : ... from everything I see, has no respect for this person.\par \par \uc2 CLINTON\uc2 : Well, that's because he'd rather have a puppet as president of the United States.\par \par \uc2 TRUMP\uc2 : No puppet. No puppet.\par \par \uc2 CLINTON\uc2 : And it's pretty clear...\par \par \uc2 TRUMP\uc2 : You're the puppet!\par \par \uc2 CLINTON\uc2 : It's pretty clear you won't admit...\par \par \uc2 TRUMP\uc2 : No, you're the puppet.\par \par \uc2 CLINTON\uc2 : ... that the Russians have engaged in cyberattacks against the United States of America, that you encouraged espionage against our people, that you are willing to spout the Putin line, sign up for his wish list, break up \uc2 NATO\uc2 , do whatever he wants to do, and that you continue to get help from him, because he has a very clear favorite in this race.\par \par \uc2 So I think that this is such an unprecedented situation. We've never had a foreign government trying to interfere in our \uc2 election\uc2 . We have 17 -- 17 intelligence agencies, civilian and military, who have all concluded that these espionage attacks, these cyberattacks, come from the highest levels of the Kremlin and they are designed to influence our \uc2 election\uc2 . I find that deeply disturbing.\par \par \uc2 WALLACE: Secretary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 ...\par \par \uc2 CLINTON\uc2 : And I think it's time you take a stand...\par \par \uc2 TRUMP\uc2 : She has no idea whether it's Russia, China, or anybody else.\par \par \uc2 CLINTON\uc2 : I am not quoting myself.\par \par \uc2 TRUMP\uc2 : She has no idea.\par \par \uc2 CLINTON\uc2 : I am quoting 17...\par \par \uc2 TRUMP\uc2 : Hillary, you have no idea.\par \par \uc2 CLINTON\uc2 : ... 17 intelligence -- do you doubt 17 military and civilian...\par \par \uc2 TRUMP\uc2 : And our country has no idea.\par \par \uc2 CLINTON\uc2 : ... agencies.\par \par \uc2 TRUMP\uc2 : Yeah, I doubt it. I doubt it.\par \par \uc2 CLINTON\uc2 : Well, he'd rather believe \uc2 Vladimir Putin\uc2  than the military and civilian intelligence professionals who are sworn to protect us. I find that just absolutely...\par \par \uc2 (CROSSTALK)\par \par \uc2 TRUMP\uc2 : She doesn't like Putin because Putin has outsmarted her at every step of the way.\par \par \uc2 WALLACE: Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 ...\par \par \uc2 TRUMP\uc2 : Excuse me. Putin has outsmarted her in Syria.\par \par \uc2 WALLACE: Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 ...\par \par \uc2 (CROSSTALK)\par \par \uc2 TRUMP\uc2 : He's outsmarted her every step of the way.\par \par \uc2 WALLACE: I do get to ask some questions.\par \par \uc2 TRUMP\uc2 : Yes, that's fine.\par \par \uc2 WALLACE: And I would like to ask you this direct question. The top national security officials of this country do believe that Russia has been behind these hacks. Even if you don't know for sure whether they are, do you condemn any interference by Russia in the American \uc2 election\uc2 ?\par \par \uc2 TRUMP\uc2 : By Russia or anybody else.\par \par \uc2 WALLACE: You condemn their interference?\par \par \uc2 TRUMP\uc2 : Of course I condemn. Of course I -- I don't know Putin. I have no idea.\par \par \uc2 WALLACE: I'm not asking -- I'm asking do you condemn?\par \par \uc2 TRUMP\uc2 : I never met Putin. This is not my best friend. But if the United States got along with Russia, wouldn't be so bad.\par \par \uc2 Let me tell you, Putin has outsmarted her and Obama at every single step of the way. Whether it's Syria, you name it. Missiles. Take a look at the ''start up'' that they signed. The Russians have said, according to many, many reports, I can't believe they allowed us to do this. They create warheads, and we can't. The Russians can't believe it. She has been outsmarted by Putin.\par \par \uc2 And all you have to do is look at the Middle East. They've taken over. We've spent $6 trillion. They've taken over the Middle East. She has been outsmarted and outplayed worse than anybody I've ever seen in any government whatsoever.\par \par \uc2 WALLACE: We're a long way away from immigration, but I'm going to let you finish this topic. You got about 45 seconds.\par \par \uc2 TRUMP\uc2 : And she always will be.\par \par \uc2 CLINTON\uc2 : I -- I find it ironic that he's raising nuclear weapons. This is a person who has been very cavalier, even casual about the use of nuclear weapons. He's...\par \par \uc2 TRUMP\uc2 : Wrong. \uc2 CLINTON\uc2 : ... advocated more countries getting them, Japan, Korea, even Saudi Arabia. He said, well, if we have them, why don't we use them, which I think is terrifying.\par \par \uc2 But here's the deal. The bottom line on nuclear weapons is that when the president gives the order, it must be followed. There's about four minutes between the order being given and the people responsible for launching nuclear weapons to do so. And that's why 10 people who have had that awesome responsibility have come out and, in an unprecedented way, said they would not trust \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  with the nuclear codes or to have his finger on the nuclear button.\par \par \uc2 TRUMP\uc2 : I have 200 generals...\par \par \uc2 WALLACE: Very quickly.\par \par \uc2 TRUMP\uc2 : ... and admirals, 21 endorsing me, 21 congressional Medal of Honor recipients. As far as Japan and other countries, we are being ripped off by everybody in the -- we're defending other countries. We are spending a fortune doing it. They have the bargain of the century.\par \par \uc2 All I said is, we have to renegotiate these agreements, because our country cannot afford to defend Saudi Arabia, Japan, Germany, South Korea, and many other places. We cannot continue to afford -- she took that as saying nuclear weapons.\par \par \uc2 WALLACE: OK.\par \par \uc2 TRUMP\uc2 : Look, she's been proven to be a liar on so many different ways. This is just another lie.\par \par \uc2 CLINTON\uc2 : Well, I'm just quoting you when you were asked...\par \par \uc2 TRUMP\uc2 : There's no quote. You're not going to find a quote from me.\par \par \uc2 CLINTON\uc2 : ... about a potential nuclear -- nuclear competition in Asia, you said, you know, go ahead, enjoy yourselves, folks. That kind...\par \par \uc2 TRUMP\uc2 : And defend yourselves.\par \par \uc2 CLINTON\uc2 : ... of language -- well...\par \par \uc2 TRUMP\uc2 : And defend yourselves. I didn't say nuclear. And defend yourself.\par \par \uc2 CLINTON\uc2 : The United States has kept the peace -- the United States has kept the peace through our alliances. Donald wants to tear up our alliances. I think it makes the world safer and, frankly, it makes the United States safer. I would work with our allies in Asia, in Europe, in the Middle East, and elsewhere. That's the only way we're going to be able to keep the peace.\par \par \uc2 WALLACE: We're going to -- no, we are going to move on to the next topic, which is the economy. And I hope we handle that as well as we did immigration. You also have very different ideas about how to get the economy growing faster. Secretary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , in your plan, government plays a big role. You see more government spending, more entitlements, more tax credits, more tax penalties. Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , you want to get government out with lower taxes and less regulation.\par \par \uc2 TRUMP\uc2 : Yes.\par \par \uc2 WALLACE: We're going to drill down into this a little bit more. But in this overview, please explain to me why you believe that your plan will create more jobs and growth for this country and your opponent's plan will not. In this round, you go first, Secretary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 CLINTON\uc2 : Well, I think when the middle class thrives, America thrives. And so my plan is based on growing the economy, giving middle-class families many more opportunities. I want us to have the biggest jobs program since World War II, jobs in infrastructure and advanced manufacturing. I think we can compete with high-wage countries, and I believe we should. New jobs and clean energy, not only to fight climate change, which is a serious problem, but to create new opportunities and new businesses.\par \par \uc2 I want us to do more to help small business. That's where two- thirds of the new jobs are going to come from. I want us to raise the national minimum wage, because people who live in poverty should not -- who work full-time should not still be in poverty. And I sure do want to make sure women get equal pay for the work we do.\par \par \uc2 I feel strongly that we have to have an education system that starts with preschool and goes through college. That's why I want more technical education in high schools and in community colleges, real apprenticeships to prepare young people for the jobs of the future. I want to make college debt-free and for families making less than $125,000, you will not get a tuition bill from a public college or university if the plan that I worked on with Bernie Sanders is enacted.\par \par \uc2 And we're going to work hard to make sure that it is, because we are going to go where the money is. Most of the gains in the last years since the Great Recession have gone to the very top. So we are going to have the wealthy pay their fair share. We're going to have corporations make a contribution greater than they are now to our country.\par \par \uc2 That is a plan that has been analyzed by independent experts which said that it could produce 10 million new jobs. By contrast, Donald's plan has been analyzed to conclude it might lose 3.5 million jobs. Why? Because his whole plan is to cut taxes, to give the biggest tax breaks ever to the wealthy and to corporations, adding $20 trillion to our debt, and causing the kind of dislocation that we have seen before, because it truly will be trickle-down economics on steroids.\par \par \uc2 So the plan I have I think will actually produce greater opportunities. The plan he has will cost us jobs and possibly lead to another Great Recession.\par \par \uc2 WALLACE: Secretary, thank you. Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , why will your plan create more jobs and growth than Secretary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's?\par \par \uc2 TRUMP\uc2 : Well, first of all, before I start on my plan, her plan is going to raise taxes and even double your taxes. Her tax plan is a disaster. And she can say all she wants about college tuition. And I'm a big proponent. We're going to do a lot of things for college tuition. But the rest of the public's going to be paying for it. We will have a massive, massive tax increase under \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's plan.\par \par \uc2 TRUMP\uc2 : But I'd like to start off where we left, because when I said Japan and Germany, and I'm -- not to single them out, but South Korea, these are very rich, powerful countries. Saudi Arabia, nothing but money. We protect Saudi Arabia. Why aren't they paying?\par \par \uc2 She immediately -- when she heard this, I questioned it, and I questioned \uc2 NATO\uc2 . Why aren't the \uc2 NATO\uc2  questioned -- why aren't they paying? Because they weren't paying.\par \par \uc2 Since I did this -- this was a year ago -- all of a sudden, they're paying. And I've been given a lot -- a lot of credit for it. All of a sudden, they're starting to pay up. They have to pay up. We're protecting people, they have to pay up. And I'm a big fan of \uc2 NATO\uc2 . But they have to pay up.\par \par \uc2 She comes out and said, we love our allies, we think our allies are great. Well, it's awfully hard to get them to pay up when you have somebody saying we think how great they are.\par \par \uc2 We have to tell Japan in a very nice way, we have to tell Germany, all of these countries, South Korea, we have to say, you have to help us out. We have, during his regime, during President Obama's regime, we've doubled our national debt. We're up to $20 trillion.\par \par \uc2 So my plan -- we're going to renegotiate trade deals. We're going to have a lot of free trade. We're going to have free trade, more free trade than we have right now. But we have horrible deals. Our jobs are being taken out by the deal that her husband signed, \uc2 NAFTA\uc2 , one of the worst deals ever. Our jobs are being sucked out of our economy.\par \par \uc2 You look at all of the places that I just left, you go to Pennsylvania, you go to Ohio, you go to Florida, you go to any of them. You go upstate New York. Our jobs have fled to Mexico and other places. We're bringing our jobs back.\par \par \uc2 I am going to renegotiate \uc2 NAFTA\uc2 . And if I can't make a great deal -- then we're going to terminate \uc2 NAFTA\uc2  and we're going to create new deals. We're going to have trade, but we're going -- we're going to terminate it, we're going to make a great trade deal.\par \par \uc2 And if we can't, we're going to do it -- we're going to go a separate way, because it has been a disaster. We are going to cut taxes massively. We're going to cut business taxes massively. They're going to start hiring people. We're going to bring the $2.5 trillion... WALLACE: Time, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 TRUMP\uc2 : ... that's offshore back into the country. We are going to start the engine rolling again, because...\par \par \uc2 WALLACE: Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 ?\par \par \uc2 TRUMP\uc2 : ... right now, our country is dying at 1 percent GDP.\par \par \uc2 CLINTON\uc2 : Well, let me translate that, if I can, Chris, because...\par \par \uc2 TRUMP\uc2 : You can't.\par \par \uc2 CLINTON\uc2 : ... the fact is, he's going to advocate for the largest tax cuts we've ever seen, three times more than the tax cuts under the Bush administration. I have said repeatedly throughout this campaign: I will not raise taxes on anyone making $250,000 or less.\par \par \uc2 I also will not add a penny to the debt. I have costed out what I'm going to do. He will, through his massive tax cuts, add $20 trillion to the debt.\par \par \uc2 Well, he mentioned the debt. We know how to get control of the debt. When my husband was president, we went from a $300 billion deficit to a $200 billion surplus and we were actually on the path to eliminating the national debt. When President Obama came into office, he inherited the worst economic disaster since the Great Depression. He has cut the deficit by two-thirds.\par \par \uc2 So, yes, one of the ways you go after the debt, one of the ways you create jobs is by investing in people. So I do have investments, investments in new jobs, investments in education, skill training, and the opportunities for people to get ahead and stay ahead. That's the kind of approach that will work.\par \par \uc2 WALLACE: Secretary...\par \par \uc2 CLINTON\uc2 : Cutting taxes on the wealthy, we've tried that. It has not worked the way that it has been promised.\par \par \uc2 WALLACE: Secretary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , I want to pursue your plan, because in many ways it is similar to the Obama stimulus plan in 2009, which has led to the slowest GDP growth since 1949.\par \par \uc2 TRUMP\uc2 : Correct.\par \par \uc2 WALLACE: Thank you, sir.\par \par \uc2 You told me in July when we spoke that the problem is that President Obama didn't get to do enough in what he was trying to do with his stimulus. So is your plan basically more -- even more of the Obama stimulus?\par \par \uc2 CLINTON\uc2 : Well, it's a combination, Chris. And let me say that when you inherit the level of economic catastrophe that President Obama inherited, it was a real touch-and-go situation. I was in the Senate before I became secretary of state. I've never seen people as physically distraught as the Bush administration team was because of what was happening to the economy.\par \par \uc2 I personally believe that the steps that President Obama took saved the economy. He doesn't get the credit he deserves for taking some very hard positions. But it was a terrible recession.\par \par \uc2 So now we've dug ourselves out of it, we're standing, but we're not yet running. So what I am proposing is that we invest from the middle out and the ground up, not the top down. That is not going to work.\par \par \uc2 That's why what I have put forward doesn't add a penny to the debt, but it is the kind of approach that will enable more people to take those new jobs, higher-paying jobs. We're beginning to see some increase in incomes, and we certainly have had a long string of increasing jobs. We've got to do more to get the whole economy moving, and that's what I believe I will be able to do.\par \par \uc2 WALLACE: Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , even conservative economists who have looked at your plan say that the numbers don't add up, that your idea, and you've talked about 25 million jobs created, 4 percent...\par \par \uc2 TRUMP\uc2 : Over a 10-year period.\par \par \uc2 WALLACE: ... growth is unrealistic. And they say -- you talk a lot about growing the energy industry. They say with oil prices as low as they are right now, that's unrealistic, as well. Your response, sir?\par \par \uc2 TRUMP\uc2 : So I just left some high representatives of India. They're growing at 8 percent. China is growing at 7 percent. And that for them is a catastrophically low number.\par \par \uc2 We are growing -- our last report came out -- and it's right around the 1 percent level. And I think it's going down. Last week, as you know, the end of last week, they came out with an anemic jobs report. A terrible jobs report. In fact I said, is that the last jobs report before the \uc2 election\uc2 ? Because if it is, I should win easily, it was so bad. The report was so bad.\par \par \uc2 Look, our country is stagnant. We've lost our jobs. We've lost our businesses. We're not making things anymore, relatively speaking. Our product is pouring in from China, pouring in from Vietnam, pouring in from all over the world.\par \par \uc2 I've visited so many communities. This has been such an incredible education for me, Chris. I've gotten to know so many -- I've developed so many friends over the last year. And they cry when they see what's happened. I pass factories that were thriving 20, 25 years ago, and because of the bill that her husband signed and she blessed 100 percent, it is just horrible what's happened to these people in these communities.\par \par \uc2 Now, she can say that her husband did well, but, boy, did they suffer as \uc2 NAFTA\uc2  kicked in, because it didn't really kick in very much, but it kicked in after they left. Boy, did they suffer. That was one of the worst things that's ever been signed by our country.\par \par \uc2 Now she wants to sign Trans-Pacific Partnership. And she wants it. She lied when she said she didn't call it the gold standard in one of the debates. She totally lied. She did call it the gold standard. And they actually fact checked, and they said I was right. I was so honored.\par \par \uc2 WALLACE: I want you to give you a chance to briefly speak to that, and then I want to pivot to one-sixth of the economy...\par \par \uc2 TRUMP\uc2 : And that will be as bad as \uc2 NAFTA\uc2 . WALLACE: ... which is Obamacare. But go ahead, briefly.\par \par \uc2 CLINTON\uc2 : Well, first, let me say, number one, when I saw the final agreement for TPP, I said I was against it. It didn't meet my test. I've had the same test. Does it create jobs, raise incomes, and further our national security? I'm against it now. I'll be against it after the \uc2 election\uc2 . I'll be against it when I'm president.\par \par \uc2 There's only one of us on this stage who's actually shipped jobs to Mexico, because that's Donald. He's shipped jobs to 12 countries, including Mexico.\par \par \uc2 But he mentioned China. And, you know, one of the biggest problems we have with China is the illegal dumping of steel and aluminum into our markets. I have fought against that as a senator. I've stood up against it as secretary of state.\par \par \uc2 Donald has bought Chinese steel and aluminum. In fact, the \uc2 Trump\uc2  Hotel right here in Las Vegas was made with Chinese steel. So he goes around with crocodile tears about how terrible it is, but he has given jobs to Chinese steelworkers, not American steelworkers.\par \par \uc2 WALLACE: Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 ?\par \par \uc2 CLINTON\uc2 : That's the kind of approach that is just not going to work.\par \par \uc2 TRUMP\uc2 : Well, let me just say -- let me just say.\par \par \uc2 CLINTON\uc2 : We're going to pull the country together. We're going to have trade agreements that we enforce. That's why I'm going to have a trade prosecutor for the first time in history. And we're going to enforce those agreements, and we're going to look for businesses to help us by buying American products.\par \par \uc2 WALLACE: Secretary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 ? Go ahead, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 TRUMP\uc2 : Let me ask a simple question. She's been doing this for 30 years. Why the hell didn't you do it over the last 15, 20 years?\par \par \uc2 CLINTON\uc2 : No, I voted.\par \par \uc2 TRUMP\uc2 : You were very much involved -- excuse me. My turn. You were very much involved in every aspect of this country. Very much. And you do have experience. I say the one thing you have over me is experience, but it's bad experience, because what you've done has turned out badly.\par \par \uc2 For 30 years, you've been in a position to help, and if you say that I use steel or I use something else, I -- make it impossible for me to do that. I wouldn't mind.\par \par \uc2 The problem is, you talk, but you don't get anything done, Hillary. You don't. Just like when you ran the State Department, $6 billion was missing. How do you miss $6 billion? You ran the State Department, $6 billion was either stolen. They don't know. It's gone, $6 billion. If you become president, this country is going to be in some mess. Believe me.\par \par \uc2 CLINTON\uc2 : Well, first of all, what he just said about the State Department is not only untrue, it's been debunked numerous times.\par \par \uc2 CLINTON\uc2 : But I think it's really an important issue. He raised the 30 years of experience, so let me just talk briefly about that. You know, back in the 1970s, I worked for the \uc2 Children's Defense Fund\uc2 . And I was taking on discrimination against African-American kids in schools. He was getting sued by the Justice Department for racial discrimination in his apartment buildings.\par \par \uc2 In the 1980s, I was working to reform the schools in Arkansas. He was borrowing $14 million from his father to start his businesses. In the 1990s, I went to Beijing and I said women's rights are human rights. He insulted a former Miss Universe, Alicia Machado, called her an eating machine.\par \par \uc2 TRUMP\uc2 : Give me a break.\par \par \uc2 CLINTON\uc2 : And on the day when I was in the Situation Room, monitoring the raid that brought Osama bin Laden to justice, he was hosting the ''Celebrity Apprentice.'' So I'm happy to compare my 30 years of experience, what I've done for this country, trying to help in every way I could, especially kids and families get ahead and stay ahead, with your 30 years, and I'll let the American people make that decision.\par \par \uc2 TRUMP\uc2 : Well, I think I did a much better job. I built a massive company, a great company, some of the greatest assets anywhere in the world, worth many, many billions of dollars. I started with a $1 million loan. I agree with that. It's a $1 million loan. But I built a phenomenal company.\par \par \uc2 And if we could run our country the way I've run my company, we would have a country that you would be so proud of. You would even be proud of it.\par \par \uc2 And frankly, when you look at her real record, take a look at Syria. Take a look at the migration. Take a look at Libya. Take a look at Iraq. She gave us ISIS, because her and Obama created this huge vacuum, and a small group came out of that huge vacuum because when -- we should never have been in Iraq, but once we were there, we should have never got out the way they wanted to get out. She gave us ISIS as sure as you are sitting there. And what happened is now ISIS is in 32 countries. And now I listen how she's going to get rid of ISIS. She's going to get rid of nobody.\par \par \uc2 WALLACE: All right. We are going to get to foreign hot spots in a few moments, but the next segment is fitness to be president of the United States. Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , at the last debate, you said your talk about grabbing women was just that, talk, and that you'd never actually done it. And since then, as we all know, nine women have come forward and have said that you either groped them or kissed them without their consent.\par \par \uc2 Why would so many different women from so many different circumstances over so many different years, why would they all in this last couple of weeks make up -- you deny this -- why would they all make up these stories?\par \par \uc2 Since this is a question for both of you, Secretary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  says what your husband did and that you defended was even worse. Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , you go first.\par \par \uc2 TRUMP\uc2 : Well, first of all, those stories have been largely debunked. Those people -- I don't know those people. I have a feeling how they came. I believe it was her campaign that did it.\par \par \uc2 Just like if you look at what came out today on the clips where I was wondering what happened with my rally in Chicago and other rallies where we had such violence? She's the one and Obama that caused the violence. They hired people -- they paid them $1,500, and they're on tape saying be violent, cause fights, do bad things.\par \par \uc2 I would say the only way -- because those stories are all totally false, I have to say that. And I didn't even apologize to my wife, who's sitting right here, because I didn't do anything. I didn't know any of these -- I didn't see these women.\par \par \uc2 These women -- the woman on the plane, the -- I think they want either fame or her campaign did it. And I think it's her campaign. Because what I saw what they did, which is a criminal act, by the way, where they're telling people to go out and start fist-fights and start violence.\par \par \uc2 And I'll tell you what, in particular in Chicago, people were hurt and people could have been killed in that riot. And that was now all on tape, started by her. I believe, Chris, that she got these people to step forward. If it wasn't, they get their 10 minutes of fame. But they were all totally -- it was all fiction. It was lies, and it was fiction.\par \par \uc2 CLINTON\uc2 : Well...\par \par \uc2 WALLACE: Secretary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 ?\par \par \uc2 CLINTON\uc2 : At the last debate, we heard Donald talking about what he did to women. And after that, a number of women have come forward saying that's exactly what he did to them. Now, what was his response? Well, he held a number of big rallies where he said that he could not possibly have done those things to those women because they were not attractive enough for them to be assaulted.\par \par \uc2 TRUMP\uc2 : I did not say that. I did not say that.\par \par \uc2 CLINTON\uc2 : In fact, he went on to say... WALLACE: Her two minutes -- sir, her two minutes. Her two minutes.\par \par \uc2 TRUMP\uc2 : I did not say that.\par \par \uc2 WALLACE: It's her two minutes.\par \par \uc2 CLINTON\uc2 : He went on to say, ''Look at her. I don't think so.'' About another woman, he said, ''That wouldn't be my first choice.'' He attacked the woman reporter writing the story, called her ''disgusting,'' as he has called a number of women during this campaign.\par \par \uc2 Donald thinks belittling women makes him bigger. He goes after their dignity, their self-worth, and I don't think there is a woman anywhere who doesn't know what that feels like. So we now know what Donald thinks and what he says and how he acts toward women. That's who Donald is.\par \par \uc2 I think it's really up to all of us to demonstrate who we are and who our country is, and to stand up and be very clear about what we expect from our next president, how we want to bring our country together, where we don't want to have the kind of pitting of people one against the other, where instead we celebrate our diversity, we lift people up, and we make our country even greater.\par \par \uc2 America is great, because America is good. And it really is up to all of us to make that true, now and in the future, and particularly for our children and our grandchildren.\par \par \uc2 WALLACE: Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 ...\par \par \uc2 TRUMP\uc2 : Nobody has more respect for women than I do. Nobody.\par \par \uc2 (LAUGHTER)\par \par \uc2 Nobody has more respect...\par \par \uc2 WALLACE: Please, everybody.\par \par \uc2 TRUMP\uc2 : And frankly, those stories have been largely debunked. And I really want to just talk about something slightly different.\par \par \uc2 She mentions this, which is all fiction, all fictionalized, probably or possibly started by her and her very sleazy campaign. But I will tell you what isn't fictionalized are her e-mails, where she destroyed 33,000 e-mails criminally, criminally, after getting a subpoena from the \uc2 United States Congress\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 What happened to the \uc2 FBI\uc2 , I don't know. We have a great general, four-star general, today you read it in all of the papers, going to potentially serve five years in jail for lying to the \uc2 FBI\uc2 . One lie. She's lied hundreds of times to the people, to Congress, and to the \uc2 FBI\uc2 . He's going to probably go to jail. This is a four-star general. And she gets away with it, and she can run for the presidency of the United States? That's really what you should be talking about, not fiction, where somebody wants fame or where they come out of her crooked campaign.\par \par \uc2 WALLACE: Secretary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 ?\par \par \uc2 CLINTON\uc2 : Well, every time Donald is pushed on something which is obviously uncomfortable, like what these women are saying, he immediately goes to denying responsibility. And it's not just about women. He never apologizes or says he's sorry for anything.\par \par \uc2 So we know what he has said and what he's done to women. But he also went after a disabled reporter, mocked and mimicked him on national television.\par \par \uc2 TRUMP\uc2 : Wrong.\par \par \uc2 CLINTON\uc2 : He went after Mr. and Mrs. Khan, the parents of a young man who died serving our country, a Gold Star family, because of their religion. He went after \uc2 John McCain\uc2 , a prisoner of war, said he prefers ''people who aren't captured.'' He went after a federal judge, born in Indiana, but who Donald said couldn't be trusted to try the fraud and racketeering case against \uc2 Trump\uc2  University because his parents were Mexican.\par \par \uc2 So it's not one thing. This is a pattern, a pattern of divisiveness, of a very dark and in many ways dangerous vision of our country, where he incites violence, where he applauds people who are pushing and pulling and punching at his rallies. That is not who America is.\par \par \uc2 And I hope that as we move in the last weeks of this campaign, more and more people will understand what's at stake in this \uc2 election\uc2 . It really does come down to what kind of country we are going to have.\par \par \uc2 TRUMP\uc2 : So sad when she talks about violence at my rallies, and she caused the violence. It's on tape.\par \par \uc2 WALLACE: During the last...\par \par \uc2 TRUMP\uc2 : The other things are false, but honestly, I'd love to talk about getting rid of ISIS, and I'd love to talk about other things...\par \par \uc2 WALLACE: OK.\par \par \uc2 TRUMP\uc2 : ... but those other charges, as she knows, are false.\par \par \uc2 WALLACE: In this bucket about fitness to be president, there's been a lot of developments over the last 10 days since the last debate. I'd like to ask you about them. These are questions that the American people have.\par \par \uc2 Secretary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , during your 2009 Senate confirmation hearing, you promised to avoid even the appearance of a conflict of interest with your dealing with the \uc2 Clinton\uc2  Foundation\uc2  while you were secretary of state, but e-mails show that donors got special access to you. Those seeking grants for Haiti relief were considered separately from non-donors, and some of those donors got contracts, government contracts, taxpayer money.\par \par \uc2 Can you really say that you kept your pledge to that Senate committee? And why isn't what happened and what went on between you and the \uc2 Clinton\uc2  Foundation\uc2 , why isn't it what Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  calls pay to play?\par \par \uc2 CLINTON\uc2 : Well, everything I did as secretary of state was in furtherance of our country's interests and our values. The State Department has said that. I think that's been proven.\par \par \uc2 But I am happy, in fact I'm thrilled to talk about the \uc2 Clinton\uc2  Foundation\uc2 , because it is a world-renowned charity and I am so proud of the work that it does. You know, I could talk for the rest of the debate -- I know I don't have the time to do that.\par \par \uc2 But just briefly, the \uc2 Clinton\uc2  Foundation\uc2  made it possible for 11 million people around the world with HIV-AIDS to afford treatment, and that's about half all the people in the world who are getting treatment. In partnership with the American Health Association...\par \par \uc2 WALLACE: Secretary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 ...\par \par \uc2 CLINTON\uc2 : ... we have made environments in schools healthier for kids, including healthier lunches...\par \par \uc2 WALLACE: Secretary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , respectfully, this is -- this is an open discussion.\par \par \uc2 CLINTON\uc2 : Well, it is an open discussion. And you...\par \par \uc2 WALLACE: And the specific question went to pay for play. Do you want to talk about that?\par \par \uc2 CLINTON\uc2 : Well, but there is no -- but there is no evidence -- but there is...\par \par \uc2 (CROSSTALK)\par \par \uc2 TRUMP\uc2 : I think that it's been very well...\par \par \uc2 WALLACE: Let's ask Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 CLINTON\uc2 : There is a lot of evidence about the very good work...\par \par \uc2 TRUMP\uc2 : It's been very well studied.\par \par \uc2 CLINTON\uc2 : ... and the high rankings...\par \par \uc2 (CROSSTALK)\par \par \uc2 WALLACE: Please let me Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  speak.\par \par \uc2 TRUMP\uc2 : ... and it's a criminal enterprise, and so many people know it.\par \par \uc2 WALLACE: Please let Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  speak.\par \par \uc2 (CROSSTALK)\par \par \uc2 TRUMP\uc2 : It's a criminal enterprise. Saudi Arabia giving $25 million, Qatar, all of these countries. You talk about women and women's rights? So these are people that push gays off business -- off buildings. These are people that kill women and treat women horribly. And yet you take their money.\par \par \uc2 So I'd like to ask you right now, why don't you give back the money that you've taken from certain countries that treat certain groups of people so horribly? Why don't you give back the money? I think it would be a great gesture.\par \par \uc2 Because she takes a tremendous amount of money. And you take a look at the people of Haiti. I was at a little Haiti the other day in Florida. And I want to tell you, they hate the Clintons, because what's happened in Haiti with the \uc2 Clinton\uc2  Foundation\uc2  is a disgrace. And you know it, and they know it, and everybody knows it.\par \par \uc2 WALLACE: Secretary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 ?\par \par \uc2 CLINTON\uc2 : Well, very quickly, we at the \uc2 Clinton\uc2  Foundation\uc2  spend 90 percent -- 90 percent of all the money that is donated on behalf of programs of people around the world and in our own country. I'm very proud of that. We have the highest rating from the watchdogs that follow foundations. And I'd be happy to compare what we do with the \uc2 Trump\uc2  Foundation, which took money from other people and bought a six- foot portrait of Donald. I mean, who does that? It just was astonishing.\par \par \uc2 But when it comes to Haiti, Haiti is the poorest country in our hemisphere. The earthquake and the hurricanes, it has devastated Haiti. Bill and I have been involved in trying to help Haiti for many years. The \uc2 Clinton\uc2  Foundation\uc2  raised $30 million to help Haiti after the catastrophic earthquake and all of the terrible problems the people there had.\par \par \uc2 We have done things to help small businesses, agriculture, and so much else. And we're going to keep working to help Haiti...\par \par \uc2 WALLACE: All right.\par \par \uc2 CLINTON\uc2 : ... because it's an important part of the American experience.\par \par \uc2 TRUMP\uc2 : They don't want you to help them anymore.\par \par \uc2 (CROSSTALK)\par \par \uc2 TRUMP\uc2 : I'd like to mention one thing. \uc2 Trump\uc2  Foundation, small foundation. People contribute, I contribute. The money goes 100 percent -- 100 percent goes to different charities, including a lot of military. I don't get anything. I don't buy boats. I don't buy planes. What happens -- the money goes to them.\par \par \uc2 WALLACE: Wasn't some of the money used to settle your lawsuits, sir?\par \par \uc2 TRUMP\uc2 : No, it was -- we put up the American flag. And that's it. They put up the American flag. We fought for the right in Palm Beach to put up the American flag.\par \par \uc2 WALLACE: Right. But there was a penalty that was imposed by Palm Beach County, and the money came from your foundation...\par \par \uc2 TRUMP\uc2 : There was. There was. And, by the way...\par \par \uc2 WALLACE: ... instead of Mar-a-Lago or yourself, sir.\par \par \uc2 TRUMP\uc2 : ... the money -- the money went to Fisher House, where they build houses -- the money that you're talking about went to Fisher House, where they build houses for veterans and disabled vets.\par \par \uc2 WALLACE: I want to get into one...\par \par \uc2 CLINTON\uc2 : But, of course, there's no way we can know whether any of that is true, because he hasn't released his tax returns. He is the first candidate ever to run for president in the last 40-plus years who has not released his tax returns, so everything he says about charity or anything else, we can't prove it. You can look at our tax returns. We've got them all out there.\par \par \uc2 But what is really troubling is that we learned in the last debate he has not paid a penny in federal income tax. And we were talking about immigrants a few minutes ago, Chris. You know, half of all immigrants -- undocumented immigrants in our country -- actually pay federal income tax. So we have undocumented immigrants in America who are paying more federal income tax than a billionaire. I find that just astonishing.\par \par \uc2 WALLACE: I want...\par \par \uc2 TRUMP\uc2 : So let me just tell you very quickly, we're entitled because of the laws that people like her passed to take massive amounts of depreciation on other charges, and we do it. And all of her donors -- just about all of them -- I know Buffett took hundreds of millions of dollars, Soros, \uc2 George Soros\uc2 , took hundreds of millions of dollars...\par \par \uc2 WALLACE: We...\par \par \uc2 TRUMP\uc2 : Let me just explain.\par \par \uc2 WALLACE: But, no, we heard this...\par \par \uc2 TRUMP\uc2 : Most of her donors have done the same thing as I do.\par \par \uc2 WALLACE: Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , we -- OK.\par \par \uc2 TRUMP\uc2 : You know what she should have done?\par \par \uc2 WALLACE: Folks, we heard this...\par \par \uc2 TRUMP\uc2 : And you know, Hillary, what you should have done, you should have changed the law when you were a United States senator...\par \par \uc2 WALLACE: Folks, we heard this...\par \par \uc2 TRUMP\uc2 : ... because your donors and your special interests are doing the same thing as I do, except even more so.\par \par \uc2 CLINTON\uc2 : Well, you know...\par \par \uc2 TRUMP\uc2 : You should have changed the law. But you won't change the law, because you take in so much money. I mean, I sat in my apartment today on a very beautiful hotel down the street known as \uc2 Trump\uc2 ...\par \par \uc2 CLINTON\uc2 : Made with Chinese steel.\par \par \uc2 TRUMP\uc2 : But I will tell you, I sat there...\par \par \uc2 (LAUGHTER)\par \par \uc2 ... I sat there watching ad after ad after ad, false ad. All paid for by your friends on Wall Street that gave so much money because they know you're going to protect them. And, frankly, you should have changed the laws.\par \par \uc2 WALLACE: Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 ...\par \par \uc2 TRUMP\uc2 : If you don't like what I did, you should have changed the laws.\par \par \uc2 WALLACE: Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , I want to ask you about one last question in this topic. You have been warning at rallies recently that this \uc2 election\uc2  is rigged and that \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  is in the process of trying to steal it from you.\par \par \uc2 Your running mate, Governor Pence, pledged on Sunday that he and you -- his words -- ''will absolutely accept the result of this \uc2 election\uc2 .'' Today your daughter, Ivanka, said the same thing. I want to ask you here on the stage tonight: Do you make the same commitment that you will absolutely -- sir, that you will absolutely accept the result of this \uc2 election\uc2 ?\par \par \uc2 TRUMP\uc2 : I will look at it at the time. I'm not looking at anything now. I'll look at it at the time.\par \par \uc2 What I've seen -- what I've seen is so bad. First of all, the media is so dishonest and so corrupt, and the pile-on is so amazing. The \uc2 New York Times\uc2  actually wrote an article about it, but they don't even care. It's so dishonest. And they've poisoned the mind of the voters.\par \par \uc2 But unfortunately for them, I think the voters are seeing through it. I think they're going to see through it. We'll find out on November 8th. But I think they're going to see through it.\par \par \uc2 WALLACE: But, sir, there's...\par \par \uc2 TRUMP\uc2 : If you look -- excuse me, Chris -- if you look at your voter rolls, you will see millions of people that are registered to vote -- millions, this isn't coming from me -- this is coming from Pew Report and other places -- millions of people that are registered to vote that shouldn't be registered to vote.\par \par \uc2 So let me just give you one other thing. So I talk about the corrupt media. I talk about the millions of people -- tell you one other thing. She shouldn't be allowed to run. It's crooked -- she's -- she's guilty of a very, very serious crime. She should not be allowed to run.\par \par \uc2 And just in that respect, I say it's rigged, because she should never...\par \par \uc2 WALLACE: But...\par \par \uc2 TRUMP\uc2 : Chris, she should never have been allowed to run for the presidency based on what she did with e-mails and so many other things.\par \par \uc2 WALLACE: But, sir, there is a tradition in this country -- in fact, one of the prides of this country -- is the peaceful transition of power and that no matter how hard-fought a campaign is, that at the end of the campaign that the loser concedes to the winner. Not saying that you're necessarily going to be the loser or the winner, but that the loser concedes to the winner and that the country comes together in part for the good of the country. Are you saying you're not prepared now to commit to that principle?\par \par \uc2 TRUMP\uc2 : What I'm saying is that I will tell you at the time. I'll keep you in suspense. OK?\par \par \uc2 CLINTON\uc2 : Well, Chris, let me respond to that, because that's horrifying. You know, every time Donald thinks things are not going in his direction, he claims whatever it is, is rigged against him.\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 FBI\uc2  conducted a year-long investigation into my e-mails. They concluded there was no case; he said the \uc2 FBI\uc2  was rigged. He lost the Iowa caucus. He lost the Wisconsin primary. He said the Republican primary was rigged against him. Then \uc2 Trump\uc2  University gets sued for fraud and racketeering; he claims the court system and the federal judge is rigged against him. There was even a time when he didn't get an Emmy for his TV program three years in a row and he started tweeting that the Emmys were rigged against him.\par \par \uc2 TRUMP\uc2 : Should have gotten it.\par \par \uc2 (LAUGHTER)\par \par \uc2 CLINTON\uc2 : This is -- this is a mindset. This is how Donald thinks. And it's funny, but it's also really troubling.\par \par \uc2 WALLACE: OK.\par \par \uc2 CLINTON\uc2 : So that is not the way our democracy works. We've been around for 240 years. We've had free and fair elections. We've accepted the outcomes when we may not have liked them. And that is what must be expected of anyone standing on a debate stage during a general \uc2 election\uc2 . You know, President Obama said the other day when you're whining before the game is even finished...\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 WALLACE: Hold on. Hold on, folks. Hold on, folks.\par \par \uc2 CLINTON\uc2 : ... it just shows you're not up to doing the job. And let's -- you know, let's be clear about what he is saying and what that means. He is denigrating -- he's talking down our democracy. And I, for one, am appalled that somebody who is the nominee of one of our two major parties would take that kind of position.\par \par \uc2 TRUMP\uc2 : I think what the \uc2 FBI\uc2  did and what the Department of Justice did, including meeting with her husband, the attorney general, in the back of an airplane on the tarmac in Arizona, I think it's disgraceful. I think it's a disgrace.\par \par \uc2 WALLACE: All right.\par \par \uc2 TRUMP\uc2 : I think we've never had a situation so bad in this country.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 WALLACE: Hold on, folks. This doesn't do any good for anyone. Let's please continue the debate, and let's move on to the subject of foreign hot spots.\par \par \uc2 The Iraqi offensive to take back Mosul has begun. If they are successful in pushing ISIS out of that city and out of all of Iraq, the question then becomes, what happens the day after? And that's something that whichever of you ends up -- whoever of you ends up as president is going to have to confront.\par \par \uc2 Will you put U.S. troops into that vacuum to make sure that ISIS doesn't come back or isn't replaced by something even worse? Secretary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , you go first in this segment. You have two minutes.\par \par \uc2 CLINTON\uc2 : Well, I am encouraged that there is an effort led by the Iraqi army, supported by Kurdish forces, and also given the help and advice from the number of special forces and other Americans on the ground. But I will not support putting American soldiers into Iraq as an occupying force. I don't think that is in our interest, and I don't think that would be smart to do. In fact, Chris, I think that would be a big red flag waving for ISIS to reconstitute itself.\par \par \uc2 The goal here is to take back Mosul. It's going to be a hard fight. I've got no illusions about that. And then continue to press into Syria to begin to take back and move on Raqqa, which is the ISIS headquarters.\par \par \uc2 I am hopeful that the hard work that American military advisers have done will pay off and that we will see a real -- a really successful military operation. But we know we've got lots of work to do. Syria will remain a hotbed of terrorism as long as the civil war, aided and abetted by the Iranians and the Russians, continue.\par \par \uc2 So I have said, look, we need to keep our eye on ISIS. That's why I want to have an intelligence surge that protects us here at home, why we have to go after them from the air, on the ground, online, why we have to make sure here at home we don't let terrorists buy weapons. If you're too dangerous to fly, you're too dangerous to buy a gun.\par \par \uc2 And I'm going to continue to push for a no-fly zone and safe havens within Syria not only to help protect the Syrians and prevent the constant outflow of refugees, but to, frankly, gain some leverage on both the Syrian government and the Russians so that perhaps we can have the kind of serious negotiation necessary to bring the conflict to an end and go forward on a political track.\par \par \uc2 WALLACE: Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , same question. If we are able to push ISIS out of Mosul and out of Iraq, will -- would you be willing to put U.S. troops in there to prevent their return or something else?\par \par \uc2 TRUMP\uc2 : Let me tell you, Mosul is so sad. We had Mosul. But when she left, when she took everybody out, we lost Mosul. Now we're fighting again to get Mosul. The problem with Mosul and what they wanted to do is they wanted to get the leaders of ISIS who they felt were in Mosul.\par \par \uc2 About three months ago, I started reading that they want to get the leaders and they're going to attack Mosul. Whatever happened to the element of surprise, OK? We announce we're going after Mosul. I have been reading about going after Mosul now for about -- how long is it, Hillary, three months? These people have all left. They've all left.\par \par \uc2 The element of surprise. Douglas MacArthur, George Patton spinning in their graves when they see the stupidity of our country. So we're now fighting for Mosul, that we had. All she had to do was stay there, and now we're going in to get it.\par \par \uc2 But you know who the big winner in Mosul is going to be after we eventually get it? And the only reason they did it is because she's running for the office of president and they want to look tough. They want to look good. He violated the red line in the sand, and he made so many mistakes, made all the mistakes. That's why we have the great migration. But she wanted to look good for the \uc2 election\uc2 . So they're going in.\par \par \uc2 But who's going to get Mosul, really? We'll take Mosul eventually. But the way -- if you look at what's happening, much tougher than they thought. Much, much tougher. Much more dangerous. Going to be more deaths that they thought.\par \par \uc2 But the leaders that we wanted to get are all gone because they're smart. They say, what do we need this for? So Mosul is going to be a wonderful thing. And Iran should write us a letter of thank you, just like the really stupid -- the stupidest deal of all time, a deal that's going to give Iran absolutely nuclear weapons. Iran should write us yet another letter saying thank you very much, because Iran, as I said many years ago, Iran is taking over Iraq, something they've wanted to do forever, but we've made it so easy for them.\par \par \uc2 So we're now going to take Mosul. And do you know who's going to be the beneficiary? Iran. Oh, yeah, they're making -- I mean, they are outsmarting -- look, you're not there, you might be involved in that decision. But you were there when you took everybody out of Mosul and out of Iraq. You shouldn't have been in Iraq, but you did vote for it. You shouldn't have been in Iraq, but once you were in Iraq, you should have never left the way.\par \par \uc2 WALLACE: Sir, your two minutes are up.\par \par \uc2 TRUMP\uc2 : The point is, the big winner is going to be Iran.\par \par \uc2 CLINTON\uc2 : Well, you know, once again, Donald is implying that he didn't support the invasion of Iraq. I said it was a mistake. I've said that years ago. He has consistently denied what is...\par \par \uc2 TRUMP\uc2 : Wrong.\par \par \uc2 CLINTON\uc2 : ... a very clear fact that...\par \par \uc2 TRUMP\uc2 : Wrong.\par \par \uc2 CLINTON\uc2 : ... before the invasion, he supported it. And, you know, I just want everybody to go \uc2 Google\uc2  it. \uc2 Google\uc2  ''\uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  Iraq.'' And you will see the dozens of sources which verify that he was for the invasion of Iraq.\par \par \uc2 TRUMP\uc2 : Wrong.\par \par \uc2 CLINTON\uc2 : And you can actually hear the audio of him saying that. Now, why does that matter? Well, it matters because he has not told the truth about that position. I guess he believes it makes him look better now to contrast with me because I did vote for it.\par \par \uc2 But what's really important here is to understand all the interplay. Mosul is a Sunni city. Mosul is on the border of Syria. And, yes, we do need to go after Baghdadi, and -- just like we went after bin Laden, while you were doing ''Celebrity Apprentice,'' and we brought him to justice. We need to go after the leadership.\par \par \uc2 But we need to get rid of them, get rid of their fighters. There are an estimated several thousand fighters in Mosul. They've been digging underground. They've been prepared to defend. It's going to be tough fighting. But I think we can take back Mosul, and then we can move on into Syria and take back Raqqa.\par \par \uc2 This is what we have to do. I'm just amazed that he seems to think that the Iraqi government and our allies and everybody else launched the attack on Mosul to help me in this \uc2 election\uc2 , but that's how Donald thinks. You know, he always is looking for some conspiracy.\par \par \uc2 TRUMP\uc2 : Chris, we don't gain anything.\par \par \uc2 CLINTON\uc2 : He has all the conspiracy theories...\par \par \uc2 (CROSSTALK)\par \par \uc2 TRUMP\uc2 : Iran is taking over Iraq.\par \par \uc2 WALLACE: Secretary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , it's...\par \par \uc2 (CROSSTALK)\par \par \uc2 TRUMP\uc2 : Iran is taking over Iraq. We don't gain anything.\par \par \uc2 CLINTON\uc2 : This conspiracy theory, which he's been spewing out for quite some time.\par \par \uc2 TRUMP\uc2 : If they did it by surprise...\par \par \uc2 (CROSSTALK)\par \par \uc2 WALLACE: Wait, wait, wait, Secretary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , it's an open discussion.\par \par \uc2 CLINTON\uc2 : He says...\par \par \uc2 (CROSSTALK)\par \par \uc2 TRUMP\uc2 : We could have gained if they did it by surprise.\par \par \uc2 WALLACE: Secretary, please let Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  speak.\par \par \uc2 CLINTON\uc2 : ... unfit, and he proves it every time he talks.\par \par \uc2 TRUMP\uc2 : No, you are the one that's unfit. You know, \uc2 WikiLeaks\uc2  just actually came out -- \uc2 John Podesta\uc2  said some horrible things about you, and, boy, was he right. He said some beauties. And you know, Bernie Sanders, he said you have bad judgment. You do.\par \par \uc2 And if you think that going into Mosul after we let the world know we're going in, and all of the people that we really wanted -- the leaders -- they're all gone. If you think that was good, then you do. Now, \uc2 John Podesta\uc2  said you have terrible instincts. Bernie Sanders said you have bad judgment. I agree with both.\par \par \uc2 CLINTON\uc2 : Well, you should ask Bernie Sanders who he's supporting for president. And he has said...\par \par \uc2 TRUMP\uc2 : Which is a big mistake.\par \par \uc2 CLINTON\uc2 : ... as he has campaigned for me around the country, you are the most dangerous person to run for president in the modern history of America. I think he's right.\par \par \uc2 WALLACE: Let's turn to Aleppo. Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , in the last debate, you were both asked about the situation in the Syrian city of Aleppo. And I want to follow up on that, because you said several things in that debate which were not true, sir. You said that Aleppo has basically fallen. In fact, there -- in fact, there are... \uc2 TRUMP\uc2 : It's a catastrophe. I mean...\par \par \uc2 WALLACE: It's a catastrophe, but there...\par \par \uc2 TRUMP\uc2 : ... it's a mess.\par \par \uc2 WALLACE: There are a quarter of...\par \par \uc2 TRUMP\uc2 : Have you seen it? Have you seen it?\par \par \uc2 WALLACE: Sir...\par \par \uc2 TRUMP\uc2 : Have you seen what's happening to Aleppo?\par \par \uc2 WALLACE: Sir, if I may finish my question...\par \par \uc2 TRUMP\uc2 : OK, so it hasn't fallen. Take a look at it.\par \par \uc2 WALLACE: Well, there are a quarter of a million people still living there and being slaughtered.\par \par \uc2 TRUMP\uc2 : That's right. And they are being slaughtered...\par \par \uc2 WALLACE: Yes.\par \par \uc2 TRUMP\uc2 : ... because of bad decisions.\par \par \uc2 WALLACE: If I may just finish here, and you also said that -- that Syria and Russia are busy fighting ISIS. In fact, they have been the ones who've been bombing and shelling eastern Aleppo, and they just announced a humanitarian pause, in effect, admitting that they have been bombing and shelling Aleppo. Would you like to clear that up, sir?\par \par \uc2 TRUMP\uc2 : Well, Aleppo is a disaster. It's a humanitarian nightmare. But it has fallen from the -- from any standpoint. I mean, what do you need, a signed document? Take a look at Aleppo. It is so sad when you see what's happened.\par \par \uc2 And a lot of this is because of \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , because what's happened is, by fighting Assad, who turned out to be a lot tougher than she thought, and now she's going to say, oh, he loves Assad, she's -- he's just much tougher and much smarter than her and Obama. And everyone thought he was gone two years ago, three years ago. He -- he aligned with Russia.\par \par \uc2 He now also aligned with Iran, who we made very powerful. We gave them $150 billion back. We give them $1.7 billion in cash. I mean, cash. Bundles of cash as big as this stage. We gave them $1.7 billion.\par \par \uc2 Now they have -- he has aligned with Russia and with Iran. They don't want ISIS, but they have other things, because we're backing -- we're backing rebels. We don't know who the rebels are. We're giving them lots of money, lots of everything. We don't know who the rebels are. And when and if -- and it's not going to happen, because you have Russia and you have Iran now. But if they ever did overthrow Assad, you might end up with -- as bad as Assad is, and he's a bad guy, but you may very well end up with worse than Assad.\par \par \uc2 If she did nothing, we'd be in much better shape. And this is what's caused the great migration, where she's taking in tens of thousands of Syrian refugees, who probably in many cases -- not probably, who are definitely...\par \par \uc2 WALLACE: Let me...\par \par \uc2 TRUMP\uc2 : ... in many cases, ISIS-aligned, and we now have them in our country, and wait until you see -- this is going to be the great Trojan horse. And wait until you see what happens in the coming years. Lots of luck, Hillary. Thanks a lot for doing a great job.\par \par \uc2 WALLACE: Secretary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , you have talked about -- and in the last debate and again today -- that you would impose a no-fly zone to try to protect the people of Aleppo and to stop the killing there. President Obama has refused to do that because he fears it's going to draw us closer or deeper into the conflict.\par \par \uc2 And General Joseph Dunford, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, says you impose a no-fly zone, chances are you're going to get into a war -- his words -- with Syria and Russia. So the question I have is, if you impose a no-fly zone -- first of all, how do you respond to their concerns? Secondly, if you impose a no-fly zone and a Russian plane violates that, does President \uc2 Clinton\uc2  shoot that plane down?\par \par \uc2 CLINTON\uc2 : Well, Chris, first of all, I think a no-fly zone could save lives and could hasten the end of the conflict. I'm well aware of the really legitimate concerns that you have expressed from both the president and the general.\par \par \uc2 This would not be done just on the first day. This would take a lot of negotiation. And it would also take making it clear to the Russians and the Syrians that our purpose here was to provide safe zones on the ground.\par \par \uc2 We've had millions of people leave Syria and those millions of people inside Syria who have been dislocated. So I think we could strike a deal and make it very clear to the Russians and the Syrians that this was something that we believe was in the best interests of the people on the ground in Syria, it would help us with our fight against ISIS.\par \par \uc2 But I want to respond to what Donald said about refugees. He's made these claims repeatedly. I am not going to let anyone into this country who is not vetted, who we do not have confidence in. But I am not going to slam the door on women and children. That picture of that little 4-year-old boy in Aleppo, with the blood coming down his face while he sat in an ambulance, is haunting. And so we are going to do very careful, thorough vetting. That does not solve our internal challenges with ISIS and our need to stop radicalization, to work with American Muslim communities who are on the front lines to identify and prevent attacks. In fact, the killer of the dozens of people at the nightclub in Orlando, the Pulse nightclub, was born in Queens, the same place Donald was born. So let's be clear about what the threat is and how we are best going to be able to meet it.\par \par \uc2 And, yes, some of that threat emanates from over in Syria and Iraq, and we've got to keep fighting, and I will defeat ISIS, and some of it is we have to up our game and be much smarter here at home.\par \par \uc2 WALLACE: Folks, I want to get into our final segment.\par \par \uc2 TRUMP\uc2 : But I just have to...\par \par \uc2 WALLACE: Real quick.\par \par \uc2 TRUMP\uc2 : It's so ridiculous what she -- she will defeat ISIS. We should have never let ISIS happen in the first place. And right now, they're in 32 countries.\par \par \uc2 WALLACE: OK.\par \par \uc2 TRUMP\uc2 : We should have -- wait one second. They had a cease-fire three weeks ago. A cease-fire, the United States, Russia, and Syria. And during the cease-fire, Russia took over vast swatches of land, and then they said we don't want the cease-fire anymore.\par \par \uc2 We are so outplayed on missiles, on cease-fires. They are outplayed. Now, she wasn't there. I assume she had nothing to do with it. But our country is so outplayed by Putin and Assad, and by the way -- and by Iran. Nobody can believe how stupid our leadership is.\par \par \uc2 WALLACE: Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , Secretary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  -- no, we need to move on to our final segment, and that is the national debt, which has not been discussed until tonight.\par \par \uc2 Our national debt, as a share of the economy, our GDP, is now 77 percent. That's the highest since just after World War II. But the nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget says, Secretary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , under your plan, debt would rise to 86 percent of GDP over the next 10 years. Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , under your plan, they say it would rise to 105 percent of GDP over the next 10 years. The question is, why are both of you ignoring this problem? Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , you go first.\par \par \uc2 TRUMP\uc2 : Well, I say they're wrong, because I'm going to create tremendous jobs. And we're bringing GDP from, really, 1 percent, which is what it is now, and if she got in, it will be less than zero. But we're bringing it from 1 percent up to 4 percent. And I actually think we can go higher than 4 percent. I think you can go to 5 percent or 6 percent. And if we do, you don't have to bother asking your question, because we have a tremendous machine. We will have created a tremendous economic machine once again. To do that, we're taking back jobs. We're not going to let our companies be raided by other countries where we lose all our jobs, we don't make our product anymore. It's very sad. But I'm going to create a -- the kind of a country that we were from the standpoint of industry. We used to be there. We've given it up. We've become very, very sloppy.\par \par \uc2 We've had people that are political hacks making the biggest deals in the world, bigger than companies. You take these big companies, these trade deals are far bigger than these companies, and yet we don't use our great leaders, many of whom back me and many of whom back Hillary, I must say. But we don't use those people. Those are the people -- these are the greatest negotiators in the world. We have the greatest businesspeople in the world. We have to use them to negotiate our trade deals.\par \par \uc2 We use political hacks. We use people that get the position because they gave -- they made a campaign contribution and they're dealing with China and people that are very much smarter than they are. So we have to use our great people.\par \par \uc2 But that being said, we will create an economic machine the likes of which we haven't seen in many decades. And people, Chris, will again go back to work and they'll make a lot of money. And we'll have companies that will grow and expand and start from new.\par \par \uc2 WALLACE: Secretary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 ?\par \par \uc2 CLINTON\uc2 : Well, first, when I hear Donald talk like that and know that his slogan is ''Make America Great Again,'' I wonder when he thought America was great. And before he rushes and says, ''You know, before you and President Obama were there,'' I think it's important to recognize that he has been criticizing our government for decades.\par \par \uc2 You know, back in 1987, he took out a $100,000 ad in the \uc2 New York Times\uc2 , during the time when President Reagan was president, and basically said exactly what he just said now, that we were the laughingstock of the world. He was criticizing President Reagan. This is the way Donald thinks about himself, puts himself into, you know, the middle and says, ''You know, I alone can fix it,'' as he said on the convention stage.\par \par \uc2 But if you look at the debt, which is the issue you asked about, Chris, I pay for everything I'm proposing. I do not add a penny to the national debt. I take that very seriously, because I do think it's one of the issues we've got to come to grips with.\par \par \uc2 So when I talk about how we're going to pay for education, how we're going to invest in infrastructure, how we're going to get the cost of prescription drugs down, and a lot of the other issues that people talk to me about all the time, I've made it very clear we are going where the money is. We are going to ask the wealthy and corporations to pay their fair share.\par \par \uc2 And there is no evidence whatsoever that that will slow down or diminish our growth. In fact, I think just the opposite. We'll have what economists call middle-out growth. We've got to get back to rebuilding the middle class, the families of America. That's where growth will come from. That's why I want to invest in you. I want to invest in your family.\par \par \uc2 And I think that's the smartest way to grow the economy, to make the economy fairer. And we just have a big disagreement about this. It may be because of our experiences. You know, he started off with his dad as a millionaire...\par \par \uc2 TRUMP\uc2 : Yeah, yeah, we've heard -- we've heard this before, Hillary.\par \par \uc2 CLINTON\uc2 : I started off with -- my dad was a small-business man.\par \par \uc2 TRUMP\uc2 : We've heard this before.\par \par \uc2 CLINTON\uc2 : And I think it -- you know, it's a difference that affects how we see the world and what we want to do with the economy.\par \par \uc2 WALLACE: Time.\par \par \uc2 TRUMP\uc2 : Thank you, Hillary. Could I just respond?\par \par \uc2 WALLACE: Well, no, sir, because we're running out of time...\par \par \uc2 TRUMP\uc2 : Because I did disagree with Ronald Reagan very strongly on trade. I disagreed with him. We should have been much tougher on trade even then. I've been waiting for years. Nobody does it right.\par \par \uc2 WALLACE: OK.\par \par \uc2 TRUMP\uc2 : And frankly, now we're going to do it right.\par \par \uc2 WALLACE: All right. The one last area I want to get into with you in this debate is the fact that the biggest driver of our debt is entitlements, which is 60 percent of all federal spending. Now, the Committee for federal -- a Responsible Federal Budget has looked at both of your plans and they say neither of you has a serious plan that is going to solve the fact that Medicare's going to run out of money in the 2020s, Social Security is going to run out of money in the 2030s, and at that time, recipients are going to take huge cuts in their benefits.\par \par \uc2 So, in effect, the final question I want to ask you in this regard is -- and let me start with you, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , would President \uc2 Trump\uc2  make a deal to save Medicare and Social Security that included both tax increases and benefit cuts, in effect, a grand bargain on entitlements?\par \par \uc2 TRUMP\uc2 : I'm cutting taxes. We're going to grow the economy. It's going to grow at a record rate of growth.\par \par \uc2 WALLACE: That's not going to help in the entitlements.\par \par \uc2 TRUMP\uc2 : No, it's going to totally help you. And one thing we have to do: Repeal and replace the disaster known as Obamacare. It's destroying our country. It's destroying our businesses, our small business and our big businesses. We have to repeal and replace Obamacare.\par \par \uc2 You take a look at the kind of numbers that that will cost us in the year '17, it is a disaster. If we don't repeal and replace -- now, it's probably going to die of its own weight. But Obamacare has to go. It's -- the premiums are going up 60 percent, 70 percent, 80 percent. Next year they're going to go up over 100 percent.\par \par \uc2 And I'm really glad that the premiums have started -- at least the people see what's happening, because she wants to keep Obamacare and she wants to make it even worse, and it can't get any worse. Bad health care at the most expensive price. We have to repeal and replace Obamacare.\par \par \uc2 WALLACE: And, Secretary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , same question, because at this point, Social Security and Medicare are going to run out, the trust funds are going to run out of money. Will you as president entertain -- will you consider a grand bargain, a deal that includes both tax increases and benefit cuts to try to save both programs?\par \par \uc2 CLINTON\uc2 : Well, Chris, I am on record as saying that we need to put more money into the Social Security Trust Fund. That's part of my commitment to raise taxes on the wealthy. My Social Security payroll contribution will go up, as will Donald's, assuming he can't figure out how to get out of it. But what we want to do is to replenish the Social Security Trust Fund...\par \par \uc2 TRUMP\uc2 : Such a nasty woman.\par \par \uc2 CLINTON\uc2 : ... by making sure that we have sufficient resources, and that will come from either raising the cap and/or finding other ways to get more money into it. I will not cut benefits. I want to enhance benefits for low-income workers and for women who have been disadvantaged by the current Social Security system.\par \par \uc2 But what Donald is proposing with these massive tax cuts will result in a $20 trillion additional national debt. That will have dire consequences for Social Security and Medicare.\par \par \uc2 And I'll say something about the Affordable Care Act, which he wants to repeal. The Affordable Care Act extended the solvency of the Medicare Trust Fund. So if repeals it, our Medicare problem gets worse. What we need to do is go after...\par \par \uc2 TRUMP\uc2 : Your husband disagrees with you.\par \par \uc2 CLINTON\uc2 : ... the long-term health care drivers. We've got to get costs down, increase value, emphasize wellness. I have a plan for doing that. And I think that we will be able to get entitlement spending under control by with more resources and harder decisions.\par \par \uc2 WALLACE: This is -- this is the final time, probably to both of your delight, that you're going to be on a stage together in this campaign. I would like to end it on a positive note. You had not agreed to closing statements, but it seems to me in a funny way that might make it more interesting because you haven't prepared closing statements.\par \par \uc2 So I'd like you each to take -- and we're going to put a clock up, a minute, as the final question in the final debate, to tell the American people why they should elect you to be the next president. This is another new mini-segment. Secretary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , it's your turn to go first.\par \par \uc2 CLINTON\uc2 : Well, I would like to say to everyone watching tonight that I'm reaching out to all Americans -- Democrats, Republicans, and independents -- because we need everybody to help make our country what it should be, to grow the economy, to make it fairer, to make it work for everyone. We need your talents, your skills, your commitments, your energy, your ambition.\par \par \uc2 You know, I've been privileged to see the presidency up close. And I know the awesome responsibility of protecting our country and the incredible opportunity of working to try to make life better for all of you. I have made the cause of children and families really my life's work.\par \par \uc2 That's what my mission will be in the presidency. I will stand up for families against powerful interests, against corporations. I will do everything that I can to make sure that you have good jobs, with rising incomes, that your kids have good educations from preschool through college. I hope you will give me a chance to serve as your president.\par \par \uc2 WALLACE: Secretary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , thank you.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 ?\par \par \uc2 TRUMP\uc2 : She's raising the money from the people she wants to control. Doesn't work that way.\par \par \uc2 But when I started this campaign, I started it very strongly. It's called ''Make America Great Again.'' We're going to make America great. We have a depleted military. It has to be helped, has to be fixed. We have the greatest people on Earth in our military. We don't take care of our veterans. We take care of illegal immigrants, people that come into the country illegally, better than we take care of our vets. That can't happen.\par \par \uc2 Our policemen and women are disrespected. We need law and order, but we need justice, too. Our inner cities are a disaster. You get shot walking to the store. They have no education. They have no jobs. I will do more for African-Americans and Latinos than she can ever do in 10 lifetimes.\par \par \uc2 All she's done is talk to the African-Americans and to the Latinos, but they get the vote, and then they come back, they say, we'll see you in four years. We are going to make America strong again, and we are going to make America great again, and it has to start now. We cannot take four more years of \uc2 Barack Obama\uc2 , and that's what you get when you get her.\par \par \uc2 WALLACE: Thank you both.\par \par \uc2 (APPLAUSE)\par \par \uc2 Secretary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  -- hold on just a moment, folks. Secretary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , I want to thank you both for participating in all three of these debates.\par \par \uc2 That brings to an end this year's debates sponsored by the \uc2 Commission on Presidential Debates\uc2 . We want to thank the \uc2 University of Nevada, Las Vegas\uc2 , and its students for having us. Now the decision is up to you.\par \par \uc2 While millions have already voted, \uc2 Election\uc2  Day, November 8th, is just 20 days away. One thing everyone here can agree on: We hope you will go vote. It is one of the honors and obligations of living in this great country. Thank you, and good night.\par \par \uc2 Find out what you need to know about the 2016 presidential race today, and get politics news updates via \uc2 Facebook\uc2 , \uc2 Twitter\uc2  and the First Draft newsletter.\par \par \uc2 Document NYTF000020161020ecak0006k\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw272\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4080\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 Wonder Land\par \b \uc2 Dumb and Dumber\b0\par\par\uc2 By Daniel Henninger   \par \uc2 910 \uc2 words\par \uc2 20 October 2016\par \uc2 The Wall Street Journal\par \uc2 J\par A13\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 It's time to send the sniffer dogs into the rubble of America's 2016 presidential \uc2 election\uc2  to see if there's anything worth saving. We've learned some important things. We have learned that at the lower end of the income scale, the white vote is broken, or more accurately, brokenhearted. Many middle-class white voters are angry over a system they say has failed them.\par \par \uc2 They aren't the only ones. America's inner cities, its poorest neighborhoods, are increasingly on edge. One of these days, they could blow on the scale of the 1960s.\par \par \uc2 Much of this has to do with dismal job prospects, and better growth is part of the answer. But there's a bigger problem than growth -- the diminished state of American education.\par \par \uc2 Without an education upgrade that matches learning skills with modern jobs, all these people will still lose ground, and personal behavior will continue to degrade.\par \par \uc2 No better source of information exists on this than employers, especially manufacturers, who say U.S. schools, notwithstanding claims of improved "graduation" rates, are not producing sufficient numbers of workers able to perform at the level they need for the realities of the 21st century workplace. Apparently the universal skill of being able to manipulate a cellphone to take a selfie isn't enough.\par \par \uc2 During a September visit to a charter school in a black neighborhood on Cleveland's east side, \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  said, "I will be the nation's biggest cheerleader for school choice," and an advocate for merit pay "so that we reward our best teachers instead of the failed tenure system that rewards bad teachers and punishes the good ones."\par \par \uc2 He at least will say publicly that the U.S. public education system just doesn't work anymore for too many people.\par \par \uc2 The natural A-students will be fine. This reality allows many smart people to stop thinking about the country's most socially destructive problem. But for many others, elementary and secondary school is a drag on lifetime achievement. What the cry from the Trumpian heartland has revealed is that many rural schools also offer the same futureless education as inner-city schools.\par \par \uc2 These people aren't irredeemably stupid. Their schools are stupid. Fix the schools and half of America's myriad problems are solvable.\par \par \uc2 A new element is the descent of U.S. colleges and universities into PC hell. A basic mission, to prepare students for the new workplace, is being rechanneled into wheel-spinning controversies, such as "hurtful" speech or names on buildings. A \uc2 Clinton\uc2  win will empower this insanity.\par \par \uc2 Some of these institutions of higher learning actually brag about the remedial-education programs they offer first-year students who were waved through 12 years of inadequate public schooling. By 18, it's too late. They will never catch up.\par \par \uc2 Take your schools pick: \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  or \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 . It's no choice, because the proposed education policies of \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  (Wellesley, Yale) are, incredibly, a step back from the baby steps \uc2 Barack Obama\uc2  managed.\par \par \uc2 The National Education Association has spent $14 million so far to elect Hillary. The chances that a President \uc2 Clinton\uc2  would buck this industrial-age teachers union, whose raison d'etre is killing teacher accountability, are zero. Her web site extols pouring more federal money down the public-schools mine shaft.\par \par \uc2 The proven alternative is charter schools run by innovative educators or voucher-supported schools run by churches -- if they can survive. Talk to a charter-school leader like Eva Moskowitz in New York and she will tell you how they use squads of pro-bono, white-shoe lawyers to fight off nonstop litigation by the teachers unions hitting the streets for \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 The school-choice movement gets everything thrown at it, such as the 19th-century, anti-Catholic Blaine Amendments in 38 states that thwart support for poor kids attending parochial schools. The Podesta-Palmieri-Halpin emails make clear this hoary religious bias thrives in the post-Obama Democratic Party.\par \par \uc2 Back in his teleprompter-speech days, \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  appealed to black and Hispanic audiences. Many inner-city black Americans know Mr. Obama didn't do as much as they expected for their kids' education. In fact, he spent his entire presidency trying to defund the D.C. Opportunity Scholarship program.\par \par \uc2 That President Obama's daughters went to private Sidwell Friends in D.C. encapsulates this entire issue. It's not just Mr. Obama constantly self-referencing about how "folks like me" can substitute a Sidwell for public-school chaos. Most "folks like me" aren't in charge of the federal government, which has the authority to change the status quo. Instead, \uc2 Eric Holder\uc2 's Justice Department filed a lawsuit against Louisiana's successful voucher program for poor children.\par \par \uc2 The moral catastrophe of the schools is one of the issues that lets people pretend to themselves "it will get better" if Hillary wins. It won't. After she wins, this problem will remain -- lack of learned skills, lack of hope, an economy separating them from people like her smug campaign workers. One thing is certain: The anger will grow.\par \par \uc2 ---\par \par \uc2 Write henninger@wsj.com.\par \par \uc2 (See related letters: "Letters to the Editor: Public Education Must Give Better Results" -- WSJ Nov. 2, 2016)\par \par \uc2 (See related letter: "Letters to the Editor: Good Intentions but Poor Net Mainstreaming Results" -- WSJ Nov. 7, 2016)\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=wjco20161020000030"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document J000000020161020ecak0000t\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 Personal Tech; SECTB\par \b \uc2 How Tech Leaders Treat a \uc2 Trump\uc2  Backer\b0\par\par\uc2 By DAVID STREITFELD and MIKE ISAAC \par \uc2 845 \uc2 words\par \uc2 20 October 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 7\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 CORRECTION APPENDEDSAN FRANCISCO -- \uc2 Peter Thiel\uc2  made a relatively modest investment in the presidential candidacy of \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , but it is generating a major uproar in Silicon Valley.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  is toxic among technology investors and entrepreneurs. The news last weekend that Mr. Thiel was giving $1.25 million to the Republican's campaign is provoking outrage. And tech executives who work with the billionaire investor are being forced to explain why they plan to continue to do business with him.\par \par \uc2 Now Mr. Thiel will defend himself. A spokesman said Wednesday evening that he would address the controversy in a speech in Washington later this month. He declined to comment further.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Thiel was the first outside investor in \uc2 Facebook\uc2  and sits on its board. That has put the social media giant in the cross hairs of this debate. \uc2 Mark Zuckerberg\uc2 , Facebook's chief executive, warned that cutting ties with Mr. Thiel because of his political views would be a troubling precedent.\par \par \uc2 ''We care deeply about diversity,'' Mr. Zuckerberg wrote in an internal \uc2 Facebook\uc2  post to employees. ''That's easy to say when it means standing up for ideas you agree with. It's a lot harder when it means standing up for the rights of people with different viewpoints to say what they care about. That's even more important.''\par \par \uc2 An image of Mr. Zuckerberg's message to employees was posted on Tuesday to the website Hacker News, an online forum popular in technologist circles. \uc2 Facebook\uc2  confirmed the veracity of the photo and the post but had no further comment.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Thiel spoke at the Republican convention in July, where he said Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  ''is a builder, and it's time to rebuild America.'' That support incited some grumbling. But the complaints are louder this time, no doubt because the episode comes after the lewd ''Access Hollywood'' recording of Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 . Silicon Valley has been criticized in the last few years for its marginalization of women and lack of diversity.\par \par \uc2 Though Mr. Zuckerberg did not say that he agreed with Mr. Thiel's donation in his post, which went up a few days after The \uc2 New York Times\uc2  reported the donation, he warned that accepting differing political viewpoints was an essential part of \uc2 Facebook\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 His words echo a sentiment from \uc2 Sam Altman\uc2 , the president of the YC Group at \uc2 Y Combinator\uc2 . Mr. Altman, who has invested his own money in a campaign to turn out young voters, defended Mr. Thiel's position as a part-time partner at \uc2 Y Combinator\uc2 , a position he took last year.\par \par \uc2 ''Thiel is a high profile supporter of \uc2 Trump\uc2 . I disagree with this,'' Mr. Altman wrote in a series of \uc2 Twitter\uc2  posts on Sunday. But ''YC is not going to fire someone for supporting a major party nominee.''\par \par \uc2 Mr. Altman's arguments did not satisfy Marco Arment, the lead developer of Tumblr and the creator of Instapaper.\par \par \uc2 ''We have so many diversity and hostility problems (that the industry is finally working to fix) that \uc2 Y Combinator\uc2  should be leading the way toward inclusive, progressive solutions,'' Mr. Arment wrote on his blog. ''Instead, they're defending the large-scale support of racism, bigotry and sexual assault by an influential partner and adviser to their start-ups as its own form of 'diversity.'''\par \par \uc2 Earlier this week, Ellen Pao, the head of Project Include, an organization that is trying to increase diversity in the tech industry's work force, said her group was severing ties with \uc2 Y Combinator\uc2  because of Mr. Thiel's involvement.\par \par \uc2 ''We agree that people shouldn't be fired for their political views, but this isn't a disagreement on tax policy, this is advocating hatred and violence,'' Ms. Pao wrote on the site Medium.\par \par \uc2 Silicon Valley has been politicized in this \uc2 election\uc2  in a way it never was before. Mr. Zuckerberg has alluded to his opposition to some of Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's policies, once condemning Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's call to ''build a wall'' to stem the tide of illegal immigration from Mexico.\par \par \uc2 But in recent months he has guarded his political beliefs more closely, especially after claims were made that some conservative viewpoints were being blocked from wide visibility across the network by \uc2 Facebook\uc2  employees.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Zuckerberg now walks a fine line between what he describes as adhering to \uc2 Facebook\uc2 's core values of sharing and diversity of opinion and trying to avoid rankling the thousands of people he employs.\par \par \uc2 ''We can't create a culture that says it cares about diversity and then excludes almost half the country because they back a political candidate,'' he wrote.\par \par \uc2 Correction: October 24, 2016, Monday\par \par \uc2 This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article on Thursday about Silicon Valley's unease with contributions to the \uc2 Trump\uc2  campaign by the billionaire investor \uc2 Peter Thiel\uc2  misstated the job title of \uc2 Sam Altman\uc2  at \uc2 Y Combinator\uc2 , an incubator for tech start-ups. He is president of the YC Group, not managing director of YC Research.\par \par \uc2 Document NYTF000020161024ecak0000b\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw272\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4080\pichgoal600

Bender and Peter Nicholas   \par \uc2 1,218 \uc2 words\par \uc2 20 October 2016\par \uc2 The Wall Street Journal\par \uc2 J\par A1\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 LAS VEGAS -- \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  refused Wednesday to commit to respecting the results of the presidential \uc2 election\uc2  if his Democratic rival \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  wins, hinting at a challenge to one of the longtime traditions of American democracy.\par \par \uc2 "I will tell you at the time. I will keep you in suspense," the Republican nominee said here at the third and final presidential debate. "That's horrifying," Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  replied. "That is not the way our democracy works."\par \par \uc2 The debate at the \uc2 University of Nevada, Las Vegas\uc2  was a chance for Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  to regain momentum in the presidential race, which national and battleground state polls show Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  leading. But the evening's most striking moment came when moderator Chris Wallace asked if the GOP nominee would follow the guidance of his running mate \uc2 Mike Pence\uc2  and his daughter, Ivanka, and support the winner even if it wasn't him.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  demurred, and said Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's very candidacy was proof of conspiracy against him, citing her improper use of private email as secretary of state. "She should not be allowed to run. Just in that respect, I say it's rigged," he said.\par \par \uc2 Reaction was swift, and negative, from some quarters. "If he loses it will not be because the system is 'rigged,' but because he failed as a candidate," said \uc2 Sen. Lindsey Graham\uc2  (R., S.C.), who competed with Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  in the GOP primaries.\par \par \uc2 The debate started with a more measured tone compared with their first two showdowns, as Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  sought to present a more presidential posture that could reassure wavering Republicans and independents about his candidacy. He and Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  offered differing visions over social, economic and foreign policy, and attacked one another harshly over their personal conduct.\par \par \uc2 Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  pointed to his complaints about his defeat in the Iowa primary, the lawsuit against \uc2 Trump\uc2  University and losing an Emmy for his reality TV show. "Every time Donald thinks things are not going in his direction, he claims whatever it is, is rigged against him," she said.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's response to the query differed from the one he gave in the first debate. "If she wins, I will absolutely support her," he said then, though he added that he doubted she would win. The differing answers reflect the contours of the race over the course of the three presidential debates. At that time, polls were tighter and Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  was seen as having momentum. Since the first face-off in New York, the advantage has shifted to Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , giving her a double-digit lead in several national polls.\par \par \uc2 The bitterness that has developed in recent weeks between the two camps spilled over toward the end of the debate, when Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  interrupted Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  and called her "such a nasty woman."\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 election\uc2  has featured scant discussion over social issues, but Mr. Wallace put these matters on the table at the start with a discussion over the Supreme Court, a timely matter given that a vacancy currently on the court.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  promised he would appoint justices who would overturn the Roe v. Wade abortion decision and protect gun rights. "They will have a conservative bent," he said. "I will be appointing pro-life judges."\par \par \uc2 Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  said she would choose justices who would protect abortion rights, same-sex marriage and overturn \uc2 Citizens United\uc2 , which removed limits on corporate and union spending in elections. "The Supreme Court needs to stand on the side of the American people, not on the side of the powerful corporations and the wealthy," she said.\par \par \uc2 But the debate soon tilted toward the personal attacks that have dominated this presidential contest. Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  accused Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  of being a "puppet" of Russian President \uc2 Vladimir Putin\uc2 , whom she tied to the hack of her campaign chairman's personal email account. "No puppet," Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  shot back at Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 . "You're the puppet."\par \par \uc2 "It's pretty clear that you won't admit that the Russians engaged in cyberattacks, that you encouraged spying against our people, that you are willing to spout the Putin line," Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  said.\par \par \uc2 "She has no idea," Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  said. "Putin has outsmarted her at every step of the way."\par \par \uc2 On immigration, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  emphasized border security, and the wall he wants to build on the southern border. "We have no country if we have no border," he said. He accused Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  of supporting "amnesty" for those in the country illegally.\par \par \uc2 Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  said she voted when she was in the Senate for border security as part of a larger immigration package, but wants to give safe harbor to illegal immigrant already living in the U.S. "I don't want to rip families apart. I don't want to be sending parents away from children," she said. "I don't want to see the deportation force that Donald has talked about in action in our country."\par \par \uc2 On the economy, Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  offered a positive vision, something her advisers saw as an imperative for her going into the debate. She promised the "biggest jobs program since World War II" by investing in infrastructure and advanced manufacturing. She said she would increase the minimum wage and make college "debt free" for some middle-class families.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  said he wanted to "get government out of the taxes and regulations" and promised to end the \uc2 North American Free Trade Agreement\uc2 , the free-trade agreement with Mexico and Canada.\par \par \uc2 "We are going to cut taxes massively," Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  said. "We are going to start the engine rolling again."\par \par \uc2 He blamed Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  and her husband, former President \uc2 Bill \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , for Nafta, which Mr. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  signed, and for backing the pending Trans Pacific Partnership. Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  again vowed to oppose the Asian trade deal but moved fast to turn the trade issue against Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , saying he had bought Chinese steel and aluminum for his buildings. Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  replied that Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  had been in office for 30 years and asked why she didn't "make it impossible for me to do that."\par \par \uc2 The question of Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's conduct with women again surfaced. He accused the women who have charged since the last debate that he groped or kissed them without permission of lying. "I think they want either fame or her campaign did it. I think it's her campaign," he said.\par \par \uc2 Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  replied by quoting Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's defense, offered at rallies, that these women weren't attractive enough to warrant such advances.\par \par \uc2 "Donald thinks belittling women makes him bigger. He goes after their dignity, their self-worth, and I don't think there is a woman anywhere who doesn't know what that feels like," she said.\par \par \uc2 Leaving here after their final debate, the Democratic nominee has the upper hand heading into the home stretch, leading in many polls and enjoying a big cash advantage as the candidates concentrate on Ohio, North Carolina and Pennsylvania, where both will be campaigning in the coming days, as well as Florida.\par \par \uc2 ---\par \par \uc2 Rebecca Ballhaus and Janet Hook contributed to this article.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=wjco20161020000115"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document J000000020161020ecak00030\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw272\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4080\pichgoal600

In Wednesday's debate Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  showed what might have been had he fought more on the issues, even as he also exposed his Achilles' heel of a thin skin and petulant ego.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  is never going to out-argue \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  on details, but for much of the debate he was able to draw a contrast on philosophical direction that is his best chance to close his polling deficit. He was effective on the Supreme Court and the right to bear arms, as well as embracing the original meaning of the Constitution.\par \par \uc2 Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  tried to muddy her opposition to the landmark Heller case that upheld an individual right to bear arms in the Constitution, but Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  nailed her on it. She certainly would appoint Justices who will sharply curtail if not overturn Heller.\par \par \uc2 The Republican also managed to convey the large differences between the two candidates on the economy. He'd cut taxes, she'd raise them. He'd replace ObamaCare, she'd expand it. He wants to grow incomes with a stronger economy, she wants to redistribute income. Her claim that her plan would "not add a penny to the debt" was preposterous.\par \par \uc2 We think Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  is wrong on trade and his assertions on Nafta are nonsense, but he did manage to show Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's double dealing on the issue. Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  said she opposed the Pacific trade agreement only after she had read the text, but the \uc2 WikiLeaks\uc2  documents show that she had already decided to oppose it for political reasons before it was completed.\par \par \uc2 Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  also ducked moderator Chris Wallace's question on the \uc2 Clinton\uc2  Foundation\uc2  and its "pay to play" acceptance of donations from foreigners while she was Secretary of State. Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  was right to hit her and her husband for claiming to do so much for Haiti when they have mainly helped their friends to favorable contracts.\par \par \uc2 The question is whether any of this will matter given Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's manifest flaws in temperament. The \uc2 Clinton\uc2  campaign must have done some psychological profiling of Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  to figure out that his great flaw is his inability to ignore or deflect personal criticism. His GOP opponents made the mistake of trying to take him down on substance. But Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  has tried to disqualify him on character, and Wednesday she continued to set one bear trap after another. Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  usually walked in.\par \par \uc2 She made him look especially small on the matter of his women accusers, as Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  lashed back at her and accused the women of being set up by the \uc2 Clinton\uc2  campaign. Even if they were, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  needs to do far better than he is doing among women voters to win on Nov. 8. And those voters would like to have seen some humility, if not remorse, instead of a boast that "nobody has more respect for women than I do." After the Billy Bush video, that doesn't wash.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's biggest mistake was his refusal to say he would accept the \uc2 election\uc2  results if he loses. "I will look at it at the time," Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  said in reply to Mr. Wallace. Asked again by Fox News' Mr. Wallace -- by far the best moderator of this \uc2 election\uc2  year with his focus on substance -- Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  made it worse by saying "I will keep you in suspense, okay?"\par \par \uc2 That again is Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's ego talking, a man who doesn't like to lose refusing to take responsibility for his campaign. Voters on the right and left want to have faith in the electoral system. Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's statement makes us wonder if Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  and adviser Steve Bannon are planning to blame everyone else if he does lose. It's true that Al Gore tried to steal the 2000 \uc2 election\uc2  from George W. Bush until the Supreme Court finally intervened, but that is not an example any Republican should want to follow.\par \par \uc2 The hard reality of this campaign is that it was set up for a Republican victory. A divided and unhappy country wants to move in a new direction. Even Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , after all his mistakes, had essentially tied the race before the first debate. Win or lose in three weeks, the result will be one that he has earned.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=wjco20161020000126"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document J000000020161020ecak00031\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  has built a commanding lead over \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2  in national polls, but she still has one big weakness: white working-class voters, especially men.\par \par \uc2 Even now, she is underperforming any recent Democratic candidate among white voters without a college degree.\par \par \uc2 It's a very different story from 2008, when \uc2 Barack Obama\uc2  built a big national lead by attracting white working-class voters in states like Wisconsin and Indiana.\par \par \uc2 Instead, Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's gains come from big margins among well-educated voters and an electorate that's much more diverse than it was even a decade ago.\par \par \uc2 The result is a sharp increase in polarization along demographic lines of race, education and gender -- yet a decrease in geographic polarization. The predictable electoral map of the last four elections, born in part of the culture wars and split along familiar regional divides, might not look quite the same this November.\par \par \uc2 This dynamic helps explain why reliably red states are now on the verge of competitiveness, even as some traditional battleground states haven't budged.\par \par \uc2 Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  is struggling where Mr. Obama depended heavily on the support of white working-class voters four years ago. Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , on the other hand, is struggling where there are few opportunities for him to improve among white working-class voters, or where Republicans depend on well-educated white voters.\par \par \uc2 Take Iowa, a state that has voted Democratic in six of the last seven presidential elections. When Democrats barely lost the state in 2004, it was still a stronger state for \uc2 John Kerry\uc2  than the nation as a whole. President Obama won the state by six points four years ago, and he ran well ahead of Mr. Kerry and Al Gore in white working-class areas.\par \par \uc2 Yet Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  has held a clear lead in the state -- like a four-point lead in the last Des Moines Register/Selzer poll conducted two weeks ago.\par \par \uc2 The reason is straightforward: Of all of the battleground states, there isn't a place where a larger share of Mr. Obama's voters were whites without a degree. Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's struggles among white working-class voters hurt more here than elsewhere.\par \par \uc2 That struggle is playing out across the North, where Mr. Obama fared well among white voters four years ago. Ohio, the anchor of Mr. Obama's so-called Midwestern firewall, remains very close. Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  has fared better in Wisconsin, but she's not necessarily doing better there than she is nationwide.\par \par \uc2 The dynamic is also keeping many of the red, working-class states where Mr. Obama was competitive in 2008 -- like Missouri, Montana and Indiana -- out of the Democratic column.\par \par \uc2 Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  may yet sweep the Midwest, winning in places like Iowa and Ohio. But if she does prevail, she might do so in a very different way than Mr. Obama did four years ago.\par \par \uc2 She is making up for her weakness with strength in some of the most reliably Republican turf in the country. She's running even with Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  in the Milwaukee suburbs; she leads in Western Michigan; and she's posting huge leads in suburbs around Columbus, Ohio, and Philadelphia.\par \par \uc2 She's struggling mightily in some traditionally Democratic or competitive areas like Green Bay, Wis.; northeastern Pennsylvania, including Scranton; northeastern Ohio, including Youngstown; and Macomb County, Mich. -- the place that inspired the term ''Reagan Democrats.''\par \par \uc2 This balance between Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's weakness among white working-class Northerners and her strength among well-educated voters might be enough to preserve a relatively similar electoral outcome in the Midwest, even as the underlying coalitions shift significantly. But this trade-off is not nearly as favorable for Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  in the states where there is much less room for him to make gains among white working-class voters.\par \par \uc2 In the red states, Mr. Obama was far weaker among white voters. That means there's a lot of room for Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  to fall among well-educated voters there, and little room to gain among white working-class voters.\par \par \uc2 In 2012, \uc2 Mitt Romney\uc2  surpassed 75 percent or even 80 percent of white voters without a degree in North Carolina, Georgia and Utah. Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  could be aided by higher turnout, but he doesn't have much room for additional gains.\par \par \uc2 The traditional red-state, blue-state map of the 2000-12 era was driven in part by culture war politics, which split white voters along religious lines. The country's religious divisions parallel its regional splits, with religious and evangelical white voters heavily concentrated in the South. The Republicans made huge gains among white working-class voters in the South and Appalachia, but relatively secular and working-class Northern voters in Scranton, northern Ohio or Iowa mostly stuck with the Democrats through it all.\par \par \uc2 But the old culture war is effectively over. There have been few or no campaign advertisements about same-sex marriage or abortion in most places. This \uc2 election\uc2  is a hint of one way things could turn next: a new split between the beneficiaries of multicultural globalism and the working-class ethnonationalists who feel left behind economically and culturally. It wouldn't divide the country as much by region and religion, but more along the lines of urbanization and education.\par \par \uc2 It's a trend across Europe, where there never was a culture war quite like that in the United States. It's too early to say whether the trend will take hold in the United States, but this \uc2 election\uc2  has certainly raised the possibility.\par \par \uc2 The Upshot provides news, analysis and graphics about politics, policy and everyday life.

\par\par \uc2 EDITORIAL\par \uc2 Editorial Desk; SECTA\par \b \uc2 Marijuana Lights Up State Ballots\b0\par\par\uc2 By THE EDITORIAL BOARD \par \uc2 580 \uc2 words\par \uc2 20 October 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 26\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 People in nine states, including California, Florida and Massachusetts, will vote Nov. 8 on ballot proposals permitting recreational or medical use of marijuana. These initiatives could give a big push to legalization, prompting the next president and Congress to overhaul the country's failed drug laws.\par \par \uc2 This is a big moment for what was a fringe movement a few years ago. A Gallup poll released on Wednesday showed 60 percent of Americans support legalizing marijuana, up from 31 percent in 2000 and 12 percent in 1969.\par \par \uc2 The drive to end prohibition comes after decades in which marijuana laws led to millions of people being arrested and tens of thousands sent to prison, a vast majority of whom never committed any violent crimes. These policies have had a particularly devastating effect on minority communities. Federal and state governments have spent untold billions of dollars on enforcement, money that could have been much better spent on mental health and substance abuse treatment.\par \par \uc2 So far, Alaska, Colorado, Oregon, Washington and the District of Columbia have legalized recreational use of marijuana, and 25 states permit medical use. A recent \uc2 Cato Institute\uc2  study found that the states that have legalized recreational use have so far had no meaningful uptick in the use of marijuana by teenagers, or other negative consequences predicted by opponents. For example, in Colorado, drug-related expulsions and suspensions from schools have gone down in recent years. There has been no spike in drug-related traffic accidents and fatalities in Colorado or Washington.\par \par \uc2 On \uc2 Election\uc2  Day, voters in Arizona, California, Maine, Massachusetts and Nevada will consider proposals to allow recreational use. In California, which approved medical use in 1996, polls show that the measure is likely to win. In Massachusetts, a recent poll showed 55 percent of likely voters supporting legalization. In Arkansas, Florida, Montana and North Dakota, residents will vote on medical marijuana. If Florida voters say yes, other Southern states that have been resistant to liberalizing drug laws could reconsider their prohibitions, too.\par \par \uc2 Passage of these proposals should increase pressure on the federal government to change how it treats marijuana. The Obama administration has chosen not to enforce federal antimarijuana laws in states like Colorado and Washington. But this bizarre situation can't last -- even as more states legalize the drug, state-licensed marijuana businesses remain criminal operations under federal law. Even if they are not prosecuted by the federal government, this conflict in their legal status creates immense problems.\par \par \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  has promised to move marijuana from Schedule 1 of the Controlled Substances Act (for drugs like heroin and LSD that have no accepted medical use) to Schedule 2, which includes opioid drugs that are medically useful but have a ''high potential for abuse.'' While that change would be an improvement, that classification would not eliminate contradictions between federal and state laws when it comes to recreational use of marijuana. Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  has said he supports the medical use of marijuana, but has opposed full legalization.\par \par \uc2 States are driving the change in marijuana policy because they see the damage created by draconian drug laws on communities, families and state budgets. It's time the federal government acknowledged these costs and got out of the way of states adopting more rational laws.\par \par \uc2 Follow The \uc2 New York Times\uc2  Opinion section on \uc2 Facebook\uc2  and \uc2 Twitter\uc2  (@NYTOpinion), and sign up for the Opinion Today newsletter.\par \par \uc2 DRAWING (DRAWING BY CHRISTOPHER DELORENZO) \par \par \uc2 Document NYTF000020161020ecak0006g\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  turned, in the third and final presidential debate, from insulting the intelligence of the American voter to insulting American democracy itself. He falsely insisted there were ''millions of people'' registered to participate in the \uc2 election\uc2  who did not have the right to vote and declared he would not commit to honoring the outcome.\par \par \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  was clearly shocked that he was attacking the very foundation of the republic, the American tradition of peacefully transferring power. ''That's horrifying,'' she said, rightly. At one point, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  even said, outrageously, ''She shouldn't be allowed to run.''\par \par \uc2 The presidential debate was another exercise in narcissism, bombast and mendacity by Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 . One could only hope that this might be the last grand display of his gross unfitness to be president.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  arrived at the debate in Las Vegas after days of making venomous attacks on the democratic process, and by implication, the voters' ability to make sound choices. Asked about whether he would accept the \uc2 election\uc2  result, he tersely answered, ''I will look at it at the time.'' In rejecting his answer, Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  noted that Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  is a chronic complainer when he loses, even in an Emmy award competition. But applying his loser's lament to an American presidential \uc2 election\uc2  is a far different proposition than whining about a TV show. ''He is talking down our democracy,'' Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  warned.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  and Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  clashed over Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's favorable view of President \uc2 Vladimir Putin\uc2  of Russia. She pointed out that Russian hackers have been traced by numerous government intelligence agencies as the source of leaks undermining the Democratic Party and the American \uc2 election\uc2 . Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  defended the Russian leader, insisting he had no close relationship with him, but that Mr. Putin had ''outsmarted'' Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  ''every step of the way.''\par \par \uc2 They clashed as well on the issue of abortion, with Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  noting Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  had previously said abortion should be illegal and women who have them should be punished and that he also wants to defund \uc2 Planned Parenthood\uc2 . Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  said he would appoint anti-abortion justices to the Supreme Court.\par \par \uc2 And he stood by his insistence that he would build a massive wall across the Mexican border. ''We have some bad hombres here,'' he said, maintaining his insulting allegations that Mexican immigrants are criminals. Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , clearly trying to needle her thin-skinned opponent, said he ducked the issue in his visit to the Mexican president: ''He choked.''\par \par \uc2 The debate was tightly directed by the moderator, Chris Wallace, but Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  showed no inclination to back off his bullying and cunning in keeping the focus on himself rather than on the problems of the nation.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  again faced the issue that sent his reputation into a tailspin in recent opinion polls -- his hot-microphone bragging in 2005 that he sexually assaulted women. Women have come forward to offer evidence of instances of abuse, and Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  insisted, falsely, that the accusations have been debunked. ''They want either fame, or her campaign did it,'' he said. ''She got these people to step forward,'' he said of Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , as usual offering no evidence for his claims.\par \par \uc2 ''Nobody has more respect for women than I do,'' Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  declared, in one of his more transparent lies of the night.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's meltdown in the closing weeks could be dismissed as a sore loser's bizarre attempt at rationalizing his likely defeat. But his trashing of the democratic process, in service of his own ego, risks lasting damage to the country, and politicians of both parties should recoil from him and his cynical example.\par \par \uc2 Document NYTF000020161020ecak0006i\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 Washington; SECT\par \b \uc2 12 Questions We'd Like to Hear at the Presidential Debate\b0\par\par\uc2 By THE NEW YORK TIMES \par \uc2 1,785 \uc2 words\par \uc2 20 October 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 The New York Times on the Web\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  and \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2  will meet on Wednesday night at the \uc2 University of Nevada, Las Vegas\uc2 , for their final debate of the presidential \uc2 election\uc2 . The moderator, Chris Wallace of ''Fox News Sunday,'' has divided the hour-and-a-half event into six 15-minute segments, to cover immigration, the Supreme Court, entitlements and debt, the economy, foreign policy and fitness for office.\par \par \uc2 The questions \uc2 New York Times\uc2  correspondents would like to hear:\par \par \uc2 Entitlements\par \par \uc2 Do you favor increasing or reducing Social Security benefits? If so, how would you do it?\par \par \uc2 More than 60 million people each month receive Social Security benefits totaling more than $74 billion. Polls show that retirement security is a top concern for Americans. Fewer people can count on traditional pension benefits, and some people do not have retirement savings.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  has said he would not cut Social Security benefits. Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  wants to make Social Security more generous for widows and for those who take time out of the paid work force to care for a child or a sick family member. She has said she would require the wealthiest Americans to pay higher taxes.\par \par \uc2 But an aging population is a driver of rising government debt and of a budget deficit that climbed last fiscal year after several years of decline.\par \par \uc2 What three steps would you take to improve Medicare?\par \par \uc2 The aging of baby boomers and the increase of medical costs will squeeze the health insurance program, which now covers 57 million older Americans. Medicare trustees say the hospital insurance trust fund could be exhausted in 2028 if no changes are made to existing law.\par \par \uc2 Both Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  and Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  say Medicare should be able to negotiate prices with pharmaceutical companies. Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  has proposed allowing people ages 55 to 64 to buy into Medicare, but has not said how the government or the new beneficiaries would pay for the coverage. ROBERT PEAR\par \par \uc2 Immigration\par \par \uc2 Since 2012, hundreds of thousands of illegal immigrants who were brought to the United States as children have registered with the government under President Obama's executive order that gives them work permits and guarantees they will not be deported. Will you honor those guarantees?\par \par \uc2 Frustrated by Republicans' refusal to overhaul the nation's immigration system, Mr. Obama used executive authority to provide opportunities for millions of law-abiding immigrants who are in the country illegally. But the Supreme Court has blocked some of his plan, and the next president will have the power to reverse the rest.\par \par \uc2 The war in Syria has created a huge migrant crisis. What is the appropriate level of migration from Syria that the United States should allow, and how would you guarantee that those coming into our country from a region struggling with terrorism do not mean us harm?\par \par \uc2 The United States has confronted these questions throughout its history: How open should its borders be to those fleeing oppression and violence? Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  dramatically proposed barring all Muslims, and later amended his idea to propose ''extreme vetting'' for anyone from countries like Syria or Libya, where extremism is rampant. Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  has accused her rival of xenophobia. She has said the United States should expand the number of Syrians allowed entry. The future flows of migrants from Syria and other hot spots will probably be determined by the outcome of the presidential contest. MICHAEL D. SHEAR\par \par \uc2 The Economy\par \par \uc2 The economy has grown slowly in recent years, and one reason is a prolonged slump in productivity growth. What steps would your administration take to encourage innovation and investment?\par \par \uc2 Modern prosperity was created by a huge increase in worker productivity. As the output of the average worker increases, so does the standard of living. But in recent years, that engine has been sputtering. Since the deep recession of 2008, labor productivity in the United States has increased by just 1 percent a year -- less than half the annual pace since 1947. At the current pace, our standard of living will double once every 70 years, instead of doubling once every 30 years.\par \par \uc2 The government can improve productivity by encouraging the creation and diffusion of new technologies through changes in taxation and regulation. It can also play a more direct role, by improving the quality of public education or by making its own investments. Federal research and development funding fell to 0.78 percent of gross domestic product last year, down from 1 percent in 2009.\par \par \uc2 Around seven million men ages 25 to 54 are neither working nor looking for work. How would you help prime-age men who are sitting on the sidelines of the American economy?\par \par \uc2 The unemployment rate stood at 5 percent in September, a healthy number that concealed a host of deeper problems. One of the most perplexing: the rise of nonworking men. About 15 percent of prime-age men do not have jobs, up from about 5 percent in the 1960s. Most of them are not looking for work, so they are not counted in the unemployment rate. But they are a drag on the economy: They do not produce, but they continue to consume.\par \par \uc2 In an earlier generation, they might have found jobs in factories or other blue-collar occupations. Now they spend, on average, almost six hours a day watching television.\par \par \uc2 Economic growth is an incomplete corrective. Many nonworking men are ill equipped for the jobs that are available. Federal regulations, or restrictions on immigration, might induce employers to offer better pay and benefits. Restrictions on the availability of federal benefits might induce men to look for work. BINYAMIN APPELBAUM\par \par \uc2 Supreme Court\par \par \uc2 On Monday, Senator \uc2 John McCain\uc2  of Arizona said Republicans ''will be united against any Supreme Court nominee that \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , if she were president, would put up.'' What are the Senate's obligations to consider presidential nominations to the Supreme Court?\par \par \uc2 A spokeswoman for Mr. McCain later tried to soften his remarks, but the suggestion that the current Supreme Court vacancy could last indefinitely was startling. In its last term, the court, down a justice since Antonin Scalia's death in February, deadlocked in major cases on immigration and public unions, and it issued a muddled compromise ruling in a religious challenge to contraception coverage requirements.\par \par \uc2 And the next president will very likely face additional vacancies, as Justice Stephen G. Breyer is 78, Justice \uc2 Anthony M. Kennedy\uc2  is 80 and Justice \uc2 Ruth Bader Ginsburg\uc2  is 83.\par \par \uc2 Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , if you are elected, will you urge the Senate to confirm Mr. Obama's Supreme Court nominee, Judge \uc2 Merrick B. Garland\uc2 , in its lame-duck session? Will you renominate him?\par \par \uc2 Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's support for Judge Garland has been notably mild. At the last debate, she said only that ''I regret deeply that the Senate has not done its job and they have not permitted a vote,'' adding that Judge Garland was ''a highly qualified person.''\par \par \uc2 Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's statements may reflect a strategic calculation in a game of constitutional chicken. By hinting that she would nominate someone more liberal and younger than Judge Garland, who is 63 and generally viewed as a moderate, she may be prodding the Senate to act.\par \par \uc2 Or perhaps she thinks the court could use a forceful liberal voice from a younger nominee. In a radio interview, she said she would ''look broadly and widely for people who represent the diversity of our country.'' Judge Garland is a white man. \uc2 ADAM LIPTAK\par \par \uc2 International Hot Spots\par \par \uc2 How would you respond to Russia's recent aggression, from Ukraine to Syria to the hacking of the Democratic Party?\par \par \uc2 The United States and the \uc2 European Union\uc2  have already imposed significant economic sanctions on people and businesses close to President \uc2 Vladimir V. Putin\uc2  in retaliation for Russia's annexation of Crimea and its role in destabilizing Ukraine. Mr. Obama gambled that Mr. Putin's adventurism in Ukraine and Syria would eventually backfire for Russia. But there is little evidence that Russia's military entanglements have eroded Mr. Putin's popularity.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Obama has argued, with some justification, that confronting Russia militarily in Ukraine would be a losing battle, since Ukraine means much more to Russia than it does to the United States. In Syria, a more aggressive American military presence would risk a clash with Russian warplanes. The Obama administration has hinted that it will respond to Russia's hacking with covert action, potentially a cyberattack of its own. But it is not clear that this would be enough to stop the Russians from a strategy they believe has produced dividends.\par \par \uc2 How would you differ from Mr. Obama in your handling of the Syrian war?\par \par \uc2 Both Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  and Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  have criticized Mr. Obama's inaction in Syria, although they differ radically on the proper prescription for a war that has lasted more than five years and caused hundreds of thousands of deaths. Part of the problem is setting priorities: Should the United States continue to call for the ouster of President Bashar al-Assad when it is also trying to uproot the Islamic State from Iraq and Syria?\par \par \uc2 Syria has become a proxy war for a multitude of players -- Russia, Iran, Turkey and the Persian Gulf states -- each with its own competing and overlapping interests. The trick for the next president is to find a solution that will end the killing and somehow win the support, or at least the acquiescence, of the many actors with interests in Syria. MARK LANDLER\par \par \uc2 Fitness for Office\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , you have repeatedly made false claims during the campaign. Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , you have been less than forthright about classified emails. How do you assure Americans that you will be honest and truthful?\par \par \uc2 Many Americans have already concluded that both candidates are liars. Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  and Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  need to show that they have strategies for moving beyond that deeply held impression.\par \par \uc2 Both of you have a demonstrated record of putting your personal financial concerns first -- Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , with your speaking fees and accusations over suspect commodities trades, and Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , with your trail of business failures that left others with the bill. How can people be assured that you can separate your own interests from the decisions a president must make?\par \par \uc2 Both candidates are extremely wealthy, with a web of family finances that could be influenced by executive branch decisions. They need to explain to the public how they can separate the two and make decisions without consideration to themselves.

\par\par \uc2 OP-ED CONTRIBUTOR\par \uc2 Editorial Desk; SECTA\par \b \uc2 Keeping the Iran Deal Alive\b0\par\par\uc2 By ARIANE TABATABAI \par \uc2 795 \uc2 words\par \uc2 20 October 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 27\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 WASHINGTON -- With every presidential debate this year, Americans are reminded that the Iran nuclear deal remains as controversial as ever. Iranians, too, are watching the \uc2 election\uc2 , dreading the potential consequences for the deal -- and for their country's future.\par \par \uc2 With only three months before the Obama administration leaves office, the United States and Iran need to work fast to strengthen the deal's foundations and ensure that the improvement in relations that took place over the course of President Obama's tenure survives.\par \par \uc2 Both presidential nominees will most likely increase pressure on Tehran, but they differ on the nuclear deal. Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2  has denounced it as ''one of the worst deals ever negotiated.'' \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , on the other hand, played a role in forging it and has pledged to continue its implementation. But she has also vowed to be tough on Iran for its ballistic missile program and its support for terrorism.\par \par \uc2 Iran is also preparing for presidential elections, scheduled for May. The contenders haven't yet announced their candidacies, but President Hassan Rouhani, a moderate, is likely to face tough conservative challengers, some of whom opposed negotiations with the Americans and believe he agreed to too many concessions. His opponents say that the deal affords Iran no tangible benefits because, although sanctions have been lifted, the economy has hardly recovered.\par \par \uc2 Against this backdrop, the nuclear agreement will enter the second year of implementation in early 2017.\par \par \uc2 But even now, there are many challenges to Iranian-American relations. Iran has tested the United States by arresting American citizens, continuing its ballistic missile program and conducting cyberattacks against American interests. For its part, the \uc2 United States Congress\uc2  has placed obstacles in the way of the deal's implementation, such as trying to stall the sale of civilian aircraft to Iran. And while the State Department has tried to encourage businesses to re-enter the Iranian market, many remain reluctant because the Treasury Department has been slow to provide clarity on sanctions.\par \par \uc2 But thanks to open channels of communication between Washington and Tehran, nothing yet has derailed the nuclear deal.\par \par \uc2 Secretary of State \uc2 John Kerry\uc2  and Foreign Minister Javad Zarif of Iran have developed a good working relationship. In January, communication between the two led to the quick release of American sailors who were detained after entering Iranian waters. These channels are one of the greatest achievements of the nuclear talks and key to the deal's success, allowing two adversaries to finally settle disputes diplomatically. But unless these means of dialogue are sustained, hiccups could turn into bigger crises, ultimately undoing the improvement in relations -- and the nuclear deal.\par \par \uc2 To protect them, the United States and Iran should institutionalize their relationship. The State Department and \uc2 Iran's Foreign Ministry\uc2  should have conversations not just at the highest levels, but across their diplomatic corps. By starting now to move interactions with Iran from top-level political appointees to others within the State Department, the United States can create the building blocks for the next administration.\par \par \uc2 Another key channel of communication has been between Secretary of Energy \uc2 Ernest Moniz\uc2  and Ali Akbar Salehi, the head of the \uc2 Atomic Energy Organization of Iran\uc2 . But this, too, will be jeopardized when Mr. Moniz leaves office. Mr. Salehi will remain an important player, but there is no guarantee he will enjoy similarly friendly ties with the next energy secretary. This is why the United States and Iran should work now to establish contact between lower-level officials and technical experts, including between American labs and their Iranian counterparts.\par \par \uc2 Iran and the United States should also work to tackle long-term challenges. Treasury Secretary Jack Lew met with Valiollah Seif, the head of \uc2 Iran's Central Bank\uc2 , in April, but there is still no formal mechanism for their agencies to talk. Creating one could help ease Iran's concerns about sanctions relief.\par \par \uc2 These steps will allow the two countries to identify, clarify and address contentious issues before they turn into crises. Many of these challenges stem from domestic politics, so the two sides must be able to explain their own domestic pressures to each other. This will allow the two capitals to better understand and explain these challenges at home.\par \par \uc2 This, in turn, will allow Washington and Tehran to strengthen the foundations of the nuclear deal and ensure its longevity. Without formalizing these relationships and ensuring that they can survive changes in government, the deal won't produce the optimal effect each side seeks: allowing Iran's economy to recover while ensuring Tehran doesn't acquire a nuclear weapon.\par \par \uc2 Ariane Tabatabai is a visiting assistant professor at Georgetown and a senior associate at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.\par \par \uc2 Document NYTF000020161020ecak0006b\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 STATE OF THE ART\par \uc2 Business/Financial Desk; SECTB\par \b \uc2 The Age of Email Is Nearing an End\b0\par\par\uc2 By FARHAD MANJOO \par \uc2 1,475 \uc2 words\par \uc2 20 October 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 1\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Every four years, pundits race to anoint this or that newfangled tech trend as the next disruptive force to forever alter the mechanics of American democracy. The 2016 campaign has already been called the Snapchat \uc2 election\uc2 , the Periscope \uc2 election\uc2 , the Meerkat \uc2 election\uc2 , the \uc2 Twitter\uc2 election\uc2 , the \uc2 Facebook\uc2 election\uc2  and the meme \uc2 election\uc2 . (If there were a vomit emoji, I'd insert one here. And then we'd have the emoji \uc2 election\uc2 .)\par \par \uc2 Yet for months this bizarre campaign has been defined less by cutting-edge technology than by one of the most established: email. It's 2016, and we're blessed with an embarrassment of ways to securely and conveniently communicate with one another. But all anyone can talk about is \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's damn emails.\par \par \uc2 This column is not about the real or imagined scandals exposed by caches of Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's and her campaign staff's messages, which, thanks to the State Department, Russian hackers, \uc2 Judicial Watch\uc2  and \uc2 WikiLeaks\uc2  now regularly spill into public view.\par \par \uc2 Instead, let's examine a more basic mystery buried in the emails: Why were all these people discussing so much over email in the first place? Haven't they heard of phone calls? Face-to-face meetings in dimly lit Washington parking garage? Anyplace else where their conversations weren't constantly being recorded, archived and rendered searchable for decades to come?\par \par \uc2 The answer, of course, is that email is as tempting as it is inescapable, for Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  as well as for the rest of us. More than 50 years after its birth, email exerts an uncanny hold on all of our internal affairs.\par \par \uc2 But everything must meet its maker, and for email, that time is nigh.\par \par \uc2 The sudden exposure of the \uc2 Clinton\uc2  campaign email cache is perhaps the ultimate evidence that we've all overcommitted to email -- we've put too much in it, expected too much from it, and now, finally, we're seeing the spectacular signs of its impending destruction.\par \par \uc2 Email is simply not up to the rigors of modern political and business life. It lulls us into a sense of unguarded security that it never delivers. It entices us to spill our darkest secrets, and then makes those secrets available to any halfway decent hacker. There are several alternatives that could take its place, without the same pitfalls, and the \uc2 Clinton\uc2  cache shows why we would be wise to adopt one of them.\par \par \uc2 Let's pour one out for email, which has had quite a run. Then let's move on to something else, and dance on email's grave.\par \par \uc2 The latest \uc2 Clinton\uc2  emails come from the hacked Gmail account of \uc2 John D. Podesta\uc2 , Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's campaign chairman. I emailed the campaign to ask about the breach and email security practices, but I got no response. (Maybe they've shied away from email?) The campaign has refused to confirm the authenticity of the messages, which speaks to one of the shortcomings of email: It can easily be forged, so there's no good way for anyone reading those messages to confirm that they really are the \uc2 Clinton\uc2  campaign's.\par \par \uc2 But if you assume the messages are authentic, you quickly discover even more shortcomings of email. What's most striking about the Podesta cache is how central email has been to the campaign's operations. In 2016, presidential campaigns, like all large enterprises, are far-flung operations. Lots of people in lots of different places are trying to plan things together. To the extent there's any centrality to the organization, it's in email communication.\par \par \uc2 You can see why this can be handy. Having a single place to discuss everything makes teams more efficient. In the \uc2 Clinton\uc2  campaign, email is used as a way to convey news, to set out tactics and strategy, to theorize, to push back, to gossip. It's used in place of phone calls and face-to-face meetings; it's used as an instant messenger, a daily calendar and a collaborative whiteboard.\par \par \uc2 ''It suggests that they hadn't had their sense of security punctured yet,'' said \uc2 Adam Segal\uc2 , an expert on cybersecurity at the \uc2 Council on Foreign Relations\uc2  and the author of ''The Hacked World Order.'' ''Once you have had that breached, you don't go back to that world where you write down sensitive things in email. If you have something sensitive to say, you're going to use the phone or walk down the hallway.''\par \par \uc2 One thread from the spring of 2015 is instructive, suggesting both email's advantages and its enormous flaws. Over the course of three days, a half dozen senior members of the campaign used email to discuss a sensitive topic: Should the campaign allow people who lobby on behalf of foreign governments, known as registered foreign agents, to raise donations on its behalf? Experts on the issue went over the legal and political ramifications, and various members weighed in on two ideas -- take no money from foreign agents, or take some money on a case-by-case basis, depending on the foreign government the agent represented. (Canada would be O.K.; North Korea would not.)\par \par \uc2 By the second day of discussions, the thread was getting long and going nowhere, so Robby Mook, the campaign manager, proposed a quick phone call to hash out the idea. He almost apologized for suggesting a call, which he worried was too grown-up, ''too processy.''\par \par \uc2 The phone call apparently happened. But in the \uc2 Clinton\uc2  campaign, even a phone call needed to be documented in email. So after the call, another staff member reported on the decision made during the call: to bar any donations from foreign agents.\par \par \uc2 But it didn't end there. Marc E. Elias, the campaign's general counsel, then chimed in to say that he hadn't been on the call but that he opposed the ban on foreign donations, which he said would feel arbitrary.\par \par \uc2 That set off another round of discussions, sparking annoyance among some people on the thread. Finally, Mr. Mook wrote in to say that thanks to Mr. Elias, he had changed his mind, and was now leaning toward taking money from foreign agents. ''Are you guys O.K. with that?'' he asked.\par \par \uc2 That prompted the kicker from Jennifer Palmieri, the campaign's communications director: ''Take the money!!'' she wrote from her iPhone.\par \par \uc2 In the days following \uc2 WikiLeaks\uc2 ' publication, this thread became a campaign issue. Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2  even drew attention to Ms. Palmieri's line at a rally this week.\par \par \uc2 But it didn't have to be so. If they had been using some other system to communicate, they would most likely have avoided this trouble.\par \par \uc2 A more modern communication system, something like Slack or HipChat, could still be hacked, but would have allowed for a central administrator to set an archiving policy. After a few days or weeks, this sort of conversation would have been erased. That's less practical for email, which by its very nature is decentralized. Once you send an email, your thread resides on every device that every recipient ever downloaded it on.\par \par \uc2 Better still, an app like Signal, which encrypts its messages (and which the campaign is now reported to be using), would have made cracking the messages more difficult in the first place.\par \par \uc2 But there's something even more pernicious than weak security here. The deeper problem with email is that it has never quite settled on a social mode. An email can be as formal as a legal letter or as tossed off as drive-by insult. This invites confusion. For instance, in context, Ms. Palmieri's ''Take the money!!'' doesn't sound so bad -- it looks like a quick, half-cheeky way to end an overlong discussion. If it were said on a phone call or an instant message, ''Take the money'' would have sounded like an entirely normal way to end the conversation.\par \par \uc2 But email comes with no expectations. Because everything else in the thread sounds serious, Ms. Palmieri's ending line can easily be colored as more sinister.\par \par \uc2 Finally, it's worth noting how much time and how many emails -- more than a dozen -- it took the group to arrive at its decisions. Email sometimes tricks us into feeling efficient, but it rarely is. Because it's asynchronous, and because there are no limits on space and time, it often leads to endless, pointless ruminations. If they had ditched email and just held a 15-minute meeting, members of the campaign could have hashed out the foreign-agent decision more quickly in private.\par \par \uc2 In other words, limits often help. Get on the phone, make a decision, ditch your inbox. The world will be better off for it.\par \par \uc2 DRAWING (DRAWING BY DOUG CHAYKA) (B7) \par \par \uc2 Document NYTF000020161020ecak00067\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 DO you know a logical fallacy from a statistical improbability? Do you know correlations from causations?\par \par \uc2 This year's presidential \uc2 election\uc2  is full of facts, figures and arguments spouted by the candidates, pundits and many others. To sort through all the noise, there are apps to help you understand logic and basic math, which may well be worth brushing up on before casting your vote.\par \par \uc2 The Illustrated Book of Bad Arguments is an excellent starting point. The app mimics the interactive book of the same name that contains a glossary of the false arguments or logical fallacies that are sometimes made by politicians.\par \par \uc2 Take, for example, the appeal to fear: A speaker plays on emotions and fears by suggesting that a terrible future may happen if situation X or Y occurs or does not occur. The app gives examples of this technique, so you can spot it in use on TV, online or in print. The illustrations that go along with each argument are amusing and informative.\par \par \uc2 The Bad Arguments app is free and available only on iOS. It has not been updated in a while, so its performance may vary depending on your mobile device. But it is the kind of app you could use with older children to help them understand political arguments.\par \par \uc2 Another iOS app explains these sorts of issues in an even simpler format. Fallacies of Logic lists over 100 different fallacious arguments, describing each in a paragraph or two. It includes examples (like ignoring the question, false analogy and personal attack) and a search feature. Though not as pretty or as interesting as Bad Arguments, it gets the job done.\par \par \uc2 Android users have a useful alternative in Rhetological Fallacies. This free app explains logical fallacies in short sentences and with very brief examples. It is easy to read, and useful for arming yourself against the next piece of political spin.\par \par \uc2 If I said that two in three statistics have a 10 percent chance of being made up, would you believe me? As this nonsensical statement shows, statistics can be tricky and easy to manipulate. To make sure you're not taken in by statistical trickery in a political speech, you could spend an hour or two checking out Learn Statistics by GoLearningBus, which is free on iOS and Android.\par \par \uc2 It's designed like a traditional lesson, beginning with the fundamentals and then moving on to more complex ideas. It has quizzes to help check your understanding.\par \par \uc2 But it's dry in terms of design and language, and it assumes you have at least a basic understanding of math. Still, it's useful for those serious about improving their understanding of statistics.\par \par \uc2 As its name suggests, Settle It! from PolitiFacts is meant to help settle the political arguments you may find yourself embroiled in these days. Using logic, genuinely sourced facts and clear explanations, the app tries to unravel whether a political position taken up by a candidate (or by a friend or family member) makes sense. So if Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2  makes an outrageous statement, or \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  is carefree with a fact, you should be able to find out what's what by using this app.\par \par \uc2 You can search for keywords, such as climate change, and the app will show a list of recent political arguments made by public figures on the topic. Tapping on a list entry reveals more, such as which public figures have spoken on the subject and how their arguments compared with the hard facts.\par \par \uc2 There is a trending topics section so you can get up to speed on current issues, and a weekly quiz that tests critical thinking and understanding of the current political debate (note that you have to be very much on top of the news). Settle It! isn't the prettiest in design, but its interface is easy to navigate. It's free for iOS and Android devices.\par \par \uc2 None of these apps can tell you which way to vote, of course -- that is up to you. But do yourself and democracy a favor and apply some of the lessons they teach the next time a presidential candidate makes a point you find questionable.\par \par \uc2 Quick Call\par \par \uc2 ProCam is popular on iOS because it enhances what you can do with the iPhone's camera. Now it has added a feature aimed at iPhone 7 Plus owners: 3-D images. The twin camera units built into the 7 Plus see a scene from slightly different angles, allowing ProCam to create short animated sequences that deliver a 3-D effect for the object you are shooting. ProCam is $5.\par \par \uc2 Instagram\uc2  strangely continues to deny iPad owners a dedicated app. But at least now there's a Windows 10 app for the photo-sharing service that, for tablets or phones that have a rear-facing camera, provides the full set of features. It's free.\par \par \uc2 Settle It!, left, helps make sense of what politicians say. Illustrated Book of Bad Arguments, center, catalogs common fallacies. Learn Statistics teaches the nuances of probability and other topics. \par \par \uc2 Document NYTF000020161020ecak00064\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 Politics; SECT\par \b \uc2 When \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  Tested New Slogans -- 85 of Them\b0\par\par\uc2 By MATT FLEGENHEIMER \par \uc2 746 \uc2 words\par \uc2 20 October 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 The New York Times on the Web\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Crafting the perfect political slogan is hard. Writing scores of unmemorable ones? Less so.\par \par \uc2 Buried in the leaked emails of \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's campaign chairman, \uc2 John D. Podesta\uc2 , is a message from August 2015, when the campaign was weighing a list of prospective slogans for Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's candidacy. Some ring familiar:\par \par \uc2 \u226\'00\'E2\u8211\'20\'13\u160\'00\'A0Progress for the rest of us. Not quite a ''Festivus for the rest of us,'' in ''Seinfeld'' parlance, but in the ballpark.\par \par \uc2 \u226\'00\'E2\u8211\'20\'13\u160\'00\'A0Building a better tomorrow. Does not appear to have the blessing of Stephen Colbert's former ''super PAC'' -- ''Americans for a Better Tomorrow, Tomorrow.''\par \par \uc2 \u226\'00\'E2\u8211\'20\'13\u160\'00\'A0Go further. A rallying cry on which a Ford branding effort was once premised.\par \par \uc2 \u226\'00\'E2\u8211\'20\'13\u160\'00\'A0Renewing our basic bargain. Calls to mind the stay-the-course-but-not-entirely ethos of Selina Meyer on ''Veep.'' (Her slogan: ''Continuity with change.'')\par \par \uc2 Then there is the final section of the email, under the themed heading ''It's about you,'' which -- taken as a whole -- reads as its own sort of inspirational pop-song stanza.\par \par \uc2 It's about you. It's about time\par \par \uc2 It's about time ... and it's about you.\par \par \uc2 It's about you.\par \par \uc2 Because your time is now\par \par \uc2 It's your turn\par \par \uc2 It's your time\par \par \uc2 It's your time\par \par \uc2 Next begins with you\par \par \uc2 During the Democratic primary, Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's campaign cycled through several taglines -- ''Breaking down barriers''; ''Everyday Americans need a champion''; ''Fighting for us''; ''Building ladders of opportunity'' -- betraying a restlessness with its options.\par \par \uc2 The list from the leaked email does include the campaign's general \uc2 election\uc2  choice, ''Stronger Together'' -- as well as a slightly wordier variation, ''Together we're strong.''\par \par \uc2 Here is the full collection, broken into eight categories in the initial email:\par \par \uc2 Theme: Fairness/Families\par \par \uc2 A fair shot and a fair deal\par \par \uc2 Hillary -- For Fairness.

\par\par \uc2 THE MODERATOR\par \uc2 National Desk; SECTA\par \b \uc2 Mixing Humor With Scolding to Defuse Clashes in a Final Substantive Encounter\b0\par\par\uc2 By MICHAEL M. GRYNBAUM \par \uc2 950 \uc2 words\par \uc2 20 October 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 17\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 LAS VEGAS -- The smart money on Wednesday's matchup between \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  and \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2  was for a 12-round, no-holds-barred bout worthy of this city's prizefights.\par \par \uc2 But Chris Wallace wanted a debate. And for the most part, he got one.\par \par \uc2 The first Fox News journalist chosen to moderate a general-\uc2 election\uc2  debate, Mr. Wallace mixed humor with scolding and persistence with patience to guide his charges toward the most substantive encounter of an unusually vicious \uc2 election\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Mr. Wallace's watchword for the evening, it seemed, was ''defuse'': He posed detailed questions on policy, opened the proceedings with a calm query about Supreme Court jurisprudence and kept an eyebrow firmly arched as Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , and more often, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , attempted to talk over him.\par \par \uc2 ''I'm not a potted plant here,'' Mr. Wallace said at one point, prompting laughter in the audience, when the candidates' bickering threatened to drown him out. ''I do get to ask some questions.''\par \par \uc2 Inevitable clashes and interjections left Mr. Wallace at times yelping, ''Excuse me! Excuse me!'' from his desk.\par \par \uc2 And while Mr. Wallace, dapper with his trademark pocket square, maintained a genteel presence, he also issued some sharply phrased questions that were sure to irk his skeptics, especially \uc2 Clinton\uc2  supporters already leery of a Fox News anchor taking the reins.\par \par \uc2 One query to Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  began with an adversarial clause -- ''In a speech you gave to a Brazilian bank, for which you were paid $225,000'' -- that earned an onstage ''thank you'' from Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , who has clashed with other moderators. (Mr. Wallace did not roll his eyes at Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , but his bemused expression came close.)\par \par \uc2 Later, he asserted that the Obama stimulus package ''led to'' slow economic growth, earning rebukes on \uc2 Twitter\uc2  from liberals. ''Wallace is being tough on both of them, but he framed his questions from a conservative Fox News viewpoint,'' wrote Dan Pfeiffer, a former Obama adviser.\par \par \uc2 But Mr. Wallace, a battle-tested political interrogator with a classic newsman's baritone, did not hesitate to confront Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 . He pressed the candidate about the costs of his economic plan, his praise of Russia and his treatment of women, asking why ''so many different women, from so many different circumstances,'' had accused him of sexual misconduct.\par \par \uc2 And in the night's most memorable exchange, Mr. Wallace repeatedly challenged Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  to pledge that he would not contest the \uc2 election\uc2  results if he were to lose, noting that ''a tradition in this country -- in fact, one of the prides of this country is the peaceful transition of power.'' Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's defiant reply: ''I will keep you in suspense.''\par \par \uc2 Mr. Wallace's demeanor came across as less aggressive than the interviewing style adopted by Anderson Cooper of \uc2 CNN\uc2  and Martha Raddatz of ABC News in last week's debate, which also earned praise.\par \par \uc2 But his subtle yet firm approach felt designed to elevate the \uc2 election\uc2  season and invoke the broader civic consequences at stake. And it generated a debate that put the candidates' substantive and stylistic contrasts on full display.\par \par \uc2 ''Chris Wallace is the real winner of this debate,'' Meghan McCain, daughter of Senator \uc2 John McCain\uc2 , wrote on \uc2 Twitter\uc2  on Wednesday night, echoing admiration from a range of conservatives and liberals alike.\par \par \uc2 The candidates were not the only factor Mr. Wallace had to worry about when he walked into the arena here on Wednesday. His presence was a milestone for Fox News, whose news division has long struggled for mainstream recognition.\par \par \uc2 Some liberals worried he could carry conservative bias onto the stage. Mr. Wallace also took heat for saying he did not plan to aggressively fact-check the candidates, preferring that they questioned each other.\par \par \uc2 But close watchers of all political stripes say that if Mr. Wallace has a bias, it is toward making mischief. Mr. Wallace, who turned 69 last week, is a proud contrarian, whose reportorial impertinence has resulted in some memorable lines: \uc2 Bill \uc2 Clinton\uc2  once accused him of having a ''little smirk on your face'' during a televised interview.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Wallace interviewed scores of politicians for ABC and \uc2 NBC\uc2  before joining Fox in 2003. Often cited as the network's moderate voice, he brings a gimlet-eyed disposition to his work. When Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , in an interview earlier this year, pledged to act more presidential, Mr. Wallace did not miss a beat. ''When are you going to start?'' he replied.\par \par \uc2 At this year's primary debates, Mr. Wallace wielded PowerPoint slides in challenging candidates, telling Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  that his proposed budget numbers ''don't add up.'' In an interview with Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , he read back blunt criticism from the F.B.I. director about her use of a private email server when the candidate tried to evade a question.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Wallace's big moment on Wednesday also has a personal side: He is the son of Mike Wallace, the renowned broadcast correspondent who died in 2012, and their relationship was complicated. Speaking on ''Fox News Sunday'' about this debate, Mr. Wallace quipped that if his father were alive, ''he'd try to steal it from me.''\par \par \uc2 It was a joke, sort of. Mike Wallace did once steal an interview from his son -- with the comedian Chris Rock, a less consequential occasion than the final presidential debate.\par \par \uc2 Find out what you need to know about the 2016 presidential race today, and get politics news updates via \uc2 Facebook\uc2 , \uc2 Twitter\uc2  and the First Draft newsletter.\par \par \uc2 Chris Wallace was the first Fox News journalist chosen to moderate a general-\uc2 election\uc2  debate.

It was also a three-week period in which cities in at least 34 states reported record-high temperatures. New York reached 80 degrees today, and Nashville nearly hit 90.\par \par \uc2 This year is all but guaranteed to be the planet's hottest on record, just as 2015 and 2014 were. The damage from climate change is now speeding up.\par \par \uc2 And how many questions were \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2 , Tim Kaine and \uc2 Mike Pence\uc2  asked about climate change over the six hours of their four combined debates?\par \par \uc2 Zero.\par \par \uc2 The closest was a question from a town hall participant, who asked how the country could have an energy policy that was both environmentally friendly while also ''minimizing job loss for fossil power plant workers.''\par \par \uc2 The failure to ask about climate change is a failure of journalism. I thought that the debate moderators had some very fine moments over the last few weeks, calmly drawing out the candidates. But the lack of a single question on the world's biggest problem was a grievous error.\par \par \uc2 The moderators asked about a lot of other serious issues: Syria, Russia, terrorism, tax policy, health care and the Supreme Court. They also asked about \uc2 Trump\uc2 's early morning tweets and about \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's and \uc2 Trump\uc2 's favorability ratings. Somehow, amid all of that, climate change didn't make the cut.\par \par \uc2 This article is part of the Opinion Today newsletter.

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 PRAGUE -- A man identified as a Russian hacker suspected of pursuing targets in the United States has been arrested in the Czech Republic, the police announced Tuesday evening.\par \par \uc2 The suspect was captured in a raid at a hotel in central Prague on Oct. 5, about 12 hours after the authorities heard that he was in the country, where he drove around in a luxury car with his girlfriend, according to the police. The man did not resist arrest, but he had medical problems and was briefly hospitalized, the police said in a statement.\par \par \uc2 David Sch\u246\'00\'F6n, a police spokesman, said on Wednesday that the arrest of the man, whose name has not been released, was not announced immediately ''for tactical reasons.''\par \par \uc2 The police statement said that ''the man was a Russian citizen suspected of hacking attacks on targets in the United States,'' and that the raid was conducted in collaboration with the F.B.I. after \uc2 Interpol\uc2  issued an arrest warrant for him.\par \par \uc2 The social media company \uc2 LinkedIn\uc2  said it believed it had been a victim in the case. The company, which acts as a virtual job network, said it had been actively involved in the F.B.I.'s case since it was hacked in 2012.\par \par \uc2 The F.B.I. said in a statement that the arrest was an example of the collaboration needed ''to successfully defeat cyber adversaries,'' but declined to provide any further details.\par \par \uc2 The arrest occurred two days before the Obama administration formally accused the Russian government of stealing and disclosing emails from the \uc2 Democratic National Committee\uc2  and other institutions and prominent individuals.\par \par \uc2 But law enforcement officials in Washington, speaking on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to comment while the investigation was underway, said Wednesday that the suspect did not appear to be related to the hacking of the Democrats' emails or to organizations like DCLeaks or \uc2 WikiLeaks\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 A judge in Prague has ordered the man to remain in custody, and a court will examine whether to extradite him to the United States.\par \par \uc2 The Russian Embassy in Prague called for the man to be released.\par \par \uc2 ''We insist that the detained Russian citizen should be transferred to Russia,'' the state-run Russian news agency Tass quoted Aleksei Kolmakov, the embassy's spokesman, as saying.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Kolmakov said that the embassy had been notified about the detention, but that the Kremlin's spokesman, Dmitri S. Peskov, had told the news website RBK that it did not have details about the man's identity.\par \par \uc2 Jakub Janda, who studies the Russian government and is a deputy director of the European Values Think-Tank in Prague, said that the arrest served as confirmation that ''the Czech Republic is so far considered a safe base for Russian intelligence and influence activities focused on Western targets.''\par \par \uc2 He added, ''Prague is unofficially considered to be a springboard for some Kremlin activities inside Europe, also using huge Russian diplomatic presence of approximately 140 staff.''\par \par \uc2 Mr. Janda also said that the arrest showed that ''Western governments are waking up and finally considering hostile Russian intelligence and disinformation operations to be an open and urgent threat, even at the level of the U.S. administration.''\par \par \uc2 He added, ''Open arrests of hostile individuals such as this one can serve as a deterrent element.''\par \par \uc2 The United States director of national intelligence, James R. Clapper Jr., said in a statement on Oct. 7 that high-level Russian officials were trying to interfere with American elections.\par \par \uc2 ''The recent disclosures of alleged hacked emails on sites like DCLeaks.com and \uc2 WikiLeaks\uc2  and by the Guccifer 2.0 online persona are consistent with the methods and motivations of Russian-directed efforts,'' Mr. Clapper said. ''These thefts and disclosures are intended to interfere with the U.S. \uc2 election\uc2  process.''\par \par \uc2 The antisecrecy organizations DCLeaks and \uc2 WikiLeaks\uc2  have been involved with the disclosures of illegally obtained emails from the hacked accounts of prominent figures including Colin L. Powell, the former secretary of state, and \uc2 John D. Podesta\uc2 , the chairman of \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's presidential campaign. Guccifer 2.0 is the assumed name of a Romanian ''lone hacker'' responsible for copying thousands of emails and other files from the Democratic committee, but experts are not certain if the hacker is a person or a front created by Russian intelligence officials.\par \par \uc2 It appears that the man arrested in Prague is not related to the hackers Mr. Clapper described.\par \par \uc2 This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.\par \par \uc2 Document NYTF000020161020ecak0004r\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 WASHINGTON -- Until just a few months ago, \uc2 Evan Bayh\uc2  was working for the \uc2 U.S. Chamber of Commerce\uc2 . Now the chamber is working as hard as it can against him.\par \par \uc2 In a campaign twist with significance in the battle for the Senate, the nation's leading business lobby is going all out to defeat Mr. Bayh, the former Democratic senator from Indiana trying to reclaim his old seat. The chamber is doing so despite the fact that Mr. Bayh, considered a business-friendly centrist, was on the chamber payroll as recently as June and made appearances on the organization's behalf after leaving the Senate in 2011.\par \par \uc2 The chamber's decision to attack its former ally has angered Senate Democrats to no end because capturing the Indiana seat is a crucial element of their plan to take back the Senate majority. Democrats' efforts to persuade the chamber to stay out of the race as a demonstration of bipartisanship were rebuffed. The result has strained ties with Democrats, who might be chilly to future overtures from the chamber, particularly if they are running the Senate.\par \par \uc2 ''The fact that the U.S. Chamber has spent millions against \uc2 Evan Bayh\uc2 , a pro-business candidate who has even served on some of their advisory boards, rips away any pretense of bipartisanship,'' Senator \uc2 Chuck Schumer\uc2  of New York, in line to be Democratic leader, said in a statement. ''The national headquarters is a totally partisan place and has dramatically hurt their ability to work with our caucus in 2017.''\par \par \uc2 Chamber officials say it is Democrats who have moved away from them over the years, embracing policies that make it more difficult for the chamber to support them.\par \par \uc2 In Mr. Bayh's case, chamber officials say, it is strictly a numbers game, noting that he compiled a failing 55 percent voting record on chamber issues during his Senate tenure while Representative Todd Young, his Republican challenger, has a 91 percent rating. A 70 percent or better score is necessary for a chamber endorsement, and the group has seen the number of qualifying Democrats shrink in recent \uc2 election\uc2  cycles.\par \par \uc2 ''If Mr. Schumer believes that a middle-of-the-road F is pro-business, he is wrong, and Hoosiers will have a fundamentally different view,'' said \uc2 Rob Engstrom\uc2 , a senior vice president and the national political director for the chamber.\par \par \uc2 For Mr. Bayh, the chamber's move is a disappointment that illustrates what is wrong with Washington.\par \par \uc2 ''I was disappointed to see the U.S. Chamber putting partisan politics over a longstanding relationship,'' Mr. Bayh said in a statement issued by his campaign. ''I was pleased to work with the chamber for many years and have actually agreed with them on several important issues. Their decision reflects just how polarized and partisan Washington has become.''\par \par \uc2 Beginning in 2011, Mr. Bayh was a spokesman for the chamber on the perceived dangers of government over-regulation. The chamber would not disclose how much he was paid.\par \par \uc2 Now, Mr. Bayh is in an unusual squeeze. Republicans are attacking him for a post-Senate career that included lucrative consulting and corporate roles -- a record they say shows Mr. Bayh has forsaken his Hoosier roots. At the same time, he is under attack from the organization that is the very embodiment of business interests only months after being on its payroll.\par \par \uc2 The chamber has hit Mr. Bayh with ads critical of his support for the new health care law when he was a member of the Senate.\par \par \uc2 The Indiana race is unique in this cycle. Until Mr. Bayh, also a former governor and the son of a popular former senator, decided to run, it was safely assumed to be in the Republican column and not part of the chess match that would decide Senate control.\par \par \uc2 But polling showed that Mr. Bayh, who was sitting on about $10 million in unused campaign cash, remained extremely popular in the state and had a commanding edge even when potential voters were told about his corporate work in Washington.\par \par \uc2 Suddenly faced with the danger of losing a sure seat, Republicans quickly mounted a campaign against Mr. Bayh and focused on his lack of connection to the state in recent years to keep him from gliding to \uc2 election\uc2  after a six-year absence.\par \par \uc2 ''It isn't going to be as easy as he thinks it is,'' Senator Mitch McConnell, the Kentucky Republican and majority leader, told me this summer, referring to Mr. Bayh. ''We are going to go after him.''\par \par \uc2 In contrast to Midwestern states like Illinois and Wisconsin, where Republicans are on defense at least partly because of public rejection of \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , the Republican presidential nominee is not as much of an anchor in Indiana, a state he is likely to carry next month. That political dynamic provided an opportunity for the chamber to help Republicans hold the Senate even if meant taking on a man who had so recently been considered a partner.\par \par \uc2 The chamber finds itself in turbulent political waters these days. On some major issues such as immigration reform, the \uc2 Export-Import Bank\uc2  and infrastructure spending, the business lobby is aligned more with Democrats than Republicans.\par \par \uc2 At the same time, some conservative groups and Republican lawmakers have broken sharply with the chamber, portraying the organization as a greedy advocate of crony capitalism eager for a government handout.\par \par \uc2 Still, the chamber, with its fundamental focus on keeping both government regulation and taxes low, tends to favor Republicans over Democrats, as Mr. Bayh so abruptly found out.\par \par \uc2 It was also new proof of the adage often, and probably inaccurately, attributed to President Harry S. Truman: If you want a friend in Washington, get a dog.\par \par \uc2 Follow The \uc2 New York Times\uc2 's politics and Washington coverage on \uc2 Facebook\uc2  and \uc2 Twitter\uc2 , and sign up for the First Draft politics newsletter.\par \par \uc2 Evan Bayh, the Democratic candidate for Senate in Indiana, was on the U.S. Chamber of Commerce payroll as recently as June.

Contractors Schemed to Incite Chaos at \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  Rallies\b0\par\par\uc2 By ALAN RAPPEPORT \par \uc2 726 \uc2 words\par \uc2 20 October 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 The New York Times on the Web\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Two operatives who were working with the \uc2 Democratic National Committee\uc2  to help elect \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  are no longer working in that role after an undercover video appeared to show them plotting to incite violence at \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's rallies.\par \par \uc2 The creatively edited video (which contains profane language) was the work of James O'Keefe's Project Veritas Action, a right-wing organization that sends researchers around the country to spy on the inner workings of Democratic campaigns. The tape showed Robert Creamer, of Democracy Partners, and Scott Foval, formerly of People for the American Way and Americans United for Change, appearing to talk about plans to plant people outside of \uc2 Trump\uc2  rallies and instigate fights.\par \par \uc2 ''It doesn't matter what the friggin' legal and ethics people say, we need to win this,'' Mr. Foval said in one clip of the video that describes how to get Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's supporters to start punching the people that they plant in line at his rallies.\par \par \uc2 Violence at Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's rallies was widespread over the summer, as Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  was widely blamed for riling up his fans with bombastic language. At one point, he promised to pay the legal fees of supporters who roughed up protesters.\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 Democratic National Committee\uc2  said in a statement that it contracted Mr. Creamer in June 2016 to do counterprogramming in cities where the \uc2 Trump\uc2  campaign was holding events. While the committee said it opposed the incitement of violence of any kind, it was also investigating any potential illegal activity by Mr. O'Keefe.\par \par \uc2 ''The practices described in the video by this temporary regional subcontractor do not in any way comport with our longstanding policies on organizing events, and those statements and sentiments do not represent the values that the committee holds dear,'' Donna Brazile, the interim chairwoman of the D.N.C., said in a statement. ''We do not believe, or have any evidence to suggest, that the activities articulated in the video actually occurred.''\par \par \uc2 Mr. Creamer, who was portrayed by the narrator in the video as the ''diabolical'' mastermind of a team of Democratic consultants, said that Mr. Foval was no longer working with him and that he was stepping away from the campaign to avoid being a distraction.\par \par \uc2 ''We regret the unprofessional and careless hypothetical conversations that were captured on hidden cameras of a temporary regional contractor for our firm, and he is no longer working with us,'' said Mr. Creamer, who is not seen on tape endorsing the plans to create chaos. ''While none of the schemes described in the conversations ever took place, these conversations do not at all reflect the values of Democracy Partners.''\par \par \uc2 Mr. Foval could not be reached for comment.\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 Clinton\uc2  campaign denounced the tactics discussed in the video while expressing doubts about the measures employed by Mr. O'Keefe.\par \par \uc2 ''While Project Veritas has been known to offer misleading video out of context, some of the language and tactics referenced in the video are troubling even as a theory or proposal never executed,'' said Zac Petkanas, a spokesman for Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 . ''We support the \uc2 Democratic National Committee\uc2 's appropriate action addressing this matter and look forward to continue waging a campaign of ideas worthy of our democratic process.''\par \par \uc2 Mr. O'Keefe's organization put campaigns on notice last year that his investigators, who he considers to be journalists, would be aggressively working to infiltrate their operations this \uc2 election\uc2  cycle.\par \par \uc2 While Mr. O'Keefe has been a thorn in the side of campaigns over the years, he has also had legal problems of his own.\par \par \uc2 In 2010, Mr. O'Keefe pleaded guilty to misdemeanor charges and was fined for posing as a repairman to gain access to the office of former Senator Mary Landrieu of Louisiana. Three years ago, Mr. O'Keefe paid $100,000 to settle a lawsuit filed by a former Acorn member after he posed as a pimp during an investigation of the activist group.\par \par \uc2 In his latest video, Mr. O'Keefe said that he planned to release more damaging evidence of wrongdoing before the \uc2 election\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Find out what you need to know about the 2016 presidential race today, and get politics news updates via \uc2 Facebook\uc2 , \uc2 Twitter\uc2  and the First Draft newsletter.\par \par \uc2 Document NYTF000020161020ecak0004j\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 National Desk; SECTA\par \b \uc2 Trump\uc2  Won't Say If He Will Accept \uc2 Election\uc2 's Result\b0\par\par\uc2 By PATRICK HEALY and JONATHAN MARTIN \par \uc2 1,914 \uc2 words\par \uc2 20 October 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 1\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 In a remarkable statement that seemed to cast doubt on American democracy, \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2  said Wednesday that he might not accept the results of next month's \uc2 election\uc2  if he felt it was rigged against him -- a stand that \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  blasted as ''horrifying'' at their final and caustic debate on Wednesday.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , under enormous pressure to halt Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's steady rise in opinion polls, came across as repeatedly frustrated as he tried to rally conservative voters with hard-line stands on illegal immigration and abortion rights. But he kept finding himself drawn onto perilous political territory by Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  and the debate's moderator, Chris Wallace.\par \par \uc2 He sputtered when Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  charged that he would be ''a puppet'' of President \uc2 Vladimir V. Putin\uc2  of Russia if elected. He lashed out repeatedly, saying that ''she's been proven to be a liar on so many different ways'' and that ''she's guilty of a very, very serious crime'' over her State Department email practices. And by the end of the debate, when Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  needled him over Social Security, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  snapped and said, ''Such a nasty woman.''\par \par \uc2 Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  was repeatedly forced to defend her long service in government, which Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  charged had yielded no real accomplishments. But she was rarely rattled, and made a determined effort to rise above Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's taunts while making overtures to undecided voters.\par \par \uc2 She particularly sought to appeal to Republicans and independents who have doubts about Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , arguing that she was not an opponent of the Second Amendment as he claimed, and promising to be tougher and shrewder on national security than Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 But it was Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's remark about the \uc2 election\uc2  results that stood out, even in a race that has been full of astonishing moments.\par \par \uc2 Every losing presidential candidate in modern times has accepted the will of the voters, even in extraordinarily close races, such as when John F. Kennedy narrowly defeated Richard M. Nixon in 1960 and George W. Bush beat Al Gore in Florida to win the presidency in 2000.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  insisted, without offering evidence, that the general \uc2 election\uc2  has been rigged against him, and he twice refused to say that he would accept its result.\par \par \uc2 ''I will look at it at the time,'' Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  said. ''I will keep you in suspense.''\par \par \uc2 ''That's horrifying,'' Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  replied. ''Let's be clear about what he is saying and what that means. He is denigrating -- he is talking down our democracy. And I am appalled that someone who is the nominee of one of our two major parties would take that position.''\par \par \uc2 Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  then ticked off the number of times he had deemed a system rigged when he suffered a setback, noting he had even called the Emmy Awards fixed when his show, ''The Apprentice,'' was passed over.\par \par \uc2 ''It's funny, but it's also really troubling,'' she said. ''That is not the way our democracy works.''\par \par \uc2 Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  also accused Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  of extreme coziness with Mr. Putin, criticizing him for failing to condemn Russian espionage against her campaign's internal email.\par \par \uc2 When Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  responded that Mr. Putin had ''no respect'' for Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , she shot back, in one of the toughest lines of the night: ''That's because he'd rather have a puppet as president of the United States.''\par \par \uc2 ''No puppet, no puppet,'' Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  sputtered. ''You're the puppet.'' He quickly recovered and said, ''She has been outsmarted and outplayed worse than anybody I've ever seen in any government, whatsoever.''\par \par \uc2 With 20 days left before \uc2 Election\uc2  Day and early voting already underway in Florida, Ohio and several other key states, the debate felt less like an argument between equals than a last-ditch attempt by a fading candidate, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , to save himself.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  sought throughout the debate to recover from a politically damaging three weeks. He has been unable to gain traction in the polls from his strategy of assailing the Clintons as corrupt and immoral; the news media as biased and bent on rigging the \uc2 election\uc2  against him; and the nine women who have come forward to accuse him of unwanted sexual advances as liars and, in some cases, unattractive.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  said, in response to a question from the debate moderator, Chris Wallace of Fox News, that the claims of the women had been ''debunked'' and that they had been put forward by Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's campaign.\par \par \uc2 But after he denied ridiculing the looks of the women accusing him of sexual harassment -- ''I did not say that,'' he repeated three times -- Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  repeated nearly verbatim his two comments from last week about the appearances of a pair of his accusers.\par \par \uc2 ''Donald thinks belittling women makes him bigger,'' she said. ''He goes after their dignity, their self-worth; and I don't think there is a woman anywhere who doesn't know what that feels like.''\par \par \uc2 After Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  finished an extended condemnation, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  said only: ''Nobody has more respect for women than I do, nobody.''\par \par \uc2 In contrast to their two previous debates, the 90-minute discussion covered significant substantive ground. On immigration, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  argued that Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  wanted to give illegal immigrants ''amnesty'' and that ''she wants to have open borders.''\par \par \uc2 ''We have to have strong borders, we have to keep the drugs out of our country -- right now we're getting the drugs, they're getting the cash,'' he added. ''We have some bad hombres here, and we're going to get them out.''\par \par \uc2 Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  recalled meeting a young girl in Las Vegas whose parents had been threatened, and noted that Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  has said that every illegal immigrant would ultimately be subject to deportation.\par \par \uc2 ''I don't want to rip families apart,'' Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  said. ''I don't want to see the deportation force that Donald has talked about in action in our country.''\par \par \uc2 At several points, Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  tried to bait Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  into an outburst, such as when she said that he ''choked'' during his meeting this summer with the president of Mexico when he did not press him on Mexico paying to build a border wall.\par \par \uc2 But Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  pivoted to attack former President Bill \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's administration for supporting the \uc2 North American Free Trade Agreement\uc2  and assailed Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  for her past comments supporting ''open borders'' in the Western Hemisphere.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  also called the \uc2 Clinton\uc2  Foundation\uc2  ''a criminal enterprise.'' Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  returned fire by ridiculing Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's foundation, which she noted purchased ''a six-foot portrait of Donald.''\par \par \uc2 ''I mean, who does that?'' she asked.\par \par \uc2 The two candidates also tangled over abortion rights. After initially declining to flatly say whether he would support overturning Roe v. Wade, the 1973 Supreme Court decision that legalized abortion, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  conceded that the justices he would appoint to the court would do just that.\par \par \uc2 ''If we put another two or perhaps three justices on, that's really what will happen,'' he said. ''That'll happen automatically in my opinion.''\par \par \uc2 Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  responded with a full-throated defense of Roe and abortion rights.\par \par \uc2 ''The government has no business in the decisions that women make,'' she said.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  retorted, ''If you go with what Hillary is saying, in the ninth month you can take the baby and rip the baby out of the womb of the mother just prior to the birth of the baby.''\par \par \uc2 Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  appeared visibly angry. ''You should meet with some of the women I've met with,'' she said, accusing him of using ''scare rhetoric.''\par \par \uc2 Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  used the opening question about the Supreme Court to make a broad appeal to voters to consider the future of the United States under her presidency or a \uc2 Trump\uc2  administration. ''What kind of country are we going to be? What kind of opportunities are we going to provide for our citizens, what kind of rights will Americans have?''\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  asserted that if Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  won, the Second Amendment would become ''a very, very small replica of what we have now.'' He also said he would appoint justices who ''will interpret the Constitution the way the founders want it interpreted.''\par \par \uc2 Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  quickly tried to undercut Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  on guns.\par \par \uc2 ''I support the Second Amendment,'' she said, noting that she had lived in Arkansas and represented upstate New York where many gun owners lived. ''When I think about what I need to do, we have 33,000 people a year who die from guns. I think we need comprehensive background checks'' and to close loopholes that make it easier for Americans to buy guns.\par \par \uc2 On the economy, Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  described Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  as a hypocrite, accusing him of crying ''crocodile tears'' over manufacturers moving abroad while noting that he uses foreign steel for his hotel in Las Vegas.\par \par \uc2 That prompted a ferocious counterattack from Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , demanding why she had not done more to improve the economy during her years in public life.\par \par \uc2 ''Why the hell didn't you do it over the last 15 or 20 years,'' he demanded, adding: ''The one thing you have over me is experience, but it's bad experience.''\par \par \uc2 Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , clearly prepared for him to return to this line of attack, responded with a carefully prepared salvo.\par \par \uc2 She compared what the two of them had been doing since the 1970s, highlighting her public service accomplishments and ridiculing him for borrowing money from his father, mocking a beauty queen as ''an eating machine'' and hosting a reality television show.\par \par \uc2 ''On the day when I was in the Situation Room, monitoring the raid that brought Osama bin Laden to justice, he was hosting ''The Celebrity Apprentice,''' Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  said.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  defended himself by boasting about his business success and said the country would be well served if it was run in the fashion of his company.\par \par \uc2 Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , reaching for not just a win but a mandate, made both direct and more subtle appeals to Republican voters. She noted that in the 1980s Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  had criticized Ronald Reagan over his stewardship, twice invoking the name of the late president revered by so many Republicans.\par \par \uc2 Remarkably, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  demanded additional time to speak so he could note that he did, in fact, disagree with Reagan over trade. Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , in that moment, came off as more respectful to Republican history.\par \par \uc2 ''I would like to say to everyone watching tonight that I'm reaching out to all Americans, Democrats, Republicans and independents,'' she said, ''because we need everybody to help make our country what it should be.''\par \par \uc2 Find out what you need to know about the 2016 presidential race today, and get politics news updates via \uc2 Facebook\uc2 , \uc2 Twitter\uc2  and the First Draft newsletter.\par \par \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2  and Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  met Wednesday night at the University of Nevada-Las Vegas for their third and last debate.

\par\par \uc2 OP-ED COLUMNIST\par \uc2 Editorial Desk; SECTA\par \b \uc2 The Debate in One Scary Answer\b0\par\par\uc2 By GAIL COLLINS \par \uc2 903 \uc2 words\par \uc2 20 October 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 27\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 O.K., \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  won't promise to accept the results of the \uc2 election\uc2 . That's truly ... good grief.\par \par \uc2 ''I will tell you at the time. ... I'll keep you in suspense,'' he told Wednesday's debate moderator, Chris Wallace. The word ''rigged'' came up. Yow.\par \par \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  noted that \uc2 Trump\uc2  tends to presume that whenever he loses anything, the system was rigged: ''There was even a time when he didn't get an Emmy for his TV program three years in a row and he started tweeting that the Emmys were rigged.''\par \par \uc2 ''I should have gotten it,'' \uc2 Trump\uc2  retorted.\par \par \uc2 This is obviously what we should have known was coming when the host of ''The Celebrity Apprentice'' wound up as a presidential nominee. But jeepers, people, this is serious. \uc2 Trump\uc2  was refusing to acknowledge it was even possible for him to lose a fair fight. At one point, he announced the \uc2 election\uc2  was rigged because \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  was in it. (''She should never have been allowed to run for the presidency based on what she did with emails.'')\par \par \uc2 The rigged-\uc2 election\uc2  moment overshadowed everything else in the debate, during which \uc2 Trump\uc2  made very strange faces while \uc2 Clinton\uc2  was talking, but did manage to avoid going completely off the rails. Does that make him a success? We are once again faced with the problem of the very, very low bar. Still, no.\par \par \uc2 He did manage, particularly in the early part of the debate, to ignore \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's effort to get his goat. When she claimed he ''choked'' at his meeting with the president of Mexico, he kept pretty calm. Although \uc2 Trump\uc2  did observe, weirdly, that when it came to immigration, under President Obama ''millions of people have been moved out of this country. ... She doesn't want to say that, but that's what's happened ... big league.'' Is moving people out not the whole \uc2 Trump\uc2  plan?\par \par \uc2 They also had a whopping argument about -- guess who? \uc2 Vladimir Putin\uc2 ! ''Putin from everything I see has no respect for this person,'' \uc2 Trump\uc2  said, referring to \uc2 Clinton\uc2 . The fight went on for a while, until she cannily managed to divert the discussion to the possibility of placing \uc2 Trump\uc2 's ''finger on the nuclear button.''\par \par \uc2 O.K., two critical takeaways. \uc2 Trump\uc2  won't promise to concede if he loses, and if he wins, he gets control of the nukes. These are the only things you need to think about for the next two and a half weeks.\par \par \uc2 We have been down this debate road before, and we knew before the evening started that when \uc2 Trump\uc2  was asked about groping women, he'd deny everything, blame it on \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  and then bring up the emails. And that when the emails came up, \uc2 Clinton\uc2  would mention the way \uc2 Trump\uc2  insulted \uc2 John McCain\uc2 's war record, the Mexican-American judge and the parents of the dead war hero.\par \par \uc2 ''Such a nasty woman,'' \uc2 Trump\uc2  said at one point. As the debate went on, he got more sullen, his expressions stranger. One of the things we have now learned for sure, three debates running, is that he has a serious stamina problem. \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  has many faults. She tends to give long, rather boring answers. She has never learned how to deal with the email question. But the woman is an absolute rock in these long-running, high-stress critical encounters.\par \par \uc2 Also, she made it very clear that she would accept the results of the \uc2 election\uc2 , even if she lost. God help us all.\par \par \uc2 Clinton\uc2  was not particularly good in defending the \uc2 Clinton\uc2  Foundation\uc2 . However, it did seem fair for her to point out that \uc2 Trump\uc2  used some of his own foundation's money to purchase a six-foot portrait of himself. (''Who does that?'')\par \par \uc2 But what difference did it all make? The man wouldn't promise to concede if he loses. Later on \uc2 CNN\uc2 , his campaign manager said \uc2 Trump\uc2  would indeed accept the results ''because he's going to win the \uc2 election\uc2 .'' This was not particularly reassuring.\par \par \uc2 If you were totally ignoring the entire event, you might want to know that nobody shook hands, that it took \uc2 Clinton\uc2  an hour to mention that \uc2 Trump\uc2  had never released his tax returns, and that whenever she pointed out that he had purchased the very same Chinese steel and aluminum he complained was ruining the economy, he said that it was her fault for not changing the laws.\par \par \uc2 She did bring up the Miss-Universe-is-fat moment, and \uc2 Trump\uc2  said ''give me a break.''\par \par \uc2 He promised to run the country ''the way I run my company,'' and a great part of the listening public contemplated the fact that this is a guy who's declared bankruptcy six times. But we've already forgotten all about it.\par \par \uc2 Only one thing matters. The man says he won't promise to accept the results of the \uc2 election\uc2 . All those establishment Republicans who've been hoping to get through this ordeal by just being quiet and looking sad have got some work to do. Fast.\par \par \uc2 I invite you to join me on \uc2 Facebook\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Follow The \uc2 New York Times\uc2  Opinion section on \uc2 Facebook\uc2  and \uc2 Twitter\uc2  (@NYTopinion), and sign up for the Opinion Today newsletter.\par \par \uc2 Nicholas Kristof is off today.\par \par \uc2 This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.\par \par \uc2 Document NYTF000020161020ecak0004c\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 She mansplained him. ''Let me translate that if I can,'' \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  said dryly after \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2  talked up his tax plan.\par \par \uc2 She interrupted him. When Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  boasted of the gilded Las Vegas hotel that bears his name, Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  leaned into her microphone. ''Made with Chinese steel,'' she quipped with a smile.\par \par \uc2 She mocked him. After Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  said President \uc2 Vladimir V. Putin\uc2  of Russia had ''no respect'' for her, Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  slyly posited why Mr. Putin seemingly preferred Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 : ''He'd rather have a puppet as president of the United States,'' she said.\par \par \uc2 In the third and final presidential debate, Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  outmaneuvered Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  with a surprising new approach: his.\par \par \uc2 Flipping the script, she turned herself into his relentless tormentor, condescending to him repeatedly and deploying some of his own trademark tactics against him.\par \par \uc2 The relatively subdued and largely defanged Republican nominee who showed up onstage at the \uc2 University of Nevada, Las Vegas\uc2 , was a different figure from the candidate America has watched for the past 16 months.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  was, for much of the night, oddly calm and composed. He minimized his name-calling. His interruptions were relatively rare for him.\par \par \uc2 In a debate that his allies had predicted would represent 90 minutes of scorched-earth verbal warfare, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  seemed deserted by his most bellicose instincts.\par \par \uc2 He repeatedly gave up chances to respond to pointed taunts from Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , who dominated the confrontation from its opening moments, needling and baiting him over and over.\par \par \uc2 During a back-and-forth about immigration, Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  landed a hard jab, asserting that Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  had used undocumented workers to build \uc2 Trump\uc2  Tower -- even threatening such workers, she said, with deportation.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , who until Wednesday had seldom let a critique go by unanswered, did not respond.\par \par \uc2 In the night's biggest surprise, he allowed Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  to avoid entirely a question from the moderator, Chris Wallace of Fox News, about allegations of sexual misconduct against former President \uc2 Bill \uc2 Clinton\uc2  and what role she might have played in trying to discredit the women who came forward to accuse her husband.\par \par \uc2 At times, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  was inexplicably polite. As he replied to a question about the Second Amendment, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  observed that his rival might have paid him a backhanded compliment by mentioning his endorsement from the \uc2 National Rifle Association\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 ''I don't know if Hillary was saying it in a sarcastic manner,'' he said, with uncharacteristic mildness.\par \par \uc2 At the moments when Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  did revert to his old, familiar self, he seemed unsteady and defensive.\par \par \uc2 When Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  called him a puppet of Mr. Putin, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  offered a limp interruption.\par \par \uc2 ''No puppet. No puppet,'' he said. ''You're the puppet,'' he added, emptily. He never explained what he might have meant.\par \par \uc2 After two historically acrid debates, Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  finally got the policy discussion she had craved. But in between expounding on her proposals to make college affordable and to raise the minimum wage, she savaged Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's career, his finances and his sensitivities, portraying him as a lightweight with the temperament of a spoiled child.\par \par \uc2 On his experience: ''On the day when I was in the Situation Room monitoring the raid that brought Osama bin Laden to justice, he was hosting 'The Celebrity Apprentice,''' Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  said.\par \par \uc2 On his charitable giving, compared with the work of the \uc2 Clinton\uc2  Foundation\uc2 : ''I'd be happy to compare what we do with the \uc2 Trump\uc2  Foundation, which took money from other people and bought a six-foot portrait of Donald,'' Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  said witheringly.\par \par \uc2 ''I mean, who does that?'' she added.\par \par \uc2 On Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's famed negotiating skills: ''He went to Mexico. He had a meeting with the Mexican president,'' Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  said bitingly. ''He choked and then got into a \uc2 Twitter\uc2  war because the Mexican president said, 'We're not paying for that wall.'''\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  struggled to keep pace. ''Excuse me,'' he complained. ''My turn,'' he stomped.\par \par \uc2 ''The one thing you have over me is experience,'' Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  said at one point.\par \par \uc2 And yet it seemed clear through this last confrontation that there was a gap in knowledge, or at least in command of the material that candidates seeking to be president are expected to master.\par \par \uc2 ''Take a look at the Start-Up they signed,'' Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  said at one point, apparently referring to the Start nuclear arms reduction treaty.\par \par \uc2 Pressed on immigration, Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  detailed her plan to overhaul the current system, identifying a daughter of undocumented parents who feared they would be deported. Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's response seemed far less certain: After reiterating his plan to build a wall on the Mexican border, he summoned a line straight out of a Hollywood western. ''We have some bad hombres here, and we're going to get them out,'' he said.\par \par \uc2 Asked about a 2008 Supreme Court decision on gun control, District of Columbia v. Heller, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  displayed a loose command of the subject, focusing his answer on Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's emotions after the ruling. ''Hillary was extremely upset, extremely angry,'' he said.\par \par \uc2 As the debate wore on, Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  kept finding opportunities to make Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  seem smaller and smaller, or at least more puerile.\par \par \uc2 She noted that after a stretch without an Emmy for his reality TV show, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  had claimed that the awards show was rigged against him -- just as he now says about the \uc2 election\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  did not disappoint. ''Should have gotten it,'' he said bitterly.\par \par \uc2 And it became clear that the candidate who relishes his role as a bully had little patience for being bullied.\par \par \uc2 Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  implied that Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  would find a way to weasel out of paying his fair share of taxes for Social Security.\par \par \uc2 ''My Social Security payroll contribution will go up, as will Donald's -- assuming he can't figure out how to get out of it,'' Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  said, fully aware she was provoking him.\par \par \uc2 And provoked he was.\par \par \uc2 ''Such a nasty woman,'' Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  grumbled.\par \par \uc2 Find out what you need to know about the 2016 presidential race today, and get politics news updates via \uc2 Facebook\uc2 , \uc2 Twitter\uc2  and the First Draft newsletter.\par \par \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  shook hands with the moderator, Chris Wallace, on Wednesday before the debate at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, a gesture that was not repeated with Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2 .

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 God's Love We Deliver held its fall gala on Monday night at Spring Studios, but the elephant in the room was the divisive presidential \uc2 election\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Anna Wintour, the night's chairwoman, was among the early arrivals. She posed on the red carpet in her Chanel sunglasses before darting off to a \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  fund-raiser organized by the movie producer Harvey Weinstein and the theater magnate \uc2 Jordan Roth\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 She was followed by the evening's M.C., Neil Patrick Harris, who wore a corduroy Marc Jacobs suit and was planning anti-\uc2 Trump\uc2  remarks.\par \par \uc2 Then came Blaine \uc2 Trump\uc2 , a vice chairwoman of God's Love We Deliver, who was previously married to Robert \uc2 Trump\uc2 , Donald's brother. She attempted, like Switzerland, to remain neutral this \uc2 election\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 But that turns out not to be so easy, even when she was surrounded by friends like the magazine editor Amy Astley, who noted that ''most New Yorkers who know about Blaine \uc2 Trump\uc2  think God's Love We Deliver. They don't think \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2 .''\par \par \uc2 After all, when your last name is \uc2 Trump\uc2  and you show up to a room full of New York liberals, people are bound to ask about the \uc2 election\uc2 . ''I'm speechless,'' Ms. \uc2 Trump\uc2  said, smiling her Julie Andrews-like smile, as guests like Iman and Kate Hudson made their way to the center table. ''Do you know where you're sitting?''\par \par \uc2 Moments later, Mr. Harris ascended to the lectern and began pillorying Ms. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's former brother-in-law. ''You could have just stayed at home and watched the latest news cycle about \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2 ,'' he said. ''But I'll stay positive. The best thing about \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  is -- \uc2 Alec Baldwin\uc2 .''\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 election\uc2  eventually took a temporary back seat to the matter at hand, which was a steak dinner and an auction led by Jamie Niven, formerly of \uc2 Sotheby's\uc2 , to raise money for God's Love, which provides meals to vulnerable New Yorkers living with H.I.V. and other illnesses.\par \par \uc2 A meal cooked by Mr. Harris and his husband, the chef David Burtka, went for $60,000, while a trip to San Francisco for a meal cooked by Alice Waters went for $50,000. Chrissy Teigen turned heads when she raised her hand and pledged $100,000. A few minutes later, Aerin Lauder, sitting nearby, pledged $25,000.\par \par \uc2 The night also honored the model Karlie Kloss (who was in Japan and happens to be dating Joshua Kushner, the brother-in-law of \uc2 Ivanka \uc2 Trump\uc2 ), the restaurateur Danny Meyer and Wing Tat Leung, a volunteer who has logged more than 26,000 hours with God's Love.\par \par \uc2 As the evening wound down around 10 p.m., and chocolate-covered strawberries were served, Ms. \uc2 Trump\uc2  was asked what she thought of Mr. Harris's speech, which included a suggestion that the Republican candidate change his campaign slogan to ''Make America Grope Again.''\par \par \uc2 ''I just sat there in silence,'' Ms. \uc2 Trump\uc2  said, laughing, before adding that she planned to skip the social circuit for the rest of the month to avoid the nagging political questions. ''I think it's just easier. Stay out of the fire.''\par \par \uc2 Continue following our fashion and lifestyle coverage on \uc2 Facebook\uc2  (Styles and Modern Love), \uc2 Twitter\uc2  (Styles, Fashion and Weddings) and \uc2 Instagram\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Above left, Steve Simon and Blaine \uc2 Trump\uc2 .

It's refreshing to read that children are able to sift through the claims and counterclaims and make informed decisions about the characters of the candidates.\par \par \uc2 Connor Felton, a seventh grader, surely understands: ''I think if you repeat some stuff that \uc2 Trump\uc2  says, you could get sent down to the principal's office. Maybe even expelled.''\par \par \uc2 Win or lose, Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  is clearly the person your parents raised you not to be.\par \par \uc2 ELINORE DELANEY\par \par \uc2 Shrewsbury, N.J.\par \par \uc2 To the Editor:\par \par \uc2 Please tell me what is wrong with me.

\par\par \b \uc2 Voters' Views Make a Round Trip\b0\par\par\uc2 By Aaron Zitner   \par \uc2 920 \uc2 words\par \uc2 20 October 2016\par \uc2 The Wall Street Journal\par \uc2 J\par A1\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 After all of this year's \uc2 election\uc2  turmoil -- the noisy clashes over \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2 's comments on immigrants and women,\uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's controversies over email and the \uc2 Clinton\uc2  Foundation\uc2  -- public views of the two candidates have wound up right where they were in January.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  and Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  are no more liked or disliked than when the year started, nor have more people come to view the prospect of their \uc2 election\uc2  with optimism, Wall Street Journal/NBC News polling finds. And in a head-to-head matchup, Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's 10-point lead of today is exactly where it stood in January, after some tightening in the race in the late spring and early summer.\par \par \uc2 Those numbers suggest that Wednesday night'sdebate, which produced some dramatic moments -- including clashes over immigration and national security, and Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's refusal to commit to accepting results of the vote -- is unlikely to change the trajectory of the race. The 2016 \uc2 election\uc2  may seem turbulent, with its battle of personalities, hacked emails and late-night tweets. But underneath, there has been more stability than volatility.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  started the year with 29% of voters saying they viewed him in a positive light, Journal/NBC News polls found. Today, that share is again at 29%.\par \par \uc2 Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  began the year with 40% of voters viewing her in a positive light. Today, the share remains at 40%.\par \par \uc2 In February, 33% of voters said they would feel optimistic or satisfied if Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  were elected president, and 43% said so of Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 . Now, those shares are nearly identical.\par \par \uc2 And asked in January which candidate they would pick for president, 51% of voters chose Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  and 41% Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  -- the same levels of support as today.\par \par \uc2 Each candidate has lived through ups and downs during the year: The public image of each took a hit in April, and Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's lead over Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  shriveled to 3 points in May.\par \par \uc2 Some voters remain in flux. Undecided and third-party voters seem to be gravitating toward the two major-party candidates, and recent polling suggests that women are moving more forcefully toward Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Yet overall, the voters have circled back to where they started. Daily news events, including the presidential debates, may appear to have a big impact on the \uc2 election\uc2 . "But in truth, everything that has happened up to now has left the voters in the same place," said \uc2 Peter Hart\uc2 , a Democratic pollster who works on the Journal/NBC News poll.\par \par \uc2 Micah Roberts, a Republican pollster who helps guide the poll, said the results show that Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's campaign hasn't accomplished one of its core goals.\par \par \uc2 "They had to make some chunk of voters more comfortable with a Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  presidency. And these numbers show that hasn't happened," he said.\par \par \uc2 The share of voters with positive views of Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  has never topped 30% in Journal/NBC surveys this year, and voters by a nearly 2-to-1 margin say they would be uncertain and pessimistic about a \uc2 Trump\uc2  presidency, rather than optimistic and satisfied.\par \par \uc2 For her part, Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  has made some progress in improving her image. This summer, she trailed Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  by 16 percentage points on the question of which candidate was more honest and straightforward; now, she trails by only 4 points. That suggests that one of her biggest liabilities is receding.\par \par \uc2 But on the broadest measure of her image, Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's standing is the same as in January. Half of voters view her unfavorably, and more than half say her \uc2 election\uc2  would leave them pessimistic and uncertain. Both measures are the same as at the start of the year.\par \par \uc2 To Mr. Hart, it comes as little surprise that neither candidate has succeeded in making more people enthusiastic about a \uc2 Trump\uc2  or \uc2 Clinton\uc2  presidency. "If you think the basic tenet of a campaign is to destroy your opponent, then in that case they have fulfilled their duties," he said.\par \par \uc2 That seemed to be a core mission of both candidates in Wednesday's debate. Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , in particular, prosecuted a case against Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's fitness for office, calling her opponent a "puppet" of the Russian government and saying that "he thinks belittling women makes him bigger." Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , for his part, called his rival "a nasty woman" and said she had acted "criminally" in destroying emails.\par \par \uc2 Jeff Horwitt, a Democratic pollster who also works on the Journal/NBC poll, pointed out that Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  and Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  were household names well before they started their campaigns, a contrast with many prior nominees.\par \par \uc2 In January, he noted, nearly nine in 10 voters felt they knew enough about Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  and Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  to offer an opinion, positive or negative, in Journal/NBC News surveys.\par \par \uc2 Impressions of Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  and Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  "had already been formed over years, if not decades," Mr. Horwitt said. Such longstanding views can be hard to change.\par \par \uc2 Both Messrs. Roberts and Hart said the numbers paint an unhappy picture of the months to come.\par \par \uc2 "We're going to elect, no matter who it is, the most unpopular president in the history of polling going back to the '30s," Mr. Roberts said. "Whichever person takes office is going to have a heckuva time governing with these kinds of numbers."\par \par \uc2 The next challenge, Mr. Hart said, is for the winner "to unite the nation."\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=wjco20161020000102"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document J000000020161020ecak0002n\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw272\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4080\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 1) \uc2 Clinton\uc2  Targeted character. \uc2 Trump\uc2  Targeted effectiveness.\par \par \uc2 In the most civil of the three presidential debates, it was \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  who wielded the sharpest jabs. In doing so, she took a role most often played by \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2 . Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  called her opponent a "puppet" of Russian President \uc2 Vladimir Putin\uc2 . She said that Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  cries "crocodile tears" about jobs lost to free trade while using Chinese steel in his buildings. But Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's strongest language came when she challenged Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's behavior toward women. "Donald thinks that belittling women makes him bigger," she said. Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , who said claims of inappropriate sexual behavior against him are fiction, accused Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  of running a "sleazy campaign" and of destroying emails. "Such a nasty woman," he said at one point. But he spent as much or more time challenging Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's effectiveness.\par \par \uc2 2. \uc2 Trump\uc2  is still not a traditional Republican.\par \par \uc2 After feuding with top members of his own party, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  looked more like a traditional Republican. He called for tax cuts, promised to uphold gun rights and said he would appoint Supreme Court justices who would overturn Roe v. Wade. Yet, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  reminded voters that he has created his own, unique brand of Republicanism. Many Republican leaders reject the warm language about Mr. Putin, an issue that arose again when he cast the Russian leader as more skilled in international affairs than Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 . And he acknowledged disagreeing with Ronald Reagan on the issue of free trade.\par \par \uc2 3. \uc2 Trump\uc2  returned to change and economy.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  had been close on Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's heels in polling this summer, a time when voters viewed him as the candidate of change and as best able to handle the economy. Since then, his edge on those issues has slipped. He returned to those themes, as many allies have long urged him to do. "We're bringing our jobs back" from Mexico and other offshoring locations, he promised.\par \par \uc2 4. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  stressed unity, \uc2 Trump\uc2  revival.\par \par \uc2 Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  said she adhered to core Democratic policy stances -- standing for abortion rights, same-sex marriage and "sensible" new gun regulations. But she also called for national unity, saying the next president has to "bring our country together." Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  talked more of restoring an America in disrepair. He returned to his signature line: "We are going to make American great again."\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=wjco20161020000101"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document J000000020161020ecak0002m\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw272\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4080\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 WASHINGTON -- Charges that \uc2 election\uc2  results might be rigged have moved from the fringes of U.S. politics to an \uc2 election\uc2  issue in the closing days of the 2016 campaign as Republican \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  has repeatedly and without corroborating evidence suggested a fair outcome may be impossible.\par \par \uc2 The 2000, 2004 and 2008 elections were hard-fought contests that all contained scattered allegations of fraud or mismanagement -- most notably, the largely unsubstantiated claims that the Ohio \uc2 election\uc2  results from the 2004 campaign were inaccurate.\par \par \uc2 But those claims have taken on an official veneer in the 2016 campaign as Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  has spent the final weeks of the race raising doubts about the integrity of his contest against Democratic presidential candidate \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  before most votes have even been cast.\par \par \uc2 He has accused the media, the Justice Department, the \uc2 Federal Bureau of Investigation\uc2  and a "global power structure" of conspiring to rig the November \uc2 election\uc2  against him.\par \par \uc2 At Wednesday's debate, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  alleged that there are "millions of people that are registered to vote that shouldn't be registered to vote" and cast doubt on whether he would accept the \uc2 election\uc2  results.\par \par \uc2 Democrats have pushed back against the notion that the \uc2 election\uc2  will be fraudulent. "\uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  is trying to convince voters that their votes don't count by telling them that the system is rigged. He's wrong. Voting has never been easier," interim Democratic National Committee Chairwoman Donna Brazile said last week.\par \par \uc2 Complaints about \uc2 election\uc2  integrity have a long history in American politics. The 1960 \uc2 election\uc2  between John F. Kennedy and Richard Nixon brought reports of dead voters casting ballots in Illinois.\par \par \uc2 Still, examples of \uc2 election\uc2  fraud are rare.\par \par \uc2 In a comprehensive review of cases between 2000 and 2012, Carnegie-Knight News21 Initiative, a nonprofit journalism project at \uc2 Arizona State University\uc2 , found that most related to casting absentee ballots -- and even those were exceedingly small. In-person fraud prosecutions were virtually nonexistent, the study found. In another case, Loyola Law School Professor \uc2 Justin Levitt\uc2  identified just 31 cases of voter fraud between 2000 and 2014 out of more than one billion ballots cast.\par \par \uc2 Asked on MSNBC Wednesday about whether there would be large-scale fraud on \uc2 Election\uc2  Day, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's campaign manager, Kellyanne Conway, said: "No, I don't believe that."\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=wjco20161020000099"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document J000000020161020ecak0002k\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw272\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4080\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 In the third and final presidential debate, Republican \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2 's refusal to say he would accept the results of the \uc2 election\uc2  was the last straw for at least some voters who had been struggling with their decision.\par \par \uc2 Bijan Sharifi, a 34-year-old high-school teacher, said he was horrified by Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's comment during the debate that "I will tell you at the time" whether he would abide by the \uc2 election\uc2 's outcome. Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  has been warning for months about a "rigged \uc2 election\uc2 " and has stepped up those allegations recently as he has slipped in the polls.\par \par \uc2 "I just saw a constitutional crisis on television," said Mr. Sharifi, who said he intends to vote for Libertarian candidate \uc2 Gary Johnson\uc2 . "That was mind-blowing. I'm afraid there's going to be terrorism and extremism after the \uc2 election\uc2 , and I don't think \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  is the leader who will unify the country."\par \par \uc2 Lori Long, a retired paper-mill worker in Clarkston, Wash., tuned into the final presidential debate hoping to give Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  one last shot.\par \par \uc2 Ms. Long, who voted for Republicans \uc2 John McCain\uc2  in 2008 and \uc2 Mitt Romney\uc2  in 2012, said she could never cast a ballot for Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , the Democratic nominee, but that Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's remarks about potentially not accepting the results of the \uc2 election\uc2 , as well as about his treatment of women, turned her off for good.\par \par \uc2 "If I had to vote tomorrow, it still wouldn't be for either one of them," Ms. Long said. "I am so against her it's just unbelievable. But I looked at him, and he opened his mouth, and that's enough to stop me right there. Would I want him as my president? God no, I wouldn't."\par \par \uc2 Twenty days before the \uc2 election\uc2 , with two of the most unpopular nominees in history, some voters were unsure of what to do, even after watching the final debate.\par \par \uc2 The debate brought Rick Saucier, a real-estate broker in Orlando, Fla., one step closer to a decision. He ruled out Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  once and for all, because of what he said was her non-response to a question about the emails hacked by \uc2 WikiLeaks\uc2  from her campaign manager's account. "If I've made up my mind, it's about despising \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 ," said Mr. Saucier, who voted for the last two Republican nominees. "I think so little of her. She doesn't answer questions."\par \par \uc2 Some voters, turned off by the vitriolic tone of the first two debates, tuned out of the third one entirely.\par \par \uc2 "I'm not voting for either of those candidates anyway, and I just figure it's just going to be more of the same nonsense," said Garrett Thacker, 30, who works at a car dealership in Galloway, Ohio. He said he plans to cast a ballot for independent candidate Evan McMullin.\par \par \uc2 Ben Robinson, 33, a project manager for a custom home builder in Houston, also avoided the final presidential debate. He has settled on the Libertarian, Mr. Johnson. "I just really don't care about what either of them has to say anymore," he said.\par \par \uc2 "If I had to choose, I guess I would rather end up getting stuck with Hillary," he added. "I disagree with just about everything she says, but that's politics. \uc2 Trump\uc2  -- he's just dangerous."\par \par \uc2 So who are the undecided voters in America?\par \par \uc2 About 8% of the electorate declined to choose either nominee or a third-party candidate in the latest Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll. Most of them prefer a Republican-controlled Congress, suggesting they lean Republican but can't abide Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 . They also tend to be female and younger.\par \par \uc2 One development that may help Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  in the homestretch is she has improved her image among the voters, while Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  hasn't.\par \par \uc2 Negative views of Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  outweighed positive ones by 33 percentage points in this week's Journal/NBC News poll, about the same as in other recent surveys.\par \par \uc2 For Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , negative views outweighed positive ones by 10 percentage points in the poll released this week. That's an improvement from April, when negative views outweighed positive ones by 24 points.\par \par \uc2 ---\par \par \uc2 Aaron Zitner contributed to this article.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=wjco20161020000098"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document J000000020161020ecak0002j\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw272\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4080\pichgoal600

\par\par \b \uc2 Election\uc2  2016 --- CAPITAL JOURNAL: After Sedate Start, \uc2 Trump\uc2  Takes the Bait\b0\par\par\uc2 By Gerald F. Seib   \par \uc2 796 \uc2 words\par \uc2 20 October 2016\par \uc2 The Wall Street Journal\par \uc2 J\par A4\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 For a while Wednesday night, at the final presidential debate, \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  was a more sedate and persuasive candidate, the one who calmly explains his positions while avoiding verbal fisticuffs.\par \par \uc2 Then his favorite topic -- building a wall to stop illegal immigration across the southern border -- came up, and Democrat \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  said Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  met Mexico's president and failed to repeat face-to-face his demand that Mexico pay for building that wall. "He choked," she said.\par \par \uc2 At that point, the tenor of the evening changed. If Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  was baiting Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , he took the bait. He considers himself a master counterpuncher, and he began punching back.\par \par \uc2 A familiar, nasty cloud descended over the conversation, and a kind of downward spiral began, until Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  said Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  shouldn't even have been allowed to run.\par \par \uc2 Then, stunningly, he refused to say he would honor the results of the \uc2 election\uc2 . "What I'm saying, I will tell you at the time," he said. "I will keep you in suspense."\par \par \uc2 That is unprecedented and will be the answer for which this debate will be remembered. It's also an answer that will leave other Republicans scrambling. They already had been distancing themselves from his earlier comments that voting would be "rigged." Casting doubt on the validity of voting is an invitation to the party's own supporters not to bother voting, other Republicans fear, and GOP and Democratic candidates alike hope to win in November in elections that are seen as fair and valid.\par \par \uc2 In sum, for a debate that had a refreshingly substantive start, the tense and nasty exchanges that led to that moment, and the ones that followed it, took the front seat. To that extent, it felt a bit like a repeat, and one that seemed unlikely to change the shape of the race -- which is to the advantage of Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , the clear leader heading into the night.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  accused Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  of wanting to open the nation's borders and having criminally destroyed 33,000 emails from her private server. She, in turn, said he would be a Russian "puppet" who has encouraged the Kremlin to hack into the email systems of her supporters to influence the outcome of the \uc2 election\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 He accused her of running a "very sleazy campaign" that hired thugs to disrupt his campaign rallies. She said he has been discovered to be a predator to women and denied it by insulting women.\par \par \uc2 She said he is unqualified to have the codes to the country's nuclear weapons. He said she was responsible for the birth of Islamic State. She stayed on the attack, on his tax returns, on his use of immigrant labor and onward, and smiled as he responded. He grew angry and resumed interrupting her answers.\par \par \uc2 To anyone who has been listening, there was little new of substance. To the extent there was substance, both nominees appeared to be framing their arguments designed more to lock down their supporters than to expand their universe.\par \par \uc2 The two candidates entered the debate facing different but parallel strategic choices, reflecting both their relative standing in the polls and their potential paths through the remainder of the campaign.\par \par \uc2 For Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , the question was whether to carry what amounts to his scorched-earth strategy -- bash Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  as corrupt and dishonest and proclaim that the \uc2 election\uc2  and the political process is rigged -- or pivot back to his populist economic message about lost jobs and bad trade deals. The latter approach might broaden out his appeal. But the former approach has ginned his base, and that along with dragging down Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  seem to be the primary goals of the \uc2 Trump\uc2  enterprise at this point.\par \par \uc2 Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , by contrast, had to choose whether to duke it out with Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  on his terms, going on the attack on his personal flaws and answering his attacks in kind, or ignore that terrain and try to strike a more positive note in what was essentially her closing argument to voters. The positive note had some appeal to \uc2 Clinton\uc2  advisers. But the fear was that there also would be great danger in leaving \uc2 Trump\uc2  attacks unanswered.\par \par \uc2 In the end, each tried a bit of both approaches available to them.\par \par \uc2 It seems unlikely that the debate did little more than confirm the views of voters who already seem mostly locked in on their choices. Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  needed to shake up a race in which he is trailing, and Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  made clear she wasn't going to sit back and allow him to find an opening to do that.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=wjco20161020000092"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document J000000020161020ecak0002d\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw272\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4080\pichgoal600

\par\par \b \uc2 Election\uc2  2016: \uc2 John McCain\uc2  Finds Race Isn't a Lock\b0\par\par\uc2 By Siobhan Hughes   \par \uc2 465 \uc2 words\par \uc2 20 October 2016\par \uc2 The Wall Street Journal\par \uc2 J\par A7\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 TUCSON, Ariz. -- Republican \uc2 John McCain\uc2 , war hero, five-term senator and his party's 2008 candidate for president, is such a national name that GOP Senate candidates in other parts of the country want him for campaign events.\par \par \uc2 This week, Democrats are using their own marquee names in his home state in a bid to bolster their own brand, an effort to help presidential nominee \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  while also boosting Mr. McCain's Democratic challenger, Rep. Ann Kirkpatrick.\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 Clinton\uc2  campaign announced on Monday that it would spend $2 million on advertising here. And Democrats are sending one of their most popular speakers -- first lady \uc2 Michelle Obama\uc2  -- to the state on Thursday. The campaign sent Sen. Bernie Sanders to Arizona on Tuesday, followed by Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's daughter, Chelsea, on Wednesday.\par \par \uc2 Mr. McCain's dilemma is the same as that of other Republicans, who need voters who strongly back GOP presidential nominee \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2 , but also must keep those who are offended by the nominee. His job is now being made harder in the face of an onslaught by the top figures in the Democratic Party, who can use their money and time to try to define Mr. McCain in ways that exacerbate divisions in his party.\par \par \uc2 "Arizona is one where it is worth watching, particularly if \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  starts shifting considerable money from her own race into a coordinated campaign that helps down-ballot candidates," said \uc2 Nathan Gonzales\uc2 , editor and publisher of the Rothenberg & Gonzales Political Report, a nonpartisan newsletter.\par \par \uc2 Mr. McCain has survived a formidable primary challenge and separated himself from Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , whose anti-immigration views are a drag in a state where Hispanics account for 30% of the population and 22% of eligible voters. As of Wednesday, he was up 16 percentage points in the polls, according to the Real Clear Politics average.\par \par \uc2 Now, with the \uc2 Trump\uc2  campaign on the defense about his remarks about and treatment of women, Mr. McCain enters the final three weeks of his race facing a new challenge. The Arizona Republican has better funding and name recognition than his rival, but no one counted on the Democrats to send in their biggest stars and invest in a traditionally Republican state.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's comments about women animated Democrats and independents -- key voting constituencies that helped put Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  5 points ahead of Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  in this state, according to an Arizona Republic/Morrison/Cronkite News poll released Wednesday. The comments also prompted Mr. McCain to formally withdraw his support of Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , a decision that inflamed a right-leaning, populist wing of the Republican base that tried to oust Mr. McCain in a primary.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=wjco20161020000091"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document J000000020161020ecak0002c\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw272\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4080\pichgoal600

\par\par \b \uc2 Election\uc2  2016: \uc2 Trump\uc2  Project Tied to Visa Plan\b0\par\par\uc2 By Esther Fung and Peter Grant   \par \uc2 623 \uc2 words\par \uc2 20 October 2016\par \uc2 The Wall Street Journal\par \uc2 J\par A7\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 The \uc2 Trump\uc2  Organization\uc2  is partnering with a developer on a Texas hotel project that seeks to tap a controversial program granting green cards to foreigners who invest in the U.S.\par \par \uc2 The federal EB-5 program gives up to 10,000 green cards a year to foreigners who invest at least $500,000 in U.S. businesses deemed to create at least 10 American jobs per investor.\par \par \uc2 The Republican presidential nominee's company is lending the \uc2 Trump\uc2  name to the 33-story luxury hotel and condominium development in downtown Austin, while its partner, Global Management Resources, would take charge of the construction, according to marketing materials reviewed by The Wall Street Journal.\par \par \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  has made tighter immigration control a pillar of his presidential campaign. He has also criticized China's trade and financial policies, blaming them for economic woes at home.\par \par \uc2 "Our growth strategy is to expand the \uc2 Trump\uc2  Hotels\uc2  portfolio by strategically opening properties in key U.S. and international locations," said a representative for \uc2 Trump\uc2  Hotels\uc2 , part of the \uc2 Trump\uc2  Organization\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 The representative said the company hasn't invested its own capital in the Austin project, but remains interested from a brand and management standpoint. Global Management didn't respond to a request for comment.\par \par \uc2 The EB-5 program was created in 1990, and for much of its history was used by only a few hundred investors a year. But since 2008, developers have flocked to it as a form of low-cost loans for projects. Because many foreign investors are motivated primarily by the prospect of a green card -- not the financial investment -- they tend to accept below-market interest rates, meaning big savings for developers. A large majority of those investors in recent years have hailed from China, typically accounting for more than 80% of EB-5 visas.\par \par \uc2 At least $8.7 billion has been invested in the U.S. economy through the program since Oct. 1, 2012, and an estimated 35,140 jobs have been created for U.S. workers through foreign investment via EB-5, according to the Immigrant Investor Program Office at \uc2 U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 While some in Congress have criticized the program's premise -- giving green cards to wealthy investors -- other issues also have cast a cloud over the program in recent years. Some developers and middlemen who have raised money through the program have been alleged to be involved in fraudulent schemes.\par \par \uc2 The program also has become dominated by developers of projects in wealthy neighborhoods who are using a provision meant to aid economically ailing ones.\par \par \uc2 A study released Wednesday by the \uc2 U.S. Government Accountability Office\uc2  found just 12% of investment went to projects located in a census tract with an unemployment rate of at least 8%, even though those projects benefited from a provision earmarked for high-unemployment areas. A large chunk -- 36% -- was for projects in a tract with an unemployment rate of 4% or lower.\par \par \uc2 The program is due to expire in December, and lawmakers are clashing over proposed changes.\par \par \uc2 The entity pooling the EB-5 money for the $170 million \uc2 Trump\uc2 -branded hotel, Renewable Texas Energy Regional Center LLC, is seeking $40 million from 80 EB-5 investors. The center estimated the project will create 1,427 direct and indirect jobs.\par \par \uc2 Another \uc2 Trump\uc2 -branded project has applied for EB-5 funding: an apartment tower in Jersey City, N.J., being developed by \uc2 Kushner Cos\uc2 . and KABR Group. The chief executive of Kushner is \uc2 Jared Kushner\uc2 , who is married to Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's daughter, Ivanka.\par \par \uc2 ---\par \par \uc2 Josh Chin and Eliot Brown contributed to this article.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=wjco20161020000089"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document J000000020161020ecak0002a\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw272\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4080\pichgoal600

Critics said that didn't make up for him once calling Mexican immigrants rapists and criminals.\par \par \uc2 Trump\uc2  Hotel workers voted to join the Culinary Workers Union in December, but haven't been able to negotiate a contract with hotel management.\par \par \uc2 A coalition of Democratic, union and liberal groups -- including American Bridge, a Washington, D.C., opposition research group -- also sent 40 taco trucks around the city to register voters Tuesday, the last day to register in Nevada.\par \par \uc2 -- Janet Hook\par \par \uc2 ---\par \par \uc2 VOTING\par \par \uc2 RNC\uc2  Sends Reminder\par \par \uc2 On 'Ballot Security'\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 Republican National Committee\uc2  asked members to avoid \uc2 election\uc2 -related "ballot security" activities such as poll watching in their capacity as Republican Party officers, citing a decades-old court settlement restricting such activities by GOP officials.\par \par \uc2 As part of a 1982 settlement in a lawsuit brought by Democrats, the \uc2 RNC\uc2  agreed to curb its efforts to monitor and challenge voter eligibility at the polls, especially in districts where the racial or ethnic composition of the electorate could be a factor in the outcome.\par \par \uc2 RNC general counsel \uc2 John Ryder\uc2  wrote to members on Wednesday to "remind you of the restrictions placed on the \uc2 RNC\uc2  by the consent decree."\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 RNC\uc2  membership is made up of 168 state party representatives, three from each state and territory.\par \par \uc2 The reminder from the \uc2 RNC\uc2  could complicate GOP candidate \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2 's efforts to recruit \uc2 election\uc2  observers to monitor polling places for intimidation. Though an \uc2 RNC\uc2  official said the decree doesn't apply to campaigns or state parties, no committee resources can be used on those efforts.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's campaign didn't respond to a request for comment.\par \par \uc2 -- Byron Tau\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=wjco20161020000088"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document J000000020161020ecak00029\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw272\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4080\pichgoal600

\par\par \b \uc2 World News: Hackers Evolve to Serve the Kremlin\b0\par\par\uc2 By James Marson In Moscow, Sam Schechner In Paris and Alan Cullison in Washington   \par \uc2 639 \uc2 words\par \uc2 20 October 2016\par \uc2 The Wall Street Journal\par \uc2 J\par A12\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 With the hacking of \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's campaign and the \uc2 Democratic National Committee\uc2 , U.S. officials say Russia has unleashed a strengthened cyberwarfare weapon to sow uncertainty about the U.S. democratic process.\par \par \uc2 In doing so, Russia has transformed state-sponsored hackers known as Fancy Bear and Cozy Bear from internet spies to political tools with the power to target the country's adversaries, U.S. officials and cybersecurity experts say.\par \par \uc2 The attacks are the harder side of parallel campaigns in the Kremlin's English-language media, which broadcast negative news about Western institutions and alliances and focus on issues that demonstrate or stoke instability in the West, such as Brexit. Moscow seeks particularly to weaken the \uc2 North Atlantic Treaty Organization\uc2 , which has expanded its defense against Russia.\par \par \uc2 "The underlying philosophy of a lot of these attacks is about establishing information as a weapon," said Alexander Klimburg, a cyber expert at the Hague Center for Strategic Studies. "Hacking for them is literally about controlling information."\par \par \uc2 President \uc2 Vladimir Putin\uc2  denies Russian involvement in the hacking, but in a way that telegraphs glee about the potential chaos being sown in the U.S. democratic process.\par \par \uc2 "Everyone is talking about who did it, but is it so important who did it?" Mr. Putin said. "What is important is the content of this information."\par \par \uc2 Former Central Intelligence Agency Director Michael Hayden said the Kremlin doesn't appear to be trying to influence the \uc2 election\uc2 's outcome, noting Russian involvement has provided fodder for both Republicans and Democrats. "They are not trying to pick a winner," he said on Tuesday at a cybersecurity conference in Washington. Rather, Russia is likely unleashing the emails "to mess with our heads."\par \par \uc2 Pro-Kremlin commentators in Russia have seized on the DNC leaks to cast doubt on the American democratic process and argue that Washington has no right to criticize Moscow. They have said the hacked DNC emails, which showed party officials working to undermine primary runner-up Bernie Sanders, prove Americans are hypocritical when they malign Mr. Putin's authoritarianism.\par \par \uc2 The White House has threatened a "proportional response" against Russia.\par \par \uc2 Retaliating against murky cyberattackers is uncertain new territory, Western officials said. The group often called Fancy Bear has been active since at least 2007 or 2008, experts say. Multiple security companies have given the group different code names including Pawn Storm, Sofacy and APT 28, which denotes an "advanced persistent threat."\par \par \uc2 Another group, known as Cozy Bear or APT 29, has taken a lower profile, often targeting higher-profile individuals and uses more sophisticated tools to cover its tracks, cybersecurity experts said. It was active as early as 2008 and 2009, with targets related to Chechnya, a U.S.-based think tank and government institutions in Poland and the Czech Republic, according to security firm \uc2 F-Secure Corp\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 The methods are well known: Hackers trick targets into providing account information or downloading infected files through expertly faked emails and webpages, a tactic known as spear-phishing.\par \par \uc2 The link to Russia's security apparatus is based in part on technical clues. The two groups' malware is deemed too sophisticated for most criminal gangs.\par \par \uc2 Yet it is the groups' selection of targets that offers the most compelling evidence of Russian involvement, cybersecurity experts say.\par \par \uc2 "This all adds up to a strong indication of Russian sponsorship," said Laura Galante, director of global intelligence at U.S.-based security firm \uc2 FireEye Inc\uc2 . and a former Russia specialist at the U.S. Department of Defense. "The Russian government has very publicly stated its desire to have ability in this realm. They want the ability to shape the way people think about events."\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=wjco20161020000051"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document J000000020161020ecak0001e\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw272\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4080\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 The \uc2 WikiLeaks\uc2  email dumps are giving voters some insights into the realities of hardball politics. It isn't pretty. Take the recent disclosures that show how the \uc2 Clinton\uc2  campaign plotted to raise a bundle of campaign cash but then use the government to attack opponents for trying to do the same thing.\par \par \uc2 In an email exchange in May 2015, \uc2 John Podesta\uc2 , now the \uc2 Clinton\uc2  campaign chairman, \uc2 Clinton\uc2  campaign lawyer Marc Elias and other staffers including Jennifer Palmieri and Huma Abedin discussed an article claiming the \uc2 Federal \uc2 Election\uc2  Commission\uc2  was unable to curb \uc2 election\uc2  abuses because its bipartisan makeup led to 3-3 deadlocks.\par \par \uc2 The campaign crew had been discussing the idea of stacking the \uc2 FEC\uc2  with new members to end the tie votes. In the meantime, "[Marc] Elias may have some legal ideas to slow them down," Mr. Podesta wrote. "We have 3 things we have to do. Raise the primary $ by expanding the bundler network. Get Priorities functional. Use this [theme of \uc2 FEC\uc2  dysfunction] to scare our people into giving bigger sums."\par \par \uc2 Clinton\uc2  campaign manager Robby Mook responded, "I agree with you, John. I think we focus hard on raising as much as we can and then throw the kitchen sink at everyone who we believe steps over the line, understanding that has limited impact."\par \par \uc2 Marc Elias responded that he thought the article overstated the problem but noted that, "There is every reason to think DOJ will increasingly police the campaign finance laws." He added, "Every time a GOP candidate does something even close to the line, they are hit by a complaint."\par \par \uc2 Nonetheless, Mr. Elias added, if the goal is to find new legal techniques to slow down conservative groups, he had an idea. "[T]here is one legal tool we could use that might slow them down. The law has a little noticed or used provision that says that if a complaint has been filed and it is either dismissed or not acted upon within 120 days the entity that filed the complaint can sue the \uc2 FEC\uc2  to force it to proceed with enforcement. If the \uc2 FEC\uc2  fails to move forward, then the complainant is permitted to bring their own lawsuit to enforce the law directly."\par \par \uc2 That is, they could gin up a campaign among progressives to start suing conservative groups. A few days later, on May 7, 2015, Mr. Mook emailed to request a call with \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  to discuss topics including "\uc2 FEC\uc2  enforcement options."\par \par \uc2 To sum up, the \uc2 Clinton\uc2  brain trust plotted to raise as much money as possible under current campaign laws, which they certainly have. As everyone has reported, no candidate in history has raised more big money from more rich donors than Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  has. But having cashed in themselves, the \uc2 Clinton\uc2  campaign then plotted to use the government's campaign-finance enforcement machinery to harass their opponents for raising money.\par \par \uc2 And sure enough, the political left has ginned up a media campaign to change the \uc2 FEC\uc2 , and the Justice Department announced intensified scrutiny of campaign fundraising. We criticized both moves, and we hope that has helped deter some nasty partisan abuse.\par \par \uc2 One of the many reasons we oppose limits on campaign donations is that politicians inevitably use them to punish their opponents. The \uc2 Clinton\uc2  campaign emails show this calculation in especially cynical form.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=wjco20161020000048"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document J000000020161020ecak0001b\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw272\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4080\pichgoal600

\par\par \b \uc2 Can Republicans Save the Senate?\b0\par\par\uc2 By Karl Rove   \par \uc2 850 \uc2 words\par \uc2 20 October 2016\par \uc2 The Wall Street Journal\par \uc2 J\par A13\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 Absent any knockout blow during Wednesday night's presidential debate, the final 19 days of campaigning still matter. What happens between now and Nov. 8 can materially affect which party controls not only the White House but also Congress.\par \par \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  is significantly behind, largely because of his own mistakes. He trails \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  by 6.5 points, 48.6% to 42.1% in the latest Real Clear Politics average of polls. In the campaign's final days, he must show far more discipline and focus than he demonstrated following the first two debates.\par \par \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  is widely seen as having outfoxed and baited him in their first encounter, on Sept. 26. Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  responded by haranguing a former Miss Universe for six days. Dumb.\par \par \uc2 The Republican nominee substantially improved his performance in the Oct. 9 debate -- but then spent the next week declaring war on fellow Republicans and claiming that the \uc2 election\uc2  is rigged against him. Another dumb move.\par \par \uc2 While he was wandering off message, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  paid scant attention to breaking news. Instead of seizing on events that would strengthen his narrative of change, he pursued themes that excite only his most ardent existing supporters.\par \par \uc2 Take two days last week. On Tuesday, Oct. 11, news broke that Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's campaign had communicated with Justice Department officials about a court hearing on her email server -- while the \uc2 FBI\uc2  was still investigating. But Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's focus that day was attacking Speaker \uc2 Paul Ryan\uc2  as "very weak and ineffective" and then tweeting, "It is so nice that the shackles have been taken off me and I can now fight for America the way I want to."\par \par \uc2 On Wednesday, Oct. 12, Minnesota Gov. Mark Dayton, a Democrat, told the truth about ObamaCare. Premiums for 250,000 Minnesotans covered under the plan will rise by 50% next year. "The Affordable Care Act," Gov. Dayton said, "is no longer affordable." This was political manna. Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  could have bundled it with President \uc2 Bill \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's statement a week earlier that ObamaCare is "the craziest thing in the world." Instead he dominated coverage by telling a rally that Republican leaders were conspiring against him: "There's a whole sinister deal going on."\par \par \uc2 Obsessing about media bias and alleging that the system is rigged might appeal to Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's base, but it does nothing to win support from undecided voters, and he's behind.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's campaign machinery also leaves a lot to be desired. He has largely ceded the get-out-the-vote effort to the \uc2 Republican National Committee\uc2 , but there's much more that he could do to funnel supporters into the GOP's ground operations.\par \par \uc2 Then there's the air war. Despite pledges in September to pump $140 million into television and digital advertising, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  has been outspent on TV by 3 to 1. Total spending on presidential campaign ads so far is $342 million, according to a \uc2 CNN\uc2  analysis of data from Kantar Media/CMAG, a nonpartisan ad-monitoring firm. Three-quarters of that has been by spent by the \uc2 Clinton\uc2  campaign and its outside allies.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's shortcomings also affect Republican candidates running for the Senate and the House. Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  has moved resources into red states to broaden the Electoral College battlefield. Her campaign is now mounting a serious effort to grab Arizona, which no Democratic presidential candidate has carried since \uc2 Bill \uc2 Clinton\uc2  in 1996, and Georgia, which Democrats last won in 1992. She's also adding millions to get-out-the-vote efforts in Missouri, North Carolina and Indiana to aid Democratic Senate candidates in those states.\par \par \uc2 Other Democratic groups are expanding their down-ballot spending as well. Even Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's super PAC, Priorities USA, is buying ads in Senate races. As a result, during the campaign's final three weeks, Democrats are on track to outspend Republicans on TV by $25 million in Indiana, Missouri, New Hampshire, Nevada, North Carolina and Pennsylvania. Outside Republican groups like the super PAC I'm associated with, American Crossroads/Senate Leadership Fund, will narrow the gap some. But Democrats have a financial edge, helped by $108 million in union spending through August, up 38% over 2012.\par \par \uc2 Still, for almost every action in politics, there is an opposite reaction. In 1996, \uc2 Bill \uc2 Clinton\uc2  won re-\uc2 election\uc2  by 8.5% of the popular vote, but the GOP picked up a net of two Senate seats, as Republican Senate candidates ran an average of 7.6 points ahead of their standard-bearer, \uc2 Sen. Bob Dole\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 That year, Americans did not want to give a \uc2 Clinton\uc2  a blank check. This year, the GOP could tap into the same sentiment, with a \uc2 Clinton\uc2  far less popular than her husband was. That may be the best Republicans can hope for, but for this to end happy, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  must run stronger.\par \par \uc2 ---\par \par \uc2 Mr. Rove helped organize the political-action committee American Crossroads and is the author of "The Triumph of William McKinley" (\uc2 Simon & Schuster\uc2 , 2015).\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=wjco20161020000029"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document J000000020161020ecak0000s\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw272\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4080\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 Letters to the Editor\par \b \uc2 Emasculated Voters Get What They Deserve\b0\par\par\uc2 773 \uc2 words\par \uc2 20 October 2016\par \uc2 The Wall Street Journal\par \uc2 J\par A14\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 Yale Prof. David Gelernter does a superb job recapping President \uc2 Obama\uc2 's serial abuse of executive power over the last eight years, the damage he did to America's standing in the world and to Americans' confidence in their own government, and the impending damage of Obama III in a Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  administration ("\uc2 Trump\uc2  and the Emasculated Voter," op-ed, Oct. 15).\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 Obama\uc2 /\uc2 Clinton\uc2 /progressive contempt for average voters is woven into their DNA, but is it undeserved? President \uc2 Obama\uc2  did, after all, win re-\uc2 election\uc2  rather handily. His job approval rating stands today above 50%, not too shabby after years of treating voters as six-year-olds, ignoring Congress, trying to bully the Supreme Court, ruling by executive fiat and overseeing a feeble economic recovery. If Mr. Gelernter is right that President \uc2 Obama\uc2  has governed like a stern baby sitter and "doesn't give a damn what people think," what does that say about we, the emasculated people, and the state of the nation? Consider, too, that without the Constitution's 22nd Amendment preventing a third run for president, Mr. Obama might be on the way to another victory.\par \par \uc2 Emasculated voters seem reconciled to a new progressive vision of the American way of life and a new world order with America no longer leader of the pack. The profound contempt that the president and Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  share for Americans isn't a deal breaker. If Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  can run on her character as we know it and President \uc2 Obama\uc2 's record as we've experienced it and still win, progressive treatment of Americans as dimwits is more than justified.\par \par \uc2 Frank Allen\par \par \uc2 Charlotte, N.C.\par \par \uc2 ---\par \par \uc2 I sincerely hope that Prof. Gelernter has nonrevocable tenure. By airing his rejection of the university orthodoxy, he has potentially sabotaged his professional future. At best, he will be subjected to classroom boycotts, accusations of microaggressions, demands for classroom safe-spaces, censure or reprimand. It matters little that his assessments are accurate and ring true. Would that we were all so courageous!\par \par \uc2 Lyle S. Mindlin\par \par \uc2 Okemos, Mich.\par \par \uc2 ---\par \par \uc2 It is precisely \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  who has emasculated us by failing to offer a reasonable alternative to \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Jeff Bodenstab\par \par \uc2 Boston\par \par \uc2 ---\par \par \uc2 What gives anyone reason to think that the Republicans (or Democrats) in Congress will have any sway whatsoever over Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 ? They have been completely flummoxed by him and unable to temper any aspect of his puerile, impetuous and unpredictable remarks.\par \par \uc2 Peter Johnson\par \par \uc2 Woodbury, Conn.\par \par \uc2 ---\par \par \uc2 Our government was founded during a period we now call the Age of Reason, an age that was committed to thinking and reasoning to come to the best decisions. Let's quit our emotional whining and examine our political truths. And women? We will vote for the better candidate because we do not fear emasculation.\par \par \uc2 Catherine Bennett\par \par \uc2 Portland, Ore.\par \par \uc2 ---\par \par \uc2 Mr. Gelernter argues that if Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  acts in the Oval Office the way he has acted for the past 60 years, we can simply impeach him. And therefore Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  will not act as crazy in the Oval Office as he has on the campaign trail.\par \par \uc2 I can't believe this needs to be pointed out, but the argument that we can just impeach Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  is possibly the worst argument that can be made for electing anyone to the most powerful office in the world. If Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's supporters are already putting impeachment on the table, how about we skip those proceedings and not elect a man who lacks almost all basic qualifications to be president?\par \par \uc2 Jeff Beamer\par \par \uc2 New York\par \par \uc2 ---\par \par \uc2 David Gelernter seems to forget that we are a democracy. His views aren't supported by the majority of the country, and possibly this is why other people with those views feel left out. In fact, our country was built on immigration and no, that certainly doesn't mean, as Mr. Gelernter claims, that "all mankind have a right to camp in your backyard." The vetting process is long and thorough. As a Jew, I shutter to think where I and my ancestors might be today had views like Mr. Gelernter's prevailed. There has always been a xenophobic element in our country that maligned immigrants no matter where they came from. No, Mr. Gelertner, this is 2016 and most of us have finally grown up and recognize that there are individuals of value that are different from us.\par \par \uc2 Howard Brenner\par \par \uc2 Woodmere, N.Y.\par \par \uc2 ---\par \par \uc2 Mr. Gelernter has perfectly consolidated and articulated all of my disjointed grumblings.\par \par \uc2 Gelernter for president!\par \par \uc2 Carla Harman\par \par \uc2 San Antonio\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=wjco20161020000002"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document J000000020161020ecak00001\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 ECONOMIC SCENE\par \uc2 Business/Financial Desk; SECTB\par \b \uc2 Bold Strike Against Poverty: A Check for Every Child\b0\par\par\uc2 By EDUARDO PORTER \par \uc2 1,338 \uc2 words\par \uc2 19 October 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 1\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 How can it be that the United States spends so much money fighting poverty and still suffers one of the highest child poverty rates among advanced nations?\par \par \uc2 One in five American children is poor by the count of LIS, a data archive tracking well-being and deprivation around the world. By international standards that set the poverty line at one-half the income of families on the middle rung of the income ladder, the United States tolerated more child poverty in 2012 than 30 of the 35 countries in the \uc2 Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development\uc2 , a grouping of advanced industrialized nations.\par \par \uc2 The percentage of children who are poor is more than three times as high in the United States as it is in Norway or the Netherlands. America has a larger proportion of poor children than Russia.\par \par \uc2 So what's going on? We may spend a lot of money, but we don't spend it well. It turns out that the most generous federal programs for families with children barely help the nation's unluckiest children. Rather, they generally push money to their counterparts higher up the ladder of well-being.\par \par \uc2 The child tax deduction -- which allows families to exclude $4,000 a child from their taxable income -- avoids the poor almost entirely. Just over 1 percent of the $40 billion it costs the federal budget every year flows to the poorest fifth of the population. That works out to an average benefit of $10 a poor family, according to calculations by the nonpartisan \uc2 Tax Policy Center\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 The $58 billion child tax credit that reduces a tax bill by $1,000 a child is more progressive. But families in the bottom fifth get only a tenth of the money, each receiving an average of $120 a year. To be sure, tax credits make a difference for many poor families, cutting the child poverty rate by almost a third, according to the Census Bureau's new Supplemental Poverty Measure, which considers the effect of taxes and transfers on poverty. Still, children whose parents don't work are left to rely mostly on food stamps. The American safety net has little else to offer. But perhaps this is poor children's lucky year.\par \par \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , who, according to most polls, will be the next American president, unveiled a set of programs last week to help families with children.\par \par \uc2 She proposed to double the child tax credit to $2,000 for each child up to the age of 4 and to restructure the benefit so more of it flows to very-low-income families. Today, the credit is worth only $300 to a mother of two who earns $5,000 a year. Under Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's proposal, it could be worth $2,250.\par \par \uc2 According to the \uc2 Center for Budget and Policy Priorities\uc2 , a left-leaning policy research center, Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's proposals could lift 1.5 million people out of poverty.\par \par \uc2 It is not a bad start. But there is an opportunity for even bolder action. Why not get rid of the child tax credit and the child deduction entirely, and instead provide a monthly check of $250 for every child in the country, to guarantee a minimum level of well-being?\par \par \uc2 ''This is an old idea whose time has come,'' said Timothy Smeeding, a professor at the University of Wisconsin, Madison, who directed the Institute for Research on Poverty there from 2008 to 2014. Daniel P. Moynihan, who advised former President Richard Nixon and was a Democratic senator from New York, actively supported this idea. So did Milton Friedman, the guru of conservative economic thinking from the 1960s through the 1980s.\par \par \uc2 Now the idea is being pitched in a forthcoming article for the Russell Sage Foundation by nine experts on poverty and child well-being including Luke Shaefer from the \uc2 University of Michigan\uc2 , Jane Waldfogel from \uc2 Columbia University\uc2  and Professor Smeeding.\par \par \uc2 The proposal rows against the flow of American policy over the last few decades. The benefit would be universal, like Social Security, rather than aimed at low-income families alone. And it would decouple government assistance from work, a sharp departure from the track followed since the welfare reform of the 1990s, when cash assistance was replaced with tax credits.\par \par \uc2 It offers a better deal than Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's for the poorest families. But more important, it also points the way to rethinking the nation's antipoverty strategy, which allows far too many Americans to fall through the cracks.\par \par \uc2 And it could be a first step to guarantee a modicum of well-being to America's most vulnerable citizens, building a floor below which no one is allowed to fall. That is one of the hallmarks of just about every other advanced nation.\par \par \uc2 ''We might be coming into a moment where there could be some common-sense policy changes,'' Professor Shaefer said. ''There is a policy window that wasn't open a year or two years ago.''\par \par \uc2 Austria, Britain, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway and Sweden all already have some sort of child allowance. In Germany, the benefit for a family with two children adds up to $5,600 a year. In Canada, it is worth $4,935 per child under 6, and $4,164 for children ages 6 to 17.\par \par \uc2 Providing $250 a month a child -- or $3,000 a year -- ''puts us in the ballpark of where our peer countries are,'' Professor Waldfogel said. Provided monthly, rather than annually in a lump sum at tax time as current tax credits are delivered, it would be easier to manage. According to the researchers, it would cut child poverty by over 40 percent and deep poverty by half.\par \par \uc2 It is not even that expensive.\par \par \uc2 Critics will argue that a universal child benefit squanders money on parents who don't need it. Yet many struggling middle-income families could do with the help. For taxpayers in higher brackets, a significant chunk of the benefit would be taxed away, returning it to the Treasury. Best of all, a universal program would avoid the bad incentives of targeted credits, which discourage work because they are phased out as parents' earnings rise.\par \par \uc2 Eliminating the current tax exemptions would pay for much of it. Professor Shaefer and his colleagues estimate that at $250 a month a child (they also offer a few other options), their proposal would cost a little over $190 billion a year. Over half of that could be covered by dropping the child tax credit and the tax deduction, leaving a net price tag of about $90 billion, or about half of 1 percent of the nation's gross domestic product. That's only about $30 billion more than Americans spend on pets.\par \par \uc2 I know, I know. This kind of policy talk sounds crazy in the midst of an \uc2 election\uc2  campaign consumed by reports of sexual assault and outlandish accusations of voter fraud. Even after the \uc2 election\uc2 , I suspect \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , a cautious politician, would balk at trying to persuade Congress to approve a $90 billion price tag for such a plan.\par \par \uc2 And yet the case to help all children start life with equal support from society is powerful. Child poverty is perhaps the United States' most painful failure. The Russell Sage Foundation authors are pointing to a way not just to tinker with the problem, but to start fixing it.\par \par \uc2 Email: eporter@nytimes.com; Twitter: @portereduardo\par \par \uc2 A line for school supplies in Los Angeles.

\par\par \uc2 Business World\par \b \uc2 'Rigged' Was Hillary's \uc2 FBI\uc2  Case\b0\par\par\uc2 By Holman W. Jenkins, Jr.   \par \uc2 808 \uc2 words\par \uc2 19 October 2016\par \uc2 The Wall Street Journal\par \uc2 J\par A11\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  probably is not helping his cause much with his conspiracy-mongering about a "rigged" \uc2 election\uc2  but Democrats should be thankful for small favors.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  lacks message discipline. Instead of scattershot claims that the race is being manipulated, wild conspiracy theories about ballot box-stuffing, which both parties and Americans of decency and goodwill strongly refute, he might be focusing laser-like on the "rigged" argument that nobody can confidently refute.\par \par \uc2 That's the argument that \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  is her party's nominee and on her way to the White House only because the Obama administration decided to waive the law on handling classified material -- and the \uc2 FBI\uc2  went along -- in order to assure that its designated heiress would succeed to the presidency.\par \par \uc2 Google\uc2  says the question "is \uc2 Trump\uc2  trying to lose?" has skyrocketed in popularity in the last few days. Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  is perhaps willing to be president but hasn't been willing to do what was necessary to win. He never seriously tried to expand beyond his core support. He never wanted to spend the money, especially on TV advertising, that would be needed to do so.\par \par \uc2 If, in a deeper realism, he suspected that something like the Billy Bush tape was always going to stand in his way, he was rational to limit his financial risk -- though he did the country no favor by accepting the nomination. In any case, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  is now behaving as we knew he would. The appeal of "rigged" is obvious. It's an argument that can continue to be prosecuted on-air after \uc2 Election\uc2  Day. Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  need not, as losing candidates do, concede defeat and disappear. His son-in-law, we're told by the \uc2 Financial Times\uc2  this week, has already reached out to an investment banker about starting a \uc2 Trump\uc2  TV network after the \uc2 election\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 America, you've been played.\par \par \uc2 If today's Democratic campaign were being fought against a generic Republican without Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's distinct qualities and history, here's what would dominate the news:\par \par \uc2 Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  was verbally convicted by the \uc2 FBI\uc2  chief for mishandling classified information yet somehow not formally charged.\par \par \uc2 Her aides were allowed to cut curious deals with \uc2 FBI\uc2  investigators that effectively swept under the rug any possible charges against them for obstruction or evidence tampering.\par \par \uc2 Those same aides have been revealed, through email leaks, to have freely mixed public and private interests, including their own and \uc2 Clinton\uc2  private interests, in the performance of jobs that, in some cases, saw them receiving salaries from the \uc2 Clinton\uc2  Foundation\uc2  or the \uc2 Clinton\uc2  family even as they also worked for the taxpayer at the State Department.\par \par \uc2 The State Department itself, during Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's time as secretary, operated as an extension of the \uc2 Clinton\uc2  Foundation\uc2  when it came to handling the requests and advancing the interests of important \uc2 Clinton\uc2  Foundation\uc2  donors, some of which were foreign governments.\par \par \uc2 The latest email leak, likely at the hands of Russian hackers, shows the State Department negotiating with the \uc2 FBI\uc2  over the classification status of Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's private emails in search of reducing her legal jeopardy.\par \par \uc2 Here's what we can expect after \uc2 Election\uc2  Day: Democrats will claim that a sweeping victory over Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  is a mandate for policies that were hardly talked about during a campaign focused on the shortcomings of Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's treatment of women. If Democrats don't win the House, Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  will adopt President Obama's strategy of aggressively using executive orders to expand Washington's dominance of the private sector while painting Republicans as obstructionists.\par \par \uc2 Those who reason that Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  and House Speaker \uc2 Paul Ryan\uc2  have histories and temperaments suited to cooperation and see hope for bipartisan progress will be disappointed. Why? Because of the steady drip of email leaks. Because of new information challenging the quality and objectivity of the \uc2 FBI\uc2  investigation.\par \par \uc2 Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , like Nixon in 1972, may not get a honeymoon no matter how big her win. The debate we aren't having in the campaign, we will continue not to have: how to foster a modern state that doesn't metastasize corruption, cronyism, elites helping themselves. There will be no bipartisan action on things that ail the American economy and hold back its growth. All of Washington will be enmeshed in a replay of the Watergate era, inward-looking, destructive, consumed with investigations and score-settling.\par \par \uc2 Of course, much will depend on how the vote for control of Congress goes, and whether Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  has an unsuspected gift for creative political leadership that somehow can give the GOP a stake in her success -- as Mr. Obama so signally failed to do. Pleasant surprises are always possible. Don't bet on one.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=wjco20161019000061"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document J000000020161019ecaj0001i\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw272\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4080\pichgoal600

\par\par \b \uc2 Unions Up the \uc2 Election\uc2  Ante\b0\par\par\uc2 By Brody Mullins, Rebecca Ballhaus and Michelle Hackman   \par \uc2 991 \uc2 words\par \uc2 19 October 2016\par \uc2 The Wall Street Journal\par \uc2 J\par A1\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 PHILADELPHIA -- U.S. labor unions are plowing money into the 2016 elections at an unprecedented rate, largely in an effort to help elect \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  and give Democrats a majority in the Senate.\par \par \uc2 According to the most recent campaign-finance filings, unions spent about $108 million on the elections from January 2015 through the end of August, a 38% jump from the $78 million spent during the same period leading up to the 2012 \uc2 election\uc2 , and nearly double their 2008 total in the same period. Almost 85% of their spending this year has supported Democrats.\par \par \uc2 Almost every large union is spending more than has been seen in modern elections, financing rallies, canvassing efforts and ad campaigns to bolster Democrats. The \uc2 AFL-CIO\uc2  has spent $11.4 million funding outside political groups such as super PACs thus far, up from $5 million at this point in the 2012 \uc2 election\uc2 , according to the nonpartisan \uc2 Center for Responsive Politics\uc2 . The National Education Association has spent $14 million, up from $7.7 million.\par \par \uc2 Unions have put few dollars behind Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's campaign, but two unions, one representing U.S. Border Patrol agents and another representing police officers, have endorsed him in recent months. In a statement announcing the endorsement last month, Chuck Canterbury, the national president of the Fraternal Order of the Police, praised Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's "real commitment to law enforcement" and said he "understands and supports our priorities."\par \par \uc2 The unions' efforts to support Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  are particularly crucial as polling shows white working-class voters -- who often belong to labor unions -- are being drawn to Republican \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2 's campaign message. Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  has a 19-percentage-point advantage among white voters without a college degree, according to a Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll taken from Oct. 10-13.\par \par \uc2 Such voters make up a big section of the vote in important electoral states, including Pennsylvania and Ohio. In the prior presidential \uc2 election\uc2 , a majority of white working class men who belonged to a labor union voted for President \uc2 Barack Obama\uc2 , while those not in a union voted for Republican \uc2 Mitt Romney\uc2 , according to the \uc2 AFL-CIO\uc2 , a union umbrella group.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  "has successfully tapped into the anger and frustration out there among our members," said \uc2 Richard Trumka\uc2 , the president of the AFL-CIO. "But once we give them the facts, his house of cards starts to tumble down pretty quickly."\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 Trump\uc2  campaign didn't respond to a request for comment.\par \par \uc2 The unions' \uc2 election\uc2  activity is accelerating in the final weeks of the campaign. On Saturday, the presidents of three unions -- \uc2 American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees\uc2 , the \uc2 NEA\uc2  and the \uc2 American Federation of Teachers\uc2  -- held a rally in west Philadelphia for Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  and Senate candidate Katie McGinty, a Democrat, before dispatching hundreds of volunteers to go door-to-door in the city's battleground neighborhoods and urge people to vote for Democrats.\par \par \uc2 At a rally in Parma, Ohio, last week, union leaders and elected officials sought to bolster support for Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  among members of the state's building-trades labor unions, who are roughly split between Democrats and Republicans.\par \par \uc2 The speakers praised Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's plan to invest in infrastructure and her pledge to raise the minimum wage, and railed against Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  in blunt terms. They pointed to what they said was Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's pattern of not paying business owners what they said he owed them and criticized his selection of Indiana Gov. Mike Pence, a supporter of so-called right-to-work legislation, as his running mate.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  has said decisions he made as a businessman to maximize profit don't reflect the way he'd make choices if he is elected president.\par \par \uc2 Augie Orozco, a member of the \uc2 International Union of Painters and Allied Trades\uc2 , said he found the rally, hosted by the union super PAC Hard Hats for Hillary, useful because it provided him with talking points to persuade his \uc2 Trump\uc2 -leaning co-workers to support Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 He said his co-workers' support for Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  stemmed from a concern that Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  was more of the "same old."\par \par \uc2 As Mr. Orozco and other union members gathered last week, a super PAC led by the \uc2 AFL-CIO\uc2 , other unions and environmentalist \uc2 Tom Steyer\uc2  dispatched 150 canvassers to talk to voters on Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's behalf.\par \par \uc2 The group, called For Our Future, said it has raised $60 million this \uc2 election\uc2  and has knocked on more than one million doors in Ohio alone.\par \par \uc2 Unions also have been among the biggest supporters of Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's allied super PAC, contributing $11 million to the group through August, according to \uc2 Federal \uc2 Election\uc2  Commission\uc2  records. That includes $2 million each from the \uc2 Laborers' International Union of North America\uc2 , the \uc2 United Brotherhood of Carpenters\uc2  and Joiners and the primary union for plumbers and pipe fitters.\par \par \uc2 Labor leaders say they have found Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  more difficult to sell than her predecessor. Mike Knisley, who runs the local plumbers and pipe fitters union in Lima, Ohio, said he had more success persuading union members to vote for Mr. Obama in the 2012 \uc2 election\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 "I never thought I'd have a harder time selling a white woman candidate than a black candidate, but there you have it," Mr. Knisley said.\par \par \uc2 The unprecedented amount of \uc2 election\uc2  activity by unions reflects the massive stakes for organized labor this year. Union membership across the nation has been declining for years, while Republicans in Congress have launched a series of attacks that would further diminish them.\par \par \uc2 Labor unions are also mindful of the vacancy on the \uc2 U.S. Supreme Court\uc2 . Earlier this year, the court appeared poised to issue a decision that would have allowed members of public-sector unions to opt out of paying compulsory dues in certain states.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=wjco20161019000120"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document J000000020161019ecaj00033\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 A group of the world's leading experts in science, medicine and economics threw their support behind \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  on Tuesday, endorsing the Democratic presidential candidate and arguing that her \uc2 election\uc2  is crucial for safeguarding freedom and preserving a constitutional government.\par \par \uc2 The forceful endorsement came in a letter signed by 70 Nobel laureates hailing from a variety of fields and making the case that Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  is the candidate who best understands the importance of investing in science and technology at a time when the world faces challenges on several fronts. The letter made no mention of \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , but it suggested that policies that show a lack of appreciation of scientific knowledge could damage America's prestige and national security.\par \par \uc2 ''We need a president who will support and advance policies that will enable science and technology to flourish in our country and to provide the basis of important policy decisions,'' they wrote.\par \par \uc2 The Nobel winners included such prominent names such as the chemist \uc2 Peter Agre\uc2 , the economist Robert J. Shiller and the physicist Robert Woodrow Wilson. They pointed to global concerns such as cancer, Alzheimer's disease and climate change as problems that require American investment and innovation.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  has described climate change as a ''hoax'' perpetrated by China.\par \par \uc2 The fact that the Nobel laureates are backing Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  does not come as a big surprise, as academics overwhelmingly tend to lean Democratic.\par \par \uc2 In 2012, 68 winners of the prize backed President Obama over \uc2 Mitt Romney\uc2 . Four years earlier, 76 winners supported Mr. Obama over Senator \uc2 John McCain\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 This year, the group of luminaries made clear that the stakes of the \uc2 election\uc2  are especially high.\par \par \uc2 ''The coming presidential \uc2 election\uc2  will have profound consequences for the future of our country and the world,'' they wrote.\par \par \uc2 Find out what you need to know about the 2016 presidential race today, and get politics news updates via \uc2 Facebook\uc2 , \uc2 Twitter\uc2  and the First Draft newsletter.\par \par \uc2 Document NYTF000020161019ecaj000bb\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 National Desk; SECT\par \b \uc2 At Previous Debates, Melania \uc2 Trump\uc2  and \uc2 Bill \uc2 Clinton\uc2  Shook Hands. Not Anymore.\b0\par\par\uc2 By JEREMY W. PETERS and MAGGIE HABERMAN \par \uc2 749 \uc2 words\par \uc2 19 October 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 The New York Times on the Web\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 This intensely antagonistic \uc2 election\uc2  has shattered another quaint campaign ritual: the handshakes between opposing candidates' family members before a debate.\par \par \uc2 At previous debates, former President \uc2 Bill \uc2 Clinton\uc2  has shaken the hand of Melania \uc2 Trump\uc2  -- and sometimes the hands of the children of \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2  -- as part of the predebate protocol.\par \par \uc2 It provides the audience in the room, and the people watching at home, with a moment of graciousness and a touch of celebrity.\par \par \uc2 But for the final debate, \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's campaign wants a different setup, according to two people with direct knowledge of the situation who requested anonymity to speak candidly about debate negotiations.\par \par \uc2 That's because at the previous debate, on Oct. 9 in St. Louis, the \uc2 Trump\uc2  campaign had an elaborate plan to parade three women who accused Mr. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  of sexual assault and rape into the family seating area and force Mr. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  to shake their hands as he crossed the room.\par \par \uc2 Had the \uc2 Trump\uc2  campaign succeeded, Mr. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  would have come face-to-face with the women on national television, a potentially humiliating and excruciating encounter. However, the \uc2 Commission on Presidential Debates\uc2  intervened, and the women -- Juanita Broaddrick, Paula Jones and Kathleen Willey -- never came close to Mr. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 But the \uc2 Clinton\uc2  side is not taking any chances at the final presidential debate, on Wednesday night in Las Vegas, and has apparently gained approval of a different protocol for the entry of the candidates' spouses and families into the debate hall.\par \par \uc2 The new arrangement calls for the candidates' spouses to enter the hall closer to their seats, rather than crossing the room, and each other's paths.\par \par \uc2 That would avoid any potential for confrontations, given Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's penchant for dramatic stunts.\par \par \uc2 On Tuesday, an aide to Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  declined to comment on the change, and aides to Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  did not respond to an email seeking comment.\par \par \uc2 It is possible, of course, that further negotiations could result in a different arrangement, if both sides agree, by the time the debate begins at 9 p.m. Eastern.\par \par \uc2 But the unease over how the candidates' families interact echoes that of the candidates themselves. At the debate in St. Louis, in a striking departure from tradition, Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  and Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  did not shake hands at the start, though they did at the conclusion of the 90 minutes.\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 Clinton\uc2  campaign is bracing for other possible \uc2 Trump\uc2  surprises at the debate, which seem more likely as the Republican nominee slips further in the polls.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's aides are preparing him with a sharp escalation in attacks on Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's character and a focus on her health, according to a senior campaign adviser, who spoke on the condition of anonymity.\par \par \uc2 On Sunday, in a debate prep session at his golf club in Bedminster, N.J., Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  sparred with \uc2 Gov. Chris Christie\uc2 , who informally played the role of Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , according to a second senior adviser, who also requested anonymity to share details of internal campaign activities.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Christie helped sharpen Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  for his last debate performance, helping him to more aggressively and coherently attack Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  over her use of a private email server, the adviser said. This time, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's advisers are preparing lines related to Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's health, which Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  has sought to make an issue of after her bout of pneumonia in September.\par \par \uc2 At his rallies, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  tends to highlight any time that Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  spends off the campaign trail. He has seized on her days off in the past week as evidence of frailty, though she used much of the time to prepare for the debate and hold private fund-raising events.\par \par \uc2 On Tuesday, according to a person briefed on the plan, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  intends to bring President Obama's half brother, Malik Obama, a \uc2 Trump\uc2  supporter, to the debate.\par \par \uc2 Aides to Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , who seemed rattled but who did not flinch last time as her husband's accusers sat in the debate hall, insisted she was prepared for whatever happens.\par \par \uc2 ''Whatever scorched-earth tactics he has planned for the debate, we will be ready and she will be unfazed,'' said Brian Fallon, a spokesman for Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Find out what you need to know about the 2016 presidential race today, and get politics news updates via \uc2 Facebook\uc2 , \uc2 Twitter\uc2  and the First Draft newsletter.\par \par \uc2 Document NYTF000020161019ecaj000bd\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 Politics; SECT\par \b \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2 , Honing Outsider Message, Backs Term Limits for Congress\b0\par\par\uc2 By ASHLEY PARKER \par \uc2 855 \uc2 words\par \uc2 19 October 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 The New York Times on the Web\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 COLORADO SPRINGS -- \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2  called for congressional term limits during a swing out West on Tuesday, part of an effort to push a raw outsider message in the closing weeks of the presidential campaign.\par \par \uc2 In a speech here that aides had hoped would focus his populist, anti-Washington appeal -- to ''drain the swamp'' of the nation's capital, a phrase Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  repeated several times -- he turned only cursorily, near the middle of his remarks, to what was supposed to be the day's new policy proposal.\par \par \uc2 ''The time for congressional term limits has finally arrived,'' Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  said, after promising to push for a constitutional amendment to impose term limits on congressional lawmakers. ''Not only will it end our government corruption, but we will end the economic stagnation that we are in right now.''\par \par \uc2 At a second rally in Colorado, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  added specificity, saying he would limit House lawmakers to three terms, or six years, and senators to two terms, or 12 years.\par \par \uc2 In his speech here, a solidly Republican city, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  did not respond to President Obama's taunt earlier in the day that he ''stop whining'' about a ''rigged'' \uc2 election\uc2  and instead focus on making his case to voters.\par \par \uc2 But he also did not exactly heed Mr. Obama's advice to stop complaining, instead lamenting again what he called the rigged news media, disavowing the polls that have recently showed him slipping further behind \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  in Colorado and other battleground states, and mocking his Democratic rival's health.\par \par \uc2 ''As \uc2 WikiLeaks\uc2  proved, the media really is just an extension of the \uc2 Clinton\uc2  campaign,'' Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  said as the crowd booed. ''The press has created a rigged system and poisoned the mind of so many of our voters. They have rigged it from the beginning by telling totally false stories, most recently about phony allegations, where I have been under constant attack.''\par \par \uc2 And Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  again returned to his unsubstantiated claims of an \uc2 election\uc2  ''stolen'' through voter fraud, singling out, with no evidence, black communities as the likely culprits.\par \par \uc2 ''Voter fraud is all too common, and then they criticize us for saying that,'' he said. ''But take a look at Philadelphia, what's been going on. Take a look at Chicago. Take a look at St. Louis. Take a look at some of these cities, where you see things happening that are horrendous.''\par \par \uc2 He added, ''And if you talk about it, they say bad things about you, they call you a racist.''\par \par \uc2 In Grand Junction, Colo., Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  was more explicit, saying he expected his supporters to engage in poll watching, a practice that Democrats and Republicans have worried could amount to voter intimidation.\par \par \uc2 After briefly pulling roughly even with Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  here at the end of September, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  has fallen in the polls in Colorado; he trails Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  by 11 points in the state in a new head-to-head \uc2 Quinnipiac University\uc2  poll, and the Real Clear Politics polling average on Tuesday showed her leading Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  by eight points here, 46 percent to 38 percent.\par \par \uc2 Seeming to acknowledge his increasingly challenging political reality, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  -- who once frequently cited favorable polls to his crowds -- sounded a sour note. ''Even though we're doing pretty well in the polls, I don't believe the polls anymore, I don't believe them,'' he said. ''Believe me, folks, we're doing great.''\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's two stops in the state were in staunchly Republican areas, part of Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's now default strategy of trying to mobilize every single base voter who helped lift him to his party's nomination.\par \par \uc2 After controversies over his treatment of women, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  and his aides have all but abandoned trying to win over undecided or independent voters, and are instead working to depress Democratic turnout through increasingly aggressive attacks on Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Nonetheless, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's team seems determined to show he can compete in Colorado, where Hispanics, many of whom view the Republican nominee unfavorably, could play a pivotal role. Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  also faces a significant gender gap, and suburban women, especially outside Denver, could pose a challenge.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  has spent $1.9 million on television ads in the state, with $2.5 million more booked through \uc2 Election\uc2  Day. The \uc2 National Rifle Association\uc2  has helped with about $750,000 more, according to a Republican firm that tracks media buying. In contrast, the \uc2 Clinton\uc2  campaign put ads up in Colorado early with $2 million, and has since been supplemented by Priorities USA, a ''super PAC'' supporting her, which has spent $6 million, with an additional $1 million reserved through \uc2 Election\uc2  Day.\par \par \uc2 In Colorado Springs, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  also offered some unsolicited advice to his supporters, which could double, at times, for his own campaign mantra: ''Forget the press. Read the internet. Study other things,'' he said. ''Don't go for the mainstream media.''\par \par \uc2 Find out what you need to know about the 2016 presidential race today, and get politics news updates via \uc2 Facebook\uc2 , \uc2 Twitter\uc2  and the First Draft newsletter.\par \par \uc2 Document NYTF000020161019ecaj000bc\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

Toomey of Pennsylvania face difficult re-\uc2 election\uc2  battles.\par \par \uc2 The move is a new phase for Priorities. Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's lead over Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  has allowed the group to focus on down-ballot races.\par \par \uc2 This week it will also begin airing television and radio ads in Georgia, a reliably Republican-leaning state that polls show may be in play in the presidential race.\par \par \uc2 ''Our first priority is doing all we can to help Hillary win in as many places, among as many people and by as big a margin as possible,'' Guy Cecil, the chief strategist for Priorities, said in an emailed statement. But Mr. Cecil, the former executive director of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, said the group hopes to add to the ranks of Democrats working with her in Congress.\par \par \uc2 Find out what you need to know about the 2016 presidential race today, and get politics news updates via \uc2 Facebook\uc2 , \uc2 Twitter\uc2  and the First Draft newsletter.\par \par \uc2 Document NYTF000020161019ecaj000ba\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 OP-ED CONTRIBUTOR\par \uc2 OpEd; SECT\par \b \uc2 The Religious Right's \uc2 Trump\uc2  Schism\b0\par\par\uc2 By SARAH POSNER \par \uc2 1,202 \uc2 words\par \uc2 19 October 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 The New York Times on the Web\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2  had already roiled the religious right, casting the Republican Party's most reliable voting bloc into an abyss of despair, recriminations and uncertainty about the future. Then the 2005 video surfaced of him boasting about his sexual predations and women began coming forward to accuse him of sexual assault.\par \par \uc2 ''The world is getting a glimpse into the dark and rotting core of evangelicalism,'' an evangelical with deep roots in the movement told me recently.\par \par \uc2 The divide -- or, more aptly, the crater -- between pro-\uc2 Trump\uc2  and anti-\uc2 Trump\uc2  evangelicals is a window into the future of the Republican Party. White evangelical voters are the heart of the party's base, the loyal foot soldiers who turn out for the party's presidential nominee every time. A poll by the Public Religion Research Institute taken in part after the video's release shows 65 percent of white evangelicals intending to vote for Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 . That is high enough to be significant, but is relatively low for evangelical voters and the Republican nominee. (For comparison, \uc2 Mitt Romney\uc2 , who was viewed with suspicion by many evangelicals because he is Mormon, won the votes of 79 percent of white evangelicals.) Most telling, though, is the significant gender gap: while 72 percent of white evangelical men said they intend to vote for Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , only 58 percent of white evangelical women did.\par \par \uc2 A defection by even 15 percent or 20 percent of Republican evangelicals from lock-step support for the party could be a major contributing factor to a collapse of the its national electoral viability. But that is just one measure of the splintering of this devoted voting bloc. The movement is also being subjected to a very public display of division between the pro- and anti-\uc2 Trump\uc2  camps and open talk among evangelicals about pro-\uc2 Trump\uc2  leaders' plummeting credibility.\par \par \uc2 The Monday after America heard Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's vulgar boasting, \uc2 Ralph Reed\uc2 , the political strategist thought to have a genius for turning out evangelical voters, delivered a full-throated defense of why Christians should vote for the nominee to students at \uc2 Liberty University\uc2 . That same day, Mark DeMoss, a highly regarded Christian public relations professional who, in the 1980s, was the chief of staff to Liberty's founder, \uc2 Jerry Falwell Sr\uc2 ., told me, ''The evangelical movement has, in my view, forfeited any future moral authority in American public life.'' Mr. DeMoss, himself a \uc2 Liberty\uc2  alumnus, was asked to resign from the university board's executive committee in February after he was publicly critical of the endorsement of Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  by Liberty's president, \uc2 Jerry Falwell Jr\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 That was just the beginning of what has become an evangelical schism over Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 . This month, Wayne Grudem, a theologian highly respected by evangelicals, rescinded his endorsement. Andy Crouch, executive editor of Christianity Today, wrote, ''Enthusiasm for a candidate like \uc2 Trump\uc2  gives our neighbors ample reason to doubt that we believe Jesus is Lord.'' James MacDonald, a pastor who had agreed to serve on Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's Evangelical Executive Advisory Council, called Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  ''lecherous and worthless'' and the council ''a joke.''\par \par \uc2 Mr. Falwell, though, has stood by Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , telling \uc2 WABC Radio\uc2  that ''we're all sinners'' and accusing ''Republican establishment members'' of a conspiracy to release the tape so they could ''slither out'' of their endorsements. Yet the reaction of a group of \uc2 Liberty\uc2  students provided another data point in the unfolding evangelical power collapse. The students released a letter declaring that Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  ''is absolutely opposed to what we believe, and does not have our support.''\par \par \uc2 As Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  takes the stage for the final debate on Wednesday night, evangelical women may well be thinking less about the male leadership's defense of Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  and more about the words of the popular evangelical speaker and writer Beth Moore, who tweeted this month: ''I'm one among many women sexually abused, misused, stared down, heckled, talked naughty to. Like we liked it. We didn't. We're tired of it.''\par \par \uc2 Although its leaders may not admit it, the political apparatus of the religious right that has persisted in supporting Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's candidacy is driven by a quest to retain a seat at a potential Republican White House table.\par \par \uc2 But capitulating to Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  has stripped those leaders of their leverage. In previous elections, they vetted the candidates, dangling the indispensable evangelical vote in exchange for promises about Supreme Court justices and dedication to ''Christian values.'' Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  reversed that dynamic. He has offered the most perfunctory promises of Supreme Court nominations and ''pro-life'' principles, but rarely talks about their major issues, particularly religious freedom. His most Trumpian promise is his pledge to repeal the Johnson Amendment, a rarely enforced law that bars houses of worship and other nonprofit groups from using tax-exempt resources to endorse political candidates.\par \par \uc2 For evangelical leaders who are backing Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , even a good-news scenario -- the surveys are wrong and he wins -- carries risk. Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  could fail to follow through on his promises to the religious right, the leaders who endorsed him will suffer diminished standing and their organizations could face difficulties in fund-raising. If he loses, though, there could be a showdown in which the pro-\uc2 Trump\uc2  camp blames the anti-Trumpers for the loss, and the anti-\uc2 Trump\uc2  camp is still seething that it was asked to compromise principles for party loyalty.\par \par \uc2 ''It will take a long time,'' Jerushah Armfield, an evangelical writer and the granddaughter of the iconic evangelist \uc2 Billy Graham\uc2 , told me, ''for evangelicals to redeem their moral credibility -- if they even can.''\par \par \uc2 There remains one thing that could still unite conservative evangelicals: a Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  presidency. It's still entirely foreseeable that the religious right, along with other pro-\uc2 Trump\uc2  partisans, would fight Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's legislative agenda, her Supreme Court nominees and even the legitimacy of her \uc2 election\uc2 . A recent poll showed that 68 percent of white evangelicals found Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's call to jail Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  ''appropriate.'' Antipathy for Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  runs deep: In 1994, Mr. Falwell Sr. helped foment the \uc2 Bill \uc2 Clinton\uc2  impeachment fight, marketing a film that accused Mr. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  of sexual misdeeds and even murder. Back then, Mr. Falwell sold the videotapes for $43 each. Today, conspiracy theories proliferate freely on the internet.\par \par \uc2 By hitching their wagon to Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , religious-right leaders are also tying their fortunes to the alt-right, the predominant movement supportive of, and bolstered by, the \uc2 Trump\uc2  campaign. As a largely secular movement, though, the alt-right not only is uninterested in the religious right's concerns, it also threatens to eclipse the religious right within the Republican Party. And it's a movement simmering with racism, xenophobia and anti-Semitism.\par \par \uc2 The religious right has told us for decades that the moral downfall of America is imminent, and only God can save us. It may finally be proven right.\par \par \uc2 Follow The \uc2 New York Times\uc2  Opinion section on \uc2 Facebook\uc2  and \uc2 Twitter\uc2  (@NYTOpinion), and sign up for the Opinion Today newsletter.\par \par \uc2 Sarah Posner is the author of ''God's Profits: Faith, Fraud and the Republican Crusade for Values Voters.''\par \par \uc2 Document NYTF000020161019ecaj0008s\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 OP-ED COLUMNIST\par \uc2 OpEd; SECT\par \b \uc2 The \uc2 Trump\uc2  Afterlife\b0\par\par\uc2 By ROSS DOUTHAT \par \uc2 1,116 \uc2 words\par \uc2 19 October 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 The New York Times on the Web\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 We are in the last days of \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2 , presidential candidate. But as his defeat becomes more assured, the anxiety about his political afterlife is mounting. Liberals fear a world where he refuses to concede and his supporters turn to violence. Conservatives fear a world where the Republican Party remains imprisoned in his short-fingered grasp. Fox News executives fear a world where \uc2 Trump\uc2  starts a cable channel and steals their audience out from under them. And his supporters imagine that like a populist Obi-Wan Kenobi, he will rise more powerful than before.\par \par \uc2 There is no question that \uc2 Trump\uc2  will haunt the country, and especially the Republican Party, long after the votes are counted on Nov. 8. But the \uc2 Trump\uc2  phenomenon will not sustain itself automatically at anything like this scale, and there are ways in which \uc2 Trump\uc2  could fade into the celebrity-industrial background of our culture rather more swiftly than many people think.\par \par \uc2 Start with the worst-case scenario for the \uc2 election\uc2 , from the point of view of civics and civil peace: \uc2 Trump\uc2  refuses to concede defeat, rants about voter fraud, denounces Republican officialdom for betraying him, and urges his supporters to storm polling places and take to the streets. It's possible to imagine this message leading to spasms of violence, and thence to a future of armed clashes between Trumpist militias and left-wing protesters like the ones who flooded \uc2 Trump\uc2 's Chicago rally earlier this year. (The Week's Damon Linker imagines something along these apocalyptic lines in a recent column.)\par \par \uc2 But if \uc2 Trump\uc2  loses in three weeks by the largest landslide in post-Reagan political history, it's also possible that such a ''to the barricades'' rant could look a bit, well, ridiculous even to his deepest-dyed supporters. Not that some of them won't embrace conspiracy theories and cheer on a Trumperdammerung online. But it's not clear that the keyboard warfare and Twitter anti-Semitism of some of \uc2 Trump\uc2 's supporters translate into a widespread appetite for flesh-and-blood confrontations with either law enforcement or the left.\par \par \uc2 Yes, his rallies have been ugly, but there's a big difference between sucker-punching a protester when you're in the midst of a like-minded crowd and a street fight, Weimar-style, with people who might punch or shoot back. The only time a \uc2 Trump\uc2  rally almost turned into a riot was in the Chicago case, when it was anti-\uc2 Trump\uc2  activists more than the rallygoers who seemed to come spoiling for a fight; the most recent act of actual \uc2 election\uc2 -year violence was a firebombing of a \uc2 Trump\uc2  campaign headquarters by persons unknown.\par \par \uc2 The Republican nominee's base is senior citizens, not the testosterone-addled young. How many of them are actually ready to rumble at Roger Stone's command? If the answer is ''not very many,'' then you could easily imagine \uc2 Trump\uc2  overplaying his hand in an anti-concession speech, and inadvertently revealing that his right-wing populism is more virtual, more reality-television, than the 1930s variety.\par \par \uc2 This may explain the appeal of a postelection pivot back into the virtual, in the form of some kind of \uc2 Trump\uc2  TV. And again, it's possible to imagine a darkly influential trajectory for such a network, in which it dominates the conservative entertainment landscape, race-baits and stirs outrage nightly, and so terrifies Republicans that Washington becomes more ungovernable than ever. \uc2 Silvio Berlusconi\uc2 , \uc2 Trump\uc2 's Italian counterpart, used TV dominance as a springboard into political power; perhaps \uc2 Trump\uc2  can use a start-up network as a place to park his ambitions and his audience until 2020 rolls around.\par \par \uc2 Except that building a TV network from scratch is a tough job (even if you poach Sean Hannity as your Caesar Flickerman), and the kind of project that tends to require a substantial upfront investment (not words that \uc2 Trump\uc2  likes to hear). Unlike Fox News when it started, \uc2 Trump\uc2  wouldn't be filling a gaping right-of-center void; he'd be trying to cannibalize part of the Fox audience, swiping its Hannity demographic and adding in some InfoWars viewers, which would mean competing in a very crowded landscape for not-exactly-certain returns.\par \par \uc2 So \uc2 Trump\uc2  TV might make more sense, as Derek Thompson of The Atlantic and others have pointed out, as a subscription service -- a paid digital TV network (with a Breitbart-ish website attached) along the lines of Glenn Beck's up-and-down experiment The Blaze. But under that model, even if it succeeded as a financial proposition, \uc2 Trump\uc2  would be forfeiting the hope of anything close to Fox-size viewership for his nightly fireside chats; he would risk becoming a niche celebrity even within the conservative firmament, which might be fatal to any permanent ''leader of the opposition'' ambitions.\par \par \uc2 Here Beck's example is instructive: When he left Fox for The Blaze, he went from being the leading Wild Man of the histrionic anti-Obama right to being just one conservative media personality among many. (In fairness, he also mellowed considerably.) Another instructive example is \uc2 Sarah Palin\uc2 , who went from icon to afterthought fairly quickly following the 2008 campaign.\par \par \uc2 Trump\uc2  is far bigger than Beck and far more media-savvy than Palin; he's sustained his own celebrity for a very long time. But sustaining power is a different matter, requiring different strengths.\par \par \uc2 If \uc2 Trump\uc2  really wanted to bestride the post-2016 G.O.P. like an orange colossus, neither \uc2 Trump\uc2  militias nor \uc2 Trump\uc2  TV are the natural path. Instead, he would be better served behaving like, well, a semi-normal political leader -- deploying himself as the voice of Trumpism on the existing cable networks, finding or recruiting a set of younger politicians to carry the Trumpist banner in 2018, supporting efforts to fund-raise and build out the infrastructure for a Trumpist equivalent of the netroots or the Tea Party, and (since he's not getting any younger) auditioning a smoother political apprentice to fill his shoes in 2020.\par \par \uc2 And the fact that exactly none of these sound like the \uc2 Trump\uc2  we know so well is the best reason to suspect that he won't be as influential over the next four years as a lot of people fear. The things that would really maximize his influence, like the things that would have made him a competitive presidential candidate in 2016, are all things that he may be temperamentally incapable of doing.\par \par \uc2 I invite you to follow me on Twitter (@DouthatNYT).\par \par \uc2 Follow The \uc2 New York Times\uc2  Opinion section on \uc2 Facebook\uc2  and Twitter (@NYTopinion), and sign up for the Opinion Today newsletter.\par \par \uc2 Document NYTF000020161019ecaj0008i\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 National Desk; SECTA\par \b \uc2 Keys to Debate: \uc2 Trump\uc2 's Brand, \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's Tone, and Sexual Harassment\b0\par\par\uc2 By JONATHAN MARTIN and ALEXANDER BURNS \par \uc2 1,140 \uc2 words\par \uc2 19 October 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 11\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2  has had possibly the most dismal October of any presidential nominee in recent history -- and the month is just more than half over. Facing accusations of sexual harassment and criticism for vulgar and demeaning comments toward women, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  limps into Wednesday's debate, the final one against \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , with polls showing him losing in nearly every state he must win.\par \par \uc2 Much can happen in politics over three weeks, and this \uc2 election\uc2  has been full of surprises. But by lashing out at the news media; criticizing Speaker Paul D. Ryan, his party's highest-ranking official; and claiming without evidence that the electoral system is ''rigged,'' Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  appears less intent on finding a path to victory than on grasping for scapegoats to explain away an eventual loss.\par \par \uc2 How he and Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  approach the debate in Las Vegas will go a long way in determining just how sordid the remainder of this race will be -- and how difficult the healing process will be once it ends. Here are a few of the things we will be watching:\par \par \uc2 Is Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  worried about his brand?\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  is already the most disliked presidential nominee in the history of polling, and his reputation is unlikely to recover if he continues to peddle conspiracy theories about \uc2 election\uc2  fraud and mock the looks of the women who have accused him of sexual assault. Another slashing performance against Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  could push away even more undecided voters -- though at this point there may be few swing voters left for Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  to alienate.\par \par \uc2 But if he has little left to lose as a politician, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  still has significant interests at stake in the race. Many of his business ventures depend on the value of his personal brand, and at some point, he may feel pressure -- from family members and business partners -- to protect his investments by tempering his machine-gunner's instincts.\par \par \uc2 There's been no evidence of such restraint from Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , however, and a do-or-die debate may be an unlikely moment for him to shift in that direction.\par \par \uc2 Can Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  find the right tone?\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  is not the only one confronting a stark choice about how to proceed. With her campaign expanding to compete in traditionally Republican-leaning states and her advantage growing in most of the battlegrounds, Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  is well positioned as the race enters its final days. Because Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  is now so heavily favored to win, the debate offers an opportunity for her to start looking beyond the \uc2 election\uc2  and toward unifying a country that has been divided by an ugly campaign.\par \par \uc2 After praising \uc2 Michelle Obama\uc2 's ''when they go low, we go high'' credo, Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  now has a chance to turn that advice into action. And doing so would not simply be an exercise in high-mindedness to win plaudits from centrist commentators. By vowing to represent all Americans after the \uc2 election\uc2 , including Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's supporters, she can also disarm an opponent who relishes confrontation but has little aptitude for conciliation.\par \par \uc2 Will Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  torch his own party?\par \par \uc2 Snubbed by Mr. Ryan in the final month of the campaign, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  has seemed as eager to attack turncoat leaders in his own party as to make the case against Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 . He has reserved special venom for Mr. Ryan, blasting him as a weak leader with bad ideas about trade and immigration, and suggesting that Mr. Ryan might be sabotaging Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's campaign to pave the way for a presidential run of his own in four years.\par \par \uc2 These attacks have the potential to rip apart the Republican Party in ways that will last long beyond \uc2 Election\uc2  Day. Should Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  use a prime-time debate to sic the Republican base on its leaders -- and to cast himself, essentially, as an independent candidate challenging elites on the left and right -- he could inflict damage on the party far deeper than what Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  might deliver on her own.\par \par \uc2 And should Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  strafe the party that nominated him, it could have immediate consequences for Republicans seeking \uc2 election\uc2  to the House and Senate, who cannot afford an abrupt drop in turnout from demoralized and angry voters in their own camp.\par \par \uc2 Will Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  seek to reposition herself?\par \par \uc2 Republicans have been overjoyed that the \uc2 WikiLeaks\uc2  hacks of Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's private speeches and the email account of her campaign chairman have offered new fodder against her, or have at least diverted attention from Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's inflammatory campaign. But the revelations to date have done more to confirm the suspicions of those on the far left than those on the far right: Namely, that she is a cautious, at times plotting, left-of-center Democrat given more to pragmatism than purity.\par \par \uc2 Now that she is comfortably ahead in blue America and making incursions into conservative redoubts like Arizona and Utah, will Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  flash some of the centrism she has displayed in private? She is unlikely, for example, to suddenly reverse course on her opposition to the Trans-Pacific Partnership, or pledge to enact Simpson-Bowles, the moribund deficit-reduction plan. But with Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  veering into the realm of the conspiratorial, the debate offers her the chance to reach out to moderates and even some Republicans unwilling to support their nominee but still uneasy about her.\par \par \uc2 Will sexual assault dominate the debate?\par \par \uc2 After a week's worth of sexual assault and harassment accusations against Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , there may be moments that feel more like a courtroom drama than a conventional presidential debate. Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  has never convincingly rebutted the numerous stories from women who say he groped them without consent. On the contrary, he has veered from ridiculing his accusers to asserting flatly, and falsely, that their stories have been debunked.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  struggled in the second debate to address questions raised by an 11-year-old recording in which he boasted of pushing himself on women. He faces a far tougher challenge now, as the allegations against him have grown and polls show the great majority of voters siding with his accusers.\par \par \uc2 So far, Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  has held back from attacking Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  aggressively on this front, allowing other Democrats, like Mrs. Obama, to lead the charge. That approach is unlikely to carry through the debate.\par \par \uc2 Find out what you need to know about the 2016 presidential race today, and get politics news updates via \uc2 Facebook\uc2 , \uc2 Twitter\uc2  and the First Draft newsletter.\par \par \uc2 Stand-ins for the presidential debate during preparations at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas.

\par\par \uc2 EDITORIAL\par \uc2 Editorial Desk; SECTA\par \b \uc2 The Rap Sheet Against Sheriff Arpaio\b0\par\par\uc2 By THE EDITORIAL BOARD \par \uc2 538 \uc2 words\par \uc2 19 October 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 22\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 A thorough moral and political indictment of Sheriff Joe Arpaio of Maricopa County, Ariz., would spill far beyond this page. It would catalog the years of racial profiling, the tormenting of immigrants and Latinos, the physical mistreatment and humiliation of inmates and defendants, the beatings and neglect and deaths behind bars, the abuses of office -- withholding records, harassing and persecuting elected officials and journalists, failing to investigate hundreds of unsolved sex crimes, squandering taxpayer funds on crime sweeps and ''posses'' and looney-tune vendettas, like the mission to expose President Obama's supposedly forged birth certificate.\par \par \uc2 The actual criminal indictment that he faces is a lot simpler. On Monday, federal officials charged him with contempt of court. If the sheriff is found guilty at a misdemeanor level, he could go to prison for six months.\par \par \uc2 The federal judge in a long-running racial-profiling lawsuit had told Sheriff Arpaio and his chief deputy in 2011 to stop abusing Latinos by pulling them over on suspicion of being in the country illegally, in the absence of any other charges. That is, for the sheriff to stop acting as a federal immigration agency unto himself.\par \par \uc2 This the sheriff did not do, according to the indictment.\par \par \uc2 Sheriff Arpaio, who is running for a seventh term, says he is innocent. He insists he won't give up, won't take a plea deal, won't resign. In an unsurprising play at victimhood, he accused the feds of ''a blatant abuse of power,'' of applying a different standard of justice to a lonely lawman who, in his words, ''dares enforce the rule of law.''\par \par \uc2 Does he think the government is that stupid? Sheriff Arpaio's record of lawlessness speaks for itself; to grasp its enormity visit the website of \uc2 the American Civil Liberties Union\uc2 , a party to the racial-profiling lawsuit, or review the reporting by the newspaper in Mesa, Ariz., that won a Pulitzer Prize in 2009. ''Contempt'' is a fitting word for this long-overdue prosecution -- not just contempt for the court, but for the people, for civil order, for justice.\par \par \uc2 That is the reason Sheriff Arpaio is a hero to Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2 , who is running to rid the country of Mexican ''rapists'' and refugee ''terrorists.'' Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  has promised a regime of racist policing that terrorizes immigrants and their families. What Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  envisions, Sheriff Arpaio embodies.\par \par \uc2 The Arpaio trial is to begin in December, after the \uc2 election\uc2 . If Maricopa County's voters finally wake up -- and a recent poll hints at the possibility -- the sheriff will be voted out of office. If convicted, he will be punished, but probably not as harshly as he has punished and demeaned those in his custody. He will not be marched in shackles and prison stripes through the streets of Phoenix, for TV cameras; he will not be issued pink underwear and fed rancid meat. He will not be confined outdoors in suffocating heat. For his many thousands of victims, his humiliation in court will have to be enough.\par \par \uc2 Follow The \uc2 New York Times\uc2  Opinion section on \uc2 Facebook\uc2  and \uc2 Twitter\uc2  (@NYTOpinion), and sign up for the Opinion Today newsletter.\par \par \uc2 Document NYTF000020161019ecaj0006j\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Julian Assange, the \uc2 WikiLeaks\uc2  founder, has lost some of his guest privileges at the Ecuadorean Embassy in London. After shielding the Australian anti-secrecy activist for more than four years from potential prosecution in Sweden, where he faces sexual assault charges, Ecuador cut off Mr. Assange's access to the internet over the weekend, according to \uc2 WikiLeaks\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 In a tweet, \uc2 WikiLeaks\uc2  said Secretary of State \uc2 John Kerry\uc2  pressured Ecuador's foreign minister last month to prevent Mr. Assange from disclosing more emails involving \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 . A State Department spokesman called the allegation ''simply untrue.''\par \par \uc2 The Ecuadorean government confirmed it had restricted internet access at the embassy, saying it ''respects the principle of nonintervention in the internal affairs of other states.'' It also said Mr. Assange's asylum status was unchanged. When Quito offered him refuge in June 2012, the government of President Rafael Correa saw an opportunity to rankle Washington, which he and other leftist leaders accuse of undermining their socialist governments. But relations between the United States and Ecuador have warmed up somewhat in recent years.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Correa's government noted that it limited internet access after \uc2 WikiLeaks\uc2  released ''a wealth of documents impacting on the U.S. \uc2 election\uc2  campaign.'' They were hundreds of emails from the personal account of \uc2 John Podesta\uc2 , Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's campaign chief, including many innocuous exchanges.\par \par \uc2 In a recent interview, Mr. Correa said a \uc2 Trump\uc2  presidency would be better for Latin America, noting that it was during the administration of George W. Bush when populist leaders in several countries rose to power and banded together to repudiate America's arrogant approach to foreign policy. That said, he also allowed that if he were American, he'd vote for Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 . ''I know her personally and I have great appreciation for her,'' he said. ''For the good of the United States and the good of the world, I'd want Hillary to win.''\par \par \uc2 Follow The \uc2 New York Times\uc2  Opinion section on \uc2 Facebook\uc2  and \uc2 Twitter\uc2  (@NYTOpinion), and sign up for the Opinion Today newsletter.\par \par \uc2 Document NYTF000020161019ecaj0006k\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 National Desk; SECTA\par \b \uc2 Few Answering Call by \uc2 Trump\uc2  to Watch Polls\b0\par\par\uc2 By TRIP GABRIEL; Mark Landler contributed reporting from Washington, and Ashley Parker from Colorado Springs. \par \uc2 1,261 \uc2 words\par \uc2 19 October 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 1\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Warning darkly of a stolen \uc2 election\uc2 , \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2  has called on supporters to turn out in droves on \uc2 Election\uc2  Day to monitor polling places, telling them they need to be vigilant against widespread voter fraud and a rigged outcome.\par \par \uc2 ''Voter fraud is all too common, and then they criticize us for saying that,'' he said at a rally Tuesday in Colorado Springs. ''But take a look at Philadelphia, what's been going on, take a look at Chicago, take a look at St. Louis. Take a look at some of these cities, where you see things happening that are horrendous.''\par \par \uc2 His language has stirred increasing fears of intimidation of minorities inside polling places, where their qualifications to vote could be challenged, or outside, where they would face illegal electioneering.\par \par \uc2 But as Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  casts doubt on the integrity of the presidential \uc2 election\uc2 , there are no signs of a wave of \uc2 Trump\uc2  poll watchers building. Like much else about his campaign, his call to ''get everybody to go out and watch'' the polls seems to be a Potemkin effort, with little or no organization behind it.\par \par \uc2 Still, his pronouncements about a ''stolen'' \uc2 election\uc2  were enough to draw a mocking rebuke Tuesday from President Obama, who suggested that Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's effort to delegitimize the \uc2 election\uc2  results even before the vote takes place was unprecedented. He told the Republican nominee to ''stop whining and go try to make his case to get votes.''\par \par \uc2 ''I have never seen in my lifetime or in modern political history any presidential candidate trying to discredit the elections and the \uc2 election\uc2  process before votes have even taken place,'' Mr. Obama said.\par \par \uc2 Republican and \uc2 election\uc2  officials in cities and states that Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  has singled out for potential widespread voter fraud, including Philadelphia, Pittsburgh and Ohio, said his message to supporters to become poll watchers had generated scant response.\par \par \uc2 ''There's a real disconnect between the intensity of the buzz at the national level and anything we've seen on the ground,'' said Al Schmidt, a Republican who is the vice chairman of Philadelphia's \uc2 election\uc2  board. ''We haven't received a single call from somebody outside of Philadelphia looking to be a poll watcher.''\par \par \uc2 At rallies since the summer in rural Pennsylvania, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  has spoken of the potential for ''shenanigans'' in Philadelphia, urging supporters to ''go around and watch other polling places.''\par \par \uc2 ''I hear these horror shows, and we have to make sure that this \uc2 election\uc2  is not stolen from us and is not taken away from us,'' he said last week to a nearly all-white crowd in northeast Pennsylvania. ''And everybody knows what I'm talking about.''\par \par \uc2 The type of in-person voter fraud Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  is warning about is extremely rare; one study by a Loyola Law School professor found 31 known cases out of a billion votes cast in United States elections from 2000 to 2014. Moreover, the ability to commit fraud on a scale vast enough to swing a statewide \uc2 election\uc2  would require the coordination of scores of people, a possibility widely dismissed by experts.\par \par \uc2 His call to monitor polling places betrays an ignorance of \uc2 election\uc2  laws in most states, which require poll watchers to be registered in the county or precinct where they operate.\par \par \uc2 Even though Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's website includes a form to sign up as a poll watcher and ''help me stop Crooked Hillary from rigging this \uc2 election\uc2 ,'' local officials in battleground states said they had seen no surge by \uc2 Trump\uc2  supporters seeking to be certified poll watchers.\par \par \uc2 ''The numbers this year are on par with the numbers we saw in 2012,'' said Katie Eagan, the executive director of the Ohio Republican Party, which is handling the appointment of poll watchers for the \uc2 Trump\uc2  campaign throughout the state.\par \par \uc2 True the Vote, a group dedicated to policing voter fraud that is popular on the political right, said sign-ups for an online training course it offers on how to be a poll watcher were about equal to 2012, some 200 people a day.\par \par \uc2 Last week outside Pittsburgh, speaking to a nearly all-white audience, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  told supporters that it was ''so important that you watch other communities, because we don't want this \uc2 election\uc2  stolen from us.''\par \par \uc2 But even if few are heeding Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's call to sign up as poll watchers, a big question is whether \uc2 Trump\uc2  supporters will nevertheless flood polling places on \uc2 Election\uc2  Day in Democratic strongholds.\par \par \uc2 Lisa M. Deeley, a Democrat on the Philadelphia voting board, said she feared that \uc2 Trump\uc2  supporters would gather at polling sites, where they are allowed to go within 10 feet of the entrances, to jeer voters.\par \par \uc2 ''It's one thing for any candidate to say, 'I need volunteers, come out and support my campaign,''' she said. ''But when a candidate is saying, 'I need your help because they're cheating,' it changes the game.''\par \par \uc2 In general, states permit citizen poll watchers in polling locations to check the work of \uc2 election\uc2  officials. Qualifications differ by state, but many require monitors to be registered in the county or precinct where they serve. They can be appointed by political parties, and in some cases by the candidates themselves.\par \par \uc2 In 39 states, credentialed poll watchers can challenge voters' eligibility, with the rules varying widely, said Wendy R. Weiser, the director of the Democracy Program at the Brennan Center for Justice.\par \par \uc2 Pennsylvania, which has a permissive statute, allows challenges to a voter's photo ID and residency, though the state clarified this year that challenges could not be based on ethnicity or race.\par \par \uc2 ''I think there's a real risk of improper challenges,'' Ms. Weiser said.\par \par \uc2 Philadelphia officials said Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's insinuation that widespread fraud in past elections would merit fears of a stolen \uc2 election\uc2  were groundless. The candidate appears to be echoing a charge by conservative commentators and internet rumors that the 2012 Republican nominee, \uc2 Mitt Romney\uc2 , did not receive a single vote in dozens of precincts in Philadelphia or in nearly 20 precincts in Cleveland.\par \par \uc2 Election\uc2  officials in Philadelphia said many of these precincts were as small as a single apartment building, and they were in heavily African-American parts of the city. Efforts by newspapers in Philadelphia and Cleveland to find ''missing'' Romney voters who had been erased from the vote count came up empty-handed.\par \par \uc2 Voter fraud ''does occur,'' said Mr. Schmidt, the Republican \uc2 election\uc2  commissioner in Philadelphia, who issued a report in 2012 that found a handful of irregularities.\par \par \uc2 ''But what \uc2 Trump\uc2 's talking about is widespread, coordinated efforts to alter the outcome of the \uc2 election\uc2 , and that I've just simply never seen. It would be very easy to find because it would involve a conspiracy of dozens if not hundreds of people.''\par \par \uc2 On Tuesday, state officials in Indiana said they were investigating possible fraud in thousands of voter registrations that had been altered. And \uc2 Trump\uc2  supporters in Pennsylvania say they are on guard to prevent fraud.\par \par \uc2 ''In Pennsylvania, voting irregularity isn't a myth,'' said Greg Manz, the communications director for the \uc2 Trump\uc2  campaign in the state. ''Appropriate steps should be taken to ensure all applicable rules are enforced so that the elections are free from fraud and voter irregularity this November.''\par \par \uc2 Find out what you need to know about the 2016 presidential race today, and get politics news updates via \uc2 Facebook\uc2 , \uc2 Twitter\uc2  and the First Draft newsletter.\par \par \uc2 Document NYTF000020161019ecaj0006g\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 Metropolitan Desk; SECTA\par \b \uc2 Debate Course Aims to Help Convicts Lobby for Rights\b0\par\par\uc2 By NOAH REMNICK \par \uc2 1,057 \uc2 words\par \uc2 19 October 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 19\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Like so many followers of the circus that is the presidential \uc2 election\uc2 , the men housed at the Rikers Island jail complex watched in dismay over the past several weeks as the contest between \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  and \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2  descended into an unseemly spectacle of coarse threats, personal insults and rebuffed handshakes. The rancor and puerility have surprised even the most hardened crowd.\par \par \uc2 But on Monday evening, the inmates were finally treated to some proper decorum when two of their own took to the lectern for a debate.\par \par \uc2 ''Good luck to you, kind sir,'' Juel Roundtree told his opponent, Terrell Wigfall, as they exchanged a warm greeting.\par \par \uc2 ''I look forward to hearing your points,'' Mr. Wigfall replied.\par \par \uc2 Before a rapt audience of several dozen inmates, guests and jail personnel, the two men nervously shuffled through stacks of notes as they readied for a clash of uncommon substance and civility.\par \par \uc2 This summer, amid a cacophony of political squabbles, the \uc2 New York City Department of Correction\uc2  began offering a debate program to inmates in one building at Rikers. Josh Morrison, a lawyer and former college debater who now runs an organ transplant advocacy organization, initiated the weekly course as a way to help inmates learn to lobby for their rights once they are released.\par \par \uc2 ''Incarcerated people's voices don't register in our political system,'' Mr. Morrison said. ''So we wanted to teach people in jail to advocate for themselves and to consider other points of view for the sake of conflict resolution.''\par \par \uc2 The administration of Mayor \uc2 Bill de Blasio\uc2 , a Democrat, which is under legal pressure from federal authorities to improve conditions at Rikers, has created a series of programs, like the debate team, that they hope will reduce violence and recidivism at the troubled jail. The city's 2017 fiscal budget includes approximately $22 million for a range of offerings, including creative writing and acting classes facilitated by outside groups.\par \par \uc2 In the unit where the debate program and other initiatives have been rolled out, correction officials say they have seen a 50 percent reduction in inmate fights through September as compared with the same period last year, a decline they attributed partially to the increased programming.\par \par \uc2 The Rikers Debate Project was put in place after a team from the Eastern New York Correctional Facility, a maximum-security prison in upstate New York, shocked the debate world a year ago by beating a national championship team from Harvard. The Rikers program drew around 30 inmates, who were coached for two hours every Saturday by a team of lawyers, collegiate debaters and other experts in the art of argumentation. The volunteers schooled the men in the intricacies of researching, organizing and presenting their cases no matter the topic or point of view.\par \par \uc2 After several rounds of verbal jousting, Mr. Wigfall and Mr. Roundtree emerged as the contestants for the championship debate, which posed a question integral to their lives: Should inmates be allowed to vote?\par \par \uc2 In the manner of formal debates, the participants were not told beforehand which side they would have to plead. Unlike their counterparts on the outside, though, incarcerated debaters face an additional hurdle: They cannot use the internet to prepare their cases and instead rely on books and articles, which they must get permission to read.\par \par \uc2 Both men privately agreed that prisoners should be allowed to cast ballots, but it was Mr. Roundtree who drew the unenviable task of telling those gathered that they did not deserve to vote on \uc2 Election\uc2  Day.\par \par \uc2 ''Prisoners lack good judgment and moral fiber; that's why a lot of them are here,'' Mr. Roundtree, 45, told the skeptical crowd. ''Doesn't it stand to reason that an angry man would pick an angry candidate? Somebody with their same type of temperament, maybe like a \uc2 Trump\uc2 ?''\par \par \uc2 Mr. Roundtree's jibe at Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , the Republican nominee, was greeted with some approving howls from the audience, but it was his adversary who enjoyed overwhelming support from his fellow inmates.\par \par \uc2 ''Preventing black and brown people from voting has a long history in the criminal justice system,'' Mr. Wigfall, 28, said. His speech halted and his hands trembled at first, but he quickly gained confidence as he began offering statistics about the vast overrepresentation of African-Americans behind bars. ''Everyone should have the power to have their words spoken,'' he added.\par \par \uc2 Currently, only Maine and Vermont permit prisoners to vote. The other states have prohibitions that range from lifetime bans after felony convictions to ones that are erased when a sentence, probation or parole is completed. In New York, felons can vote when they are on probation or after they have completed parole, according to the \uc2 New York Civil Liberties Union\uc2 . Disenfranchisement affects roughly six million United States citizens and disproportionately hits African-Americans.\par \par \uc2 Sitting alongside the men facing off were two expert debaters assigned to take part in the discussion. Alex Taubes, a lawyer, assisted Mr. Wigfall on the pro-voting side; and Rocky Lotito, a sales executive and the former coach of Columbia's debate team, collaborated with Mr. Roundtree.\par \par \uc2 The Rikers Debate Project has drafted a prisoner voting rights bill that those involved are hoping will find interest in the New York State Assembly.\par \par \uc2 After a final tally from the panel of experts and Rikers staff members, Mr. Wigfall was deemed the victor, drawing a prolonged and spirited ovation from the audience.\par \par \uc2 Even after the inmates returned to their cells, discussion continued among staff members. Monica Windley, the warden, said she was impressed with Mr. Roundtree's rhetorical prowess, but maintained her support for inmates' right to vote.\par \par \uc2 Frankie Mitchell, a senior coordinator of adult programming at Rikers, said that while he was skeptical about inmate voting, he was swayed by the arguments in favor of it. ''What ultimately put me over the top was one idea,'' he explained. ''You're never as bad as your worst day.''\par \par \uc2 Still, there was clear consensus among the judges on one issue.\par \par \uc2 ''I don't want to watch another presidential debate,'' Ms. Windley said. ''I prefer these guys.''\par \par \uc2 From left, Alex Taubes, Terrell Wigfall, Juel Roundtree and Rocky Lotito at a debate at the Rikers Island jail complex on Monday.

\par\par \uc2 National Desk; SECTA\par \b \uc2 Teaching Seventh Graders in a Shocking \uc2 Election\uc2  Season\b0\par\par\uc2 By JULIE BOSMAN \par \uc2 1,219 \uc2 words\par \uc2 19 October 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 10\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 EAU CLAIRE, Wis. -- Maybe it's the talk of fat shaming, or adultery, or sexual assault, or bans on Muslims and walls to keep out Mexicans. But Brent Wathke is having a rough time teaching this presidential campaign to his seventh graders.\par \par \uc2 He is not planning to show his students the third presidential debate on Wednesday; he feels the debates have long ago crossed over into inappropriate. Television ads, particularly the ones from \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's campaign that heavily quote \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , are filled with misogynistic comments. Even political cartoons, which Mr. Wathke would have liked to use to teach his students about the delicate art of satire, are too risqu\u233\'00\'E9.\par \par \uc2 ''It is a total mess,'' said Mr. Wathke, 33, sitting in his classroom at DeLong Middle School one morning last week, near a dry-erase board where he had scrawled ''25 Days to \uc2 Election\uc2 '' in a red marker. ''Honestly, I just can't wait until it's over.''\par \par \uc2 Mr. Wathke is one of countless teachers across the country who have anguished over the dark and sometimes shocking tone of the presidential campaign. Like many, he has searched for ways to talk about it in class. Some teachers are planning mock debates before the \uc2 election\uc2 ; others, like Mr. Wathke, fear that the format could invite students to spout insulting rhetoric.\par \par \uc2 His students, most of whom are 12 years old, have been buzzing with talk of the campaign all year. The first group of students poured into the classroom just before 7:30 a.m., clutching notebooks and binders, and sat in desks arranged in circles.\par \par \uc2 ''I believe if \uc2 Trump\uc2  is elected, it's going to be like 'The Hunger Games,' '' said Payton Foy, prompting nervous giggles around the room. ''I'm not trying to be mean to \uc2 Trump\uc2 . I just really believe that.''\par \par \uc2 Another student piped up, saying she had watched the second presidential debate the night before. ''And?'' Mr. Wathke asked.\par \par \uc2 ''It was bad,'' she said.\par \par \uc2 He grimaced. ''I don't want to shield you guys from that, but there are some things in there that just aren't appropriate for school,'' he said. ''So we're going to stick to the issues today.''\par \par \uc2 Mr. Wathke has spent down time on evenings and weekends worrying about the effect of the campaign on his seventh graders. In Chicago on a recent weekend to run his 13th marathon (he is also one of the school's cross-country coaches), he read the news that an ''Access Hollywood'' microphone had captured Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  on a bus bragging about groping women. There was not time for Mr. Wathke to consider the political implications; his mind raced ahead to the coming Monday morning.\par \par \uc2 ''All I'm thinking is, 'How am I going to approach this?' '' he said.\par \par \uc2 His students said they have also wondered what they were allowed to say about the campaign in class. ''We self-censor a lot,'' said Connor Felton, 12. ''I think if you repeat some stuff that \uc2 Trump\uc2  says, you could get sent down to the principal's office. Maybe even expelled.''\par \par \uc2 Here in Eau Claire, a retail and manufacturing hub of 68,000 people in this crucial swing state, children and teenagers are most likely exposed to more political messages than most of their peers in other states.\par \par \uc2 Campaign ads and yard signs are everywhere; both Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  and Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  have held rallies in town this year. Mr. Wathke said he gets nervous when he hears that his students are planning to attend rallies. At Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's rallies, the candidate has used foul language and mimicked a reporter with a physical disability. His supporters often wear T-shirts with crude sexual slogans referring to Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 In Mr. Wathke's own classroom, he has aimed for civility. A native of Eau Claire with a polite manner, he was once a student at DeLong, where he now teaches in the same classroom where he learned social studies. Now, those walls are plastered with campaign signs, many years or decades old: Bush/Quayle '92, Dole for President, Irish Americans for Kerry/Edwards.\par \par \uc2 This semester, Mr. Wathke and his five social studies classes have been talking about politics -- delicately -- since August. He is teaching his seventh graders about the three branches of government, how democracies work and the differences between Republicans and Democrats.\par \par \uc2 Since he feels that free-form debate is risky, he prepared his class to discuss the campaign using ''Socratic circles,'' separating students into small groups. The students were armed with work sheets, filled out before class, answering questions he had posed. What are the most important issues facing the country? Where do the candidates stand? Which candidate would be a better president?\par \par \uc2 At the beginning of one discussion, he laid out a warning. ''We're going to be talking about some topics today that can get a little tricky today and a little heated,'' he said. ''But we want to make sure we're being respectful of one another and we're not hurting feelings. Remember when we watched some of that debate? And there was one thing that was the most annoying thing? The interruptions. We don't want interruptions today.''\par \par \uc2 At the end of one discussion, Mr. Wathke looked relieved. ''I want to say that you did pretty darn good,'' he said. ''You avoided the memes you see on social media. You stuck to the issues.''\par \par \uc2 His approach: Tread lightly and let the students move their own discussion. If the conversation in class turns inappropriate, step in.\par \par \uc2 ''The campaign is ruining a lot of classes,'' Mr. Wathke said. ''You have kids saying, 'We need to have a wall to keep Mexicans out.' Well, what do you do if you have kids who are Mexican in the class?''\par \par \uc2 That kind of conversation in the campaign arouses anger in some of his students. ''Racial profiling is going way back in time,'' said Donna Xiong, 12. ''I don't think it's O.K. at all. If I got kicked out of a store for being Asian or for my skin tone, that's not right.''\par \par \uc2 Gabriel Morken, 12, said he believed the \uc2 Black Lives Matter movement\uc2  was one of the most important issues. ''\uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  thinks it's really bad,'' he said. ''Hillary wants everybody to be equal and stuff.''\par \par \uc2 DeLong has a history of holding mock elections, and for as long as anybody there can remember, maybe 20 years or more, the students have chosen the candidate who later won the presidential \uc2 election\uc2 . This year, the mock \uc2 election\uc2  will be on Nov. 8.\par \par \uc2 After a group of his students filed out, Mr. Wathke said he never knows quite how much campaign news they have absorbed on \uc2 YouTube\uc2  and Snapchat, where they spend so much time. He assumes they see everything.\par \par \uc2 A few weeks back, he decided to show them a Romney-Obama debate from 2012, for a contrast. ''I thought I'd show them what a typical debate would be like,'' he said. ''The first response was, 'That's kind of boring.'

\par\par \uc2 National Desk; SECTA\par \b \uc2 Sanders Backers Rue an Opportunity Lost\b0\par\par\uc2 By MATT FLEGENHEIMER and YAMICHE ALCINDOR \par \uc2 1,272 \uc2 words\par \uc2 19 October 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 15\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Even to skeptics, the presidential campaign of Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont has often appeared less quixotic with the benefit of hindsight.\par \par \uc2 If Mr. Sanders had only edged \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  in Iowa -- and not the other way around -- before winning a blowout in New Hampshire, perhaps things would have been different.\par \par \uc2 If he had only attacked Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's use of a private email server as secretary of state, instead of offering her a reprieve, some supporters lamented, perhaps things would have been different.\par \par \uc2 And now, as Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  contends with daily disclosures from the hacked messages of top campaign aides -- missives that have reinforced the central progressive criticisms of her bid, including her coziness with Wall Street -- some of Mr. Sanders's admirers have been compelled to consider again what might have been.\par \par \uc2 With a couple of breaks and more fortunate timing, many of them believe, the rumpled socialist really, truly could have been president.\par \par \uc2 ''I think they should have put the damn emails out before the primaries were over,'' said RoseAnn DeMoro, the executive director of \uc2 National Nurses United\uc2 , a union that campaigned heavily for Mr. Sanders. ''Bernie could have won the \uc2 election\uc2 , and that's the most irritating and painful thing. It would have made a world of difference.\par \par \uc2 ''Now we are going to have a dynamic status quo,'' Ms. DeMoro predicted. ''It's going to look like change. But it's not change.''\par \par \uc2 Not all Sanders supporters believe an earlier release would have altered the \uc2 election\uc2 . The emails -- disseminated by \uc2 WikiLeaks\uc2  from the account of \uc2 John D. Podesta\uc2 , Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's campaign chairman, who has attributed the hack to Russian intelligence officials -- have created a relatively modest headache for Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  as she nears \uc2 Election\uc2  Day, providing occasional fodder for \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2  as Democrats condemn the apparent foreign interference in an American \uc2 election\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 But the content of the messages, while a measure short of astonishing so far, almost certainly could have upended a primary campaign premised largely on Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's place in an increasingly progressive and populist Democratic Party.\par \par \uc2 In excerpts from paid speeches to financial institutions and corporate audiences, Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  embraced unfettered international trade and offered praise for a budget-balancing plan that would have required cuts to Social Security. She spoke of the need for ''a public and a private position'' on politically sensitive issues. And she allowed that her family's growing wealth had left her ''kind of far removed'' from the experience of the middle class.\par \par \uc2 ''I feel like I'm channeling Captain Renault from 'Casablanca,''' said Jonathan Tasini, a former union leader who challenged Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  in her Senate primary in New York in 2006. ''I'm shocked -- shocked! -- that \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  has a close relationship with Wall Street.''\par \par \uc2 It is a familiar, if still painful, sensation for Sanders backers, even as most of his voters drift toward Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , some more haltingly than others.\par \par \uc2 For at least a handful, the emails have especially rankled given the seeming free fall of Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , which has bolstered their view that Mr. Sanders's proudly left-wing politics would not have precluded victory in the general \uc2 election\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 On the heels of leaked emails over the summer from the \uc2 Democratic National Committee\uc2 , which suggested favoritism toward Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  among party leaders, and persistent complaints that Mr. Sanders's bid was not taken seriously enough from the start, Sanders allies say the latest revelations have heightened tensions that are likely to persist if Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  is elected.\par \par \uc2 ''There is still this real disconnect between her and working people. That's very difficult to see,'' Winnie Wong, a founder of People for Bernie, a group of Sanders supporters, said of Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 . ''The people really have to get together and make sure some of these agenda items on the platform become a reality.''\par \par \uc2 Ms. DeMoro, of the nurses' union, expressed outrage over an email sent to Mr. Podesta by Randi Weingarten, the president of the American Federation of Teachers, who vowed to combat the nurses' ''high and mighty sanctimonious conduct.'' (Mr. Podesta replied, ''Thanks.'')\par \par \uc2 ''We are going to have to fight and organize like we would against a Republican, if the emails ring true,'' Ms. DeMoro said.\par \par \uc2 And Nina Turner, a former state senator from Ohio who campaigned for Mr. Sanders -- and who has not endorsed Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  -- said she was especially troubled by an email that she said seemed filled with vindictiveness. In it, two longtime \uc2 Clinton\uc2  supporters wrote to Representative Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii, who resigned her position at the \uc2 Democratic National Committee\uc2  to endorse Mr. Sanders, and told Ms. Gabbard that they would no longer raise money for her.\par \par \uc2 ''It tells me they are going to be gunning if I dare to run for anything else,'' Ms. Turner said. ''Here you have a very good public servant in Hawaii that went with her heart, and what she gets are threats by the moneyed machine.''\par \par \uc2 Robert B. Reich, a secretary of labor under President \uc2 Bill \uc2 Clinton\uc2  who supported Mr. Sanders in the primary, said that perhaps the most worrisome message in the Podesta files came in October 2008 from Michael B. Froman, a former \uc2 Citigroup\uc2  executive who now serves as the United States trade representative.\par \par \uc2 Under the subject line ''Lists,'' Mr. Froman offered a collection of prospective cabinet members, weeks before President Obama's \uc2 election\uc2 . Many on the list were later named to the very posts he suggested.\par \par \uc2 If that history is any guide, Mr. Reich said, ''the concern is that personnel decisions are already being made, and that Wall Street has a seat at the table.''\par \par \uc2 On the campaign trail, Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  has insisted that she is fully committed to progressive policies, frequently trumpeting a college tuition plan that absorbed elements of Mr. Sanders's, among other agenda items.\par \par \uc2 And Mr. Sanders himself has suppressed any latent frustrations, continuing to campaign aggressively for Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  and declining to dwell on the emails.\par \par \uc2 ''The job of the progressive movement now is to look forward, not backward,'' he said in a statement after the speech excerpts were revealed. ''No matter what Secretary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  may have said years ago behind closed doors, what's important today is that millions of people stand up and demand that the Democratic Party implement the most progressive platform in the history of our country.''\par \par \uc2 Some supporters, too, have cast doubt on whether the emails would have affected Mr. Sanders's chances had they surfaced before the primaries.\par \par \uc2 Dan Cantor\uc2 , the national director of the Working Families Party, which supported Mr. Sanders and has since endorsed Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , said the emails would have been unlikely to dent Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's support among the black voters who helped lift her to the Democratic nomination.\par \par \uc2 ''Hillary's firewall was based above all on strong support from African-American leaders and voters, and they weren't in the dark about her relationships on Wall Street,'' Mr. Cantor said. ''Bernie did something incredible that will have long-lasting effects, but \uc2 Clinton\uc2  won fair and square.''\par \par \uc2 Find out what you need to know about the 2016 presidential race today, and get politics news updates via \uc2 Facebook\uc2 , \uc2 Twitter\uc2  and the First Draft newsletter.\par \par \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  boarding a plane Tuesday in White Plains.

\par\par \uc2 National Desk; SECTA\par \b \uc2 Stop 'Whining' and Trying to Discredit the \uc2 Election\uc2 , Obama Tells \uc2 Trump\b0\par\par\uc2 By MARK LANDLER and ASHLEY PARKER \par \uc2 1,261 \uc2 words\par \uc2 19 October 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 12\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 WASHINGTON -- President Obama ridiculed \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2  on Tuesday for saying that the presidential \uc2 election\uc2  was rigged against him, telling Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , the Republican nominee, to ''stop whining and go try to make his case'' to win more votes than \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 At a news conference in the White House Rose Garden, Mr. Obama said, ''I have never seen in my lifetime, or in modern political history, any presidential candidate trying to discredit the elections and the \uc2 election\uc2  process before votes have even taken place.''\par \par \uc2 By turns mocking and grave, Mr. Obama said the claims demonstrated that Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  lacked the leadership or toughness to be president. But he warned that the charges, which Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  repeated to cheers at a rally in Colorado later in the day, would undermine the nation's purest expression of democracy, a popular vote respected by the vanquished as well as the victors.\par \par \uc2 His sharp words reflected rising concerns among Democratic and Republican leaders that Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's drumbeat of accusations was resonating with his supporters. Many worry that if Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  wins and Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  refuses to accept the result, his stand will undermine her authority going into office and sow doubts about the legitimacy of the process.\par \par \uc2 On Tuesday, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  did not heed Mr. Obama's warning. While he did not address the president directly, he repeated his claims of an \uc2 election\uc2  stolen through voter fraud -- singling out, with no evidence, African-American communities as the likely culprits of the fraud.\par \par \uc2 ''Voter fraud is all too common, and then they criticize us for saying that,'' he said in Colorado Springs. ''But take a look at Philadelphia, what's been going on, take a look at Chicago, take a look at St. Louis. Take a look at some of these cities, where you see things happening that are horrendous.''\par \par \uc2 ''And if you talk about it, they say bad things about you, they call you a racist,'' Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  added.\par \par \uc2 Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  was off the campaign trail on Tuesday, preparing for her final debate with Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  on Wednesday, so it fell to Mr. Obama to rebut Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's assertions. The president did so with obvious relish.\par \par \uc2 There is no evidence, he said, that a presidential \uc2 election\uc2  has ever been rigged. He said there was little indication that it could be, given that elections are run by state and local authorities, with people from both parties supervising polling sites and ballot counting.\par \par \uc2 ''The notion that somehow if Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  loses Florida, it is because of those people that you have to watch out for,'' he said, his voice thick with sarcasm. ''That is both irresponsible and, by the way, doesn't really show the kind of leadership and toughness that you want out of a president.''\par \par \uc2 ''If you start whining before the game's even over,'' Mr. Obama continued, ''if whenever things are going badly for you and you lose, you start blaming somebody else, then you don't have what it takes to be in this job, because there are times when things don't go our way -- or my way.''\par \par \uc2 Mr. Obama has been a happy warrior for Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  on the stump, not hesitating to tar Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  for his judgment, veracity and fitness for office. At first, though, he said he was reluctant to use the setting of the Rose Garden -- where he stood next to Prime Minister \uc2 Matteo Renzi\uc2  of Italy -- to deliver another broadside against Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Asked about Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's statement that, if elected, he would meet with President \uc2 Vladimir V. Putin\uc2  of Russia before taking office, Mr. Obama replied, ''I'm going to be a little more subdued in my discussions of the Republican nominee in this context than I might be on the campaign trail.''\par \par \uc2 ''Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  rarely surprises me anymore,'' the president said in a measured tone. He said he was more surprised that other Republican leaders, who had stridently opposed his efforts to reach out to Russia early in his presidency, would now endorse a candidate who he said was unprecedented in his ''flattery of Mr. Putin.''\par \par \uc2 But when the subject returned to the Republican nominee -- and the issue of voter fraud -- Mr. Obama cast off his restraint.\par \par \uc2 ''I'd invite Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  to stop whining and go try to make his case to get votes,'' he said. If Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  won, the president added, Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  would deliver a concession speech and he would escort Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  to the Capitol for the time-honored ritual of a peaceful transfer of power.\par \par \uc2 ''That's what Americans do,'' he said. ''That's why America is already great. One way of weakening America, making it less great, is if you start betraying those basic American traditions that have been bipartisan, and have helped hold together this democracy now for well over two centuries.''\par \par \uc2 Many Republicans have responded with a chorus of criticism, including the House speaker, Representative Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin, the titular head of the party. On Monday night, Senator \uc2 Marco Rubio\uc2  of Florida, a primary challenger of Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's, joined in during a debate in Orlando with his Democratic senatorial challenger, Representative Patrick Murphy.\par \par \uc2 ''This \uc2 election\uc2  is not being rigged,'' Mr. Rubio said, adding that Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  ''should stop saying that.''\par \par \uc2 ''We have 67 counties in this state, each of which conduct their own elections,'' Mr. Rubio said. ''I promise you there is not a 67-county conspiracy to rig this \uc2 election\uc2 .''\par \par \uc2 The latest tempest overshadowed Mr. Obama's meeting with Mr. Renzi, a charismatic young Italian leader whom the president welcomed with a flourish. On Tuesday night, he and Mrs. Obama were to honor Mr. Renzi and his wife, Agnese Landini, at the final state dinner of the Obama administration, with a menu by the celebrity chef Mario Batali and entertainment by the pop star Gwen Stefani.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Renzi was good-natured about the distractions of his host and the press corps. When an Italian journalist asked him about a coming referendum at home, he replied: ''I have a feeling, and I think rightly so, our American friends are a little bit more interested in Nov. 8 than in the Italian vote on constitutional reform. And so are we, might I add.''\par \par \uc2 Mr. Obama touched on another political issue -- this one with implications for Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's campaign. He denied reports that the State Department and the F.B.I. had discussed a quid pro quo to settle a dispute over how one of Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's emails should be classified. The exchange between the F.B.I. official and a senior State Department official, Patrick F. Kennedy, was part of a routine give-and-take between agencies, he said.\par \par \uc2 ''Based on what we have seen, heard, learned,'' Mr. Obama said, ''some of the more sensational implications or appearances, as you stated them, aren't based on actual events and based on what actually happened.''\par \par \uc2 Find out what you need to know about the 2016 presidential race today, and get politics news updates via \uc2 Facebook\uc2 , \uc2 Twitter\uc2  and the First Draft newsletter.\par \par \uc2 President Obama, at a news conference with Prime Minister Matteo Renzi of Italy, said there was no evidence a presidential \uc2 election\uc2  had ever been rigged.

\par\par \uc2 National Desk; SECTA\par \b \uc2 Anchor's Role in Final Presidential Debate Is a Bright Spot in a Dark Year for Fox\b0\par\par\uc2 By MICHAEL M. GRYNBAUM \par \uc2 1,141 \uc2 words\par \uc2 19 October 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 11\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 LAS VEGAS -- A flashy broadcast studio is making its debut at Fox News on \uc2 Election\uc2  Night, with LED floors and a sweeping view of Manhattan through bulletproof glass.\par \par \uc2 Rupert Murdoch\uc2 , in conversations with staff members, has pledged more reporters, new bureaus -- even higher-end commercials. (Mr. Murdoch, it seems, is unimpressed with some of the sleepier ads in prime time.)\par \par \uc2 And on Wednesday here in Las Vegas, Fox News will celebrate a milestone for a channel that has long scrabbled for journalistic legitimacy: Its Sunday anchor, Chris Wallace, is set to moderate the final presidential debate, the first Fox journalist to take charge of a general \uc2 election\uc2  face-off.\par \par \uc2 It would be the most consequential night of Fox News's year -- if the network had not just endured the most traumatic period in its two-decade history.\par \par \uc2 Months after the ouster of Roger Ailes, Fox's longtime chairman, the network is seeking to move forward, even as sadness and anger linger over the revelations from multiple women who have come forward to accuse Mr. Ailes of sexual harassment. Unease remains: Sean Hannity and Megyn Kelly recently feuded on \uc2 Twitter\uc2 , the sort of friendly fire once considered a network taboo. Stars like Ms. Kelly have mused about leaving.\par \par \uc2 So for the team of Fox anchors and producers here this week, Mr. Wallace's star turn is a welcome source of pride. And, maybe, some relief.\par \par \uc2 ''It was something that was really positive in, you know, not the best of years,'' said Bret Baier, Fox's chief political anchor, as he relaxed in his hotel room after an afternoon taping.\par \par \uc2 Fox News is relentlessly promoting Wednesday's debate, frequently broadcasting a photograph of a smiling Mr. Wallace in the corner of the screen. (Other networks use images of \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  and \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2 .) A full slate of Fox talent was flown out for the week, and anchors will broadcast from an outdoor terrace at the MGM Grand.\par \par \uc2 The selection of Mr. Wallace, a veteran broadcaster with a reputation for tough, mischief-making questions, was particularly bolstering for Fox's news division, which has viewed itself as an unfairly maligned alternative to the network's stable of conservative commentators like Mr. Hannity and Bill O'Reilly. The commentators provide opinion, the in-house mantra goes, while the news team deals in facts.\par \par \uc2 ''People have always glommed onto O'Reilly and Hannity and the opinion part of the news channel,'' said Jay Wallace, Fox's executive vice president, who oversees news coverage. ''But I think, with Chris Wallace at the debate, it's really showing that the hard work we've put into the news product over the years, when no one was paying attention to us, has really paid off.''\par \par \uc2 Employees intent on turning the page from a scandal that made global headlines have also welcomed Mr. Murdoch's presence as the new executive chairman. Several anchors, including Mr. Baier, said that Mr. Murdoch had described to them plans for an aggressive expansion of the channel's news operation, including the opening of the new Manhattan studio.\par \par \uc2 ''He's one of us -- he's a news guy,'' said Brit Hume, the network's longtime political analyst, who said he had also spoken with Mr. Murdoch. ''It's a tremendous sense of encouragement.''\par \par \uc2 It could also be a business decision. Ratings at \uc2 CNN\uc2  spiked this year, and the network recently closed in on Fox News in the advertising demographic of viewers ages 25 to 54. MSNBC, though still trailing, has seen an upturn.\par \par \uc2 Fox News is still ranked first this year for its biggest audience since it started broadcasting in 1996, back when the notion of a Fox-affiliated debate moderator would have been dismissed as ridiculous.\par \par \uc2 Still, the network must also confront a changing political reality. Upstart outlets like Breitbart News have lured sections of its traditional Republican audience, particularly supporters of Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , who has openly warred with Ms. Kelly and occasionally criticized Fox's news coverage, even as Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  routinely appears with Mr. O'Reilly and Mr. Hannity.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Hannity's full-throated embrace of Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  has been at the root of some internal dust-ups, including the tiff with Ms. Kelly. (The anchors later posted a photograph of themselves smiling together, with the caption, ''It's complicated.'') Asked about balancing news coverage with Mr. Hannity's advocacy, Jay Wallace offered a diplomatic reply: ''It is nuanced.''\par \par \uc2 ''There is competition between the shows,'' he added. ''If all the shows were the same, why would anyone tune in?''\par \par \uc2 Mr. Hannity, interviewed in a Fox dressing room here Monday evening, was asked if he had faced internal pushback for promoting the \uc2 Trump\uc2  campaign.\par \par \uc2 ''My bosses have only given me nothing but support and appreciation for the high ratings I get,'' Mr. Hannity replied, as a makeup artist fussed with his hair. ''As far as my colleagues? I don't mean this to be disrespectful, but I don't care what they think. They've got their role, and I've got mine.''\par \par \uc2 Mr. Hannity was in a feisty mood, referring to this bearded reporter as a ''hippie'' and suggesting that he would not get a fair shake from The \uc2 New York Times\uc2 . He said that he had great admiration for Fox's reporters, even if opinion shows like his own helped set his network apart.\par \par \uc2 ''Why are we successful? What's the reason? Part of the reason is people like me,'' Mr. Hannity said. ''I would argue that you take away what I do, and what Bill O'Reilly does and what others do, you lose the flavor that makes us different, and then we're just basically the same as everybody else.''\par \par \uc2 Has Mr. Hannity given Chris Wallace tips for handling Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 ? ''I don't give Chris Wallace tips on how to do his job,'' he said.\par \par \uc2 What about giving Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  tips on handling Mr. Wallace? ''Nope,'' Mr. Hannity replied.\par \par \uc2 Soon, Mr. Hannity had taken his perch for that evening's broadcast, a light Las Vegas wind rustling his suit. He spotted this reporter and gave a shout.\par \par \uc2 ''This is the spice!'' he said, laughing, referring to his show. ''We're getting back to the spicy part of the network, the one that pays the bills.''\par \par \uc2 He added, ''No one wants to talk about that part.''\par \par \uc2 Chris Wallace, Megyn Kelly and Bret Baier in Cleveland. Mr. Wallace will be the moderator at the last presidential debate.

\par\par \uc2 OP-ED COLUMNIST\par \uc2 Editorial Desk; SECTA\par \b \uc2 WikiHillary for President\b0\par\par\uc2 By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN \par \uc2 922 \uc2 words\par \uc2 19 October 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 23\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Thank God for \uc2 WikiLeaks\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 I confess, I was starting to wonder about what the real \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  -- the one you never get to see behind closed doors -- really stood for. But now that, thanks to \uc2 WikiLeaks\uc2 , I've had a chance to peruse her speeches to \uc2 Goldman Sachs\uc2  and other banks, I am more convinced than ever she can be the president America needs today.\par \par \uc2 Seriously, those speeches are great! They show someone with a vision, a pragmatic approach to getting things done and a healthy instinct for balancing the need to strengthen our social safety nets with unleashing America's business class to create the growth required to sustain social programs.\par \par \uc2 So thank you, \uc2 Vladimir Putin\uc2 , for revealing how Hillary really hopes to govern. I just wish more of that Hillary were campaigning right now and building a mandate for what she really believes.\par \par \uc2 WikiHillary? I'm with her.\par \par \uc2 Why? Let's start with what \uc2 WikiLeaks\uc2  says she said at Brazil's Banco Ita\u250\'00\'FA event in May 2013: ''I think we have to have a concerted plan to increase trade ... and we have to resist protectionism, other kinds of barriers to market access and to trade.''\par \par \uc2 She also said, ''My dream is a hemispheric common market, with open trade and open borders, some time in the future with energy that is as green and sustainable as we can get it, powering growth and opportunity for every person in the hemisphere.''\par \par \uc2 That's music to my ears. A hemisphere where nations are trading with one another, and where more people can collaborate and interact for work, study, tourism and commerce, is a region that is likely to be growing more prosperous with fewer conflicts, especially if more of that growth is based on clean energy.\par \par \uc2 Compare our hemisphere, or the \uc2 European Union\uc2 , or the Asian trading nations with, say, the Middle East -- where the flow of trade, tourism, knowledge and labor among nations has long been restricted -- and the case for Hillary's vision becomes obvious.\par \par \uc2 The way Bernie Sanders and \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  have made trade and globalization dirty words is ridiculous. Globalization and trade have helped to bring more people out of poverty in the last 50 years than at any other time in history.\par \par \uc2 Do we need to make adjustments so the minority of the U.S. population that is hurt by freer trade and movements of labor is compensated and better protected? You bet we do. That's called fixing a problem -- not throwing out a whole system that we know from a long historical record contributes on balance to economic growth, competitiveness and more open societies.\par \par \uc2 In a speech to a \uc2 Morgan Stanley\uc2  group on April 18, 2013, WikiHillary praised the Simpson-Bowles deficit reduction plan, which included reforming the tax code to increase investment and entrepreneurship and raising certain taxes and trimming some spending and entitlements to make them more sustainable.\par \par \uc2 The ultimate shape of that grand bargain could take many forms, she said, but Hillary stressed behind closed doors: ''Simpson-Bowles ... put forth the right framework. Namely, we have to restrain spending, we have to have adequate revenues and we have to incentivize growth. It's a three-part formula.''\par \par \uc2 She is right. We'll never get out of this economic rut, and protect future generations, unless the business and social sectors, Democrats and Republicans, all give and get something -- and that's exactly where WikiHillary was coming from.\par \par \uc2 In an October 2013 speech for \uc2 Goldman Sachs\uc2 , \uc2 Clinton\uc2  seemed to suggest the need to review the regulations imposed on banks by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, which was passed in 2010. Her idea was not to get rid of all of the rules but rather to make sure they were not imposing needless burdens that limited lending to small businesses and start-ups.\par \par \uc2 As \uc2 Clinton\uc2  put it, ''More thought has to be given to the process and transactions and regulations so that we don't kill or maim what works, but we concentrate on the most effective way of moving forward with the brainpower and the financial power that exists here.'' Again, exactly right.\par \par \uc2 You can also find WikiHillary, or her aides, musing about a ''carbon tax'' and whether or not to come out in favor of it, as Sanders did. She chose not to now, probably to avoid being saddled by Republicans with calling for a new tax in the general \uc2 election\uc2  campaign, but I am confident she'd make pricing carbon part of her climate policy.\par \par \uc2 When I read WikiHillary, I hear a smart, pragmatic, center-left politician who will be inclined to work with both the business community and Republicans to keep America tilted toward trade expansion, entrepreneurship and global integration, while redoubling efforts to cushion workers from the downsides of these policies.\par \par \uc2 I'm just sorry that campaign Hillary felt she could not speak like WikiHillary to build a proper mandate for President Hillary. She would have gained respect for daring to speak the truth to her own constituency -- and demonstrating leadership -- not lost votes.\par \par \uc2 Nonetheless, thanks to \uc2 WikiLeaks\uc2 , I am reassured that she has the right balance of instincts on the issues I care about most. So, again, thank you, Putin, for exposing that Hillary. She could make a pretty good president for these times.\par \par \uc2 Follow The \uc2 New York Times\uc2  Opinion section on \uc2 Facebook\uc2  and \uc2 Twitter\uc2  (@NYTopinion), and sign up for the Opinion Today newsletter.\par \par \uc2 Document NYTF000020161019ecaj0004m\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 National Desk; SECTA\par \b \uc2 Ex-General Offers an Angry Voice of Authority\b0\par\par\uc2 By MATTHEW ROSENBERG \par \uc2 1,333 \uc2 words\par \uc2 19 October 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 1\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 WASHINGTON -- Before leading chants of ''Lock her up!'' and endorsing the ''extreme vetting'' of Muslim immigrants, Lt. Gen. Michael T. Flynn, a retired career intelligence officer and registered Democrat who is advising \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , was already denouncing what he saw as the Obama administration's failure to tackle Islamist militancy and the many faults of \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 But if few people were listening before this year's presidential campaign, many are now.\par \par \uc2 General Flynn, 57, took a star turn at the Republican convention in July, and no matter who wins in November, he appears likely to emerge from the campaign as the angry voice of what could best be described as the alternative right of the American national security establishment.\par \par \uc2 For now, though, his focus is on getting Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  elected. General Flynn talks to his candidate multiple times a week, has sat in on the two intelligence briefings that the Republican nominee has received, and is part of the team that is helping to prepare Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , as much as it can, for the third and final presidential debate on Wednesday, when national security is supposed to be one of the night's six topics.\par \par \uc2 In an \uc2 election\uc2  year filled with strange and jarring turns, General Flynn's entry into politics may be one of the most unusual. He has gone from being one of the most respected military officers of his generation to one of its most openly partisan, loudly inveighing against what he sees as a corrupt Washington elite that has left the United States weak and vulnerable.\par \par \uc2 No one else on Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's national security team comes with the pedigree of General Flynn, who was director of the Defense Intelligence Agency until 2014, and no one has brought the same level of vitriol.\par \par \uc2 ''What's happening with the U.S.? Where's the leadership? That's what I want to see change,'' he said in an interview. ''Am I angry or frustrated? Yeah. Who wouldn't be?''\par \par \uc2 He is angry about the ''political correctness'' that makes President Obama and Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  shy from even uttering the phrase ''radical Islamic terrorism'' -- a phrase the general makes a point of using, often -- never mind tackling the very real threat he believes it poses. He is angry about what he sees as the lack of accountability represented by Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  and her emails. He is angry that the United States, under both Republicans and Democrats, keeps blundering into wars that seem only to make enemies of what should be natural allies, like Russia, in the fight against Islamist militancy.\par \par \uc2 It has left friends and critics alike wondering where General Flynn's ideas end and Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's begin.\par \par \uc2 ''I wasn't surprised to hear him being outspoken when he retired,'' David Hall, a retired Navy Reserve officer and federal prosecutor, said of General Flynn, with whom he worked in the Pentagon. ''He was always willing to speak up when he was frustrated or the process wasn't going well.''\par \par \uc2 ''But going overtly political really surprised me,'' Mr. Hall said. ''I'd never heard him make any political remarks, or even a remark that I could view as a disguised political remark.''\par \par \uc2 General Flynn said he had become involved in the \uc2 Trump\uc2  campaign out of the same patriotic duty that led him to a 33-year career in the military. But for all the harsh talk, he can strike surprisingly bipartisan notes. He said, for example, that he would have advised Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  had she reached out to him.\par \par \uc2 ''Whatever the outcome of this \uc2 election\uc2 , I would like to think that people would still say, 'Look, this guy has some expertise,''' he said.\par \par \uc2 Unless Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  wins, that is unlikely to happen. General Flynn these days is as much of an outcast as one can be in the Washington national security establishment, much of which has lined up behind Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 That seems just fine with General Flynn. He has little patience for the Republican neoconservatives who led the United States into Iraq during the George W. Bush administration -- ''they've gotten us into mess after mess for the wrong reasons'' -- and he sees the Democratic national security establishment as no better.\par \par \uc2 ''\uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  pushed to get us into Libya. Is she a neocon on the Democratic side?'' he said. ''We're in too many conflicts that just seem to be perpetual.''\par \par \uc2 He is also not uncritical of the Republican nominee. He called the recording of Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  talking about grabbing and kissing women ''disgusting,'' and he said he and others had advised Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  to take a tougher line with Russia before the previous debates, especially when it came to the hacking of the \uc2 Democratic National Committee\uc2  and \uc2 Clinton\uc2  campaign staff members.\par \par \uc2 The United States should be cultivating Russia as an ally to fight Islamist militancy, he said, but ''do I want Russia to influence our \uc2 election\uc2 ? Absolutely not.'' He added, ''They need to be told in no uncertain terms to knock it off.''\par \par \uc2 But General Flynn is dismissive of former colleagues in the military who have privately and publicly urged him to dial back his support for Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 ''They're saying, 'You're using your title in politics.' So? You're not using your titles, admirals and generals, to get on corporate boards?'' General Flynn said.\par \par \uc2 ''I care deeply about this country,'' he continued. ''I actually found it very disrespectful that those guys would come out and counsel me publicly.''\par \par \uc2 In any case, General Flynn never saw himself as part of their club. He did not come to the military with the West Point pedigree of many of his peers -- he graduated from the Army's Reserve Officers Training Corps program at the \uc2 University of Rhode Island\uc2  -- and his roots were scrappier than those of most generals, he said, describing his family as ''definitely lower middle class.''\par \par \uc2 During his time in the Army, General Flynn earned a reputation for being outspoken and unconventional and, in the years after the Sept. 11 attacks, for being unusually good at taking apart terrorist networks. He helped reshape the Joint Special Operations Command at the height of the war in Iraq, ran military intelligence in Afghanistan during the Obama administration's troop surge and was named director of the Defense Intelligence Agency by Mr. Obama in 2012.\par \par \uc2 But his term at the agency was cut short after two years. His detractors say that he lacked the experience to manage an operation with 20,000 employees, and that his efforts to overhaul what he saw as an ineffective bureaucracy left the agency a chaotic mess. His proponents say he was done in by an old guard that was being sidelined.\par \par \uc2 General Flynn maintains that he was fired for insisting that Al Qaeda and other militant Islamists were regrouping in the Middle East and for refusing to fall in line with an administration that wanted to bask in the glow of having killed Osama bin Laden. His view of the threat posed by Islamist militancy has hardened in the two years since he was forced into retirement.\par \par \uc2 Yet General Flynn also talks of the need to strengthen relationships with predominantly Muslim countries and to better understand their cultures. Muslim countries are eager to play a bigger role in the fight against Islamist militancy, he said. What they are lacking is American leadership, he said, and Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  can provide it.\par \par \uc2 Find out what you need to know about the 2016 presidential race today, and get politics news updates via \uc2 Facebook\uc2 , \uc2 Twitter\uc2  and the First Draft newsletter.\par \par \uc2 Supporters of Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2  at a rally in Colorado Springs on Tuesday, a day before the third and final presidential debate.

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  could have shared the Democratic presidential ticket with \uc2 Bill Gates\uc2  -- or with his wife, Melinda. She could have named \uc2 Michael R. Bloomberg\uc2 , the billionaire former New York mayor, as her running mate. Or she could have chosen to reward a loyal friend and fund-raiser by making \uc2 Gov. Terry McAuliffe\uc2  of Virginia her No. 2.\par \par \uc2 All four were among the potential vice-presidential candidates Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's top campaign aides included in a first pass through their screening process, which turns out to have been well underway even before she amassed the delegates she needed to capture the nomination.\par \par \uc2 On March 17, just after Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  had defeated Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont in a string of primary contests, including those in Florida and Illinois, her campaign chairman, \uc2 John D. Podesta\uc2 , sent her a note of congratulations.\par \par \uc2 ''Ok, I can breathe again!'' he wrote in a hacked email released by \uc2 WikiLeaks\uc2  on Tuesday. ''Congrats on a fabulous night. I am feeling like it's possible to get back to the longer term again.''\par \par \uc2 Mr. Podesta updated Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  on the preparations for vetting potential running mates, including ''nondisclosure agreements with anyone we involve in the process,'' then rattled off a not-so-short list of vice-presidential prospects he and other aides had agreed to include in what he called a ''first cut.''\par \par \uc2 ''I have organized names in rough food groups,'' Mr. Podesta wrote.\par \par \uc2 It was a balanced diet, indeed: Clustered below were the Latinos, women, white male politicians -- including Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's eventual pick, Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia -- African-Americans, military men, business executives and philanthropists.\par \par \uc2 Thirty-ninth and last on the list, and in a category all by himself, was Mr. Sanders.\par \par \uc2 The email, obtained by hackers who illegally breached Mr. Podesta's account, appears to have kicked into gear a closely guarded vetting process that stretched on for months.\par \par \uc2 At the time, it was not yet assured that \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2  would lock up the Republican nomination, and Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's aides included running mates who could bolster the Democratic ticket should she find herself in a general \uc2 election\uc2  against Senator Ted Cruz of Texas or even Gov. John Kasich of Ohio.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Podesta's list included many elected officials who were later reported to have been vetted, including the Obama administration cabinet secretaries Juli\u225\'00\'E1n Castro, Tom Perez and Tom Vilsack, and Senators Elizabeth Warren, Sherrod Brown, \uc2 Cory Booker\uc2  and Michael Bennet.\par \par \uc2 But other potential running mates -- including the chief executive of Apple, \uc2 Tim Cook\uc2 ; \uc2 Muhtar Kent\uc2 , the Turkish-American chief executive of Coca-Cola; and \uc2 Howard Schultz\uc2 , the chairman and chief executive of Starbucks -- would have been highly unconventional.\par \par \uc2 In the end, of course, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  settled on \uc2 Gov. Mike Pence\uc2  of Indiana as his running mate, and Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  faced little pressure to respond by demonstrating unpredictability or boldness with her own choice.\par \par \uc2 Find out what you need to know about the 2016 presidential race today, and get politics news updates via \uc2 Facebook\uc2 , \uc2 Twitter\uc2  and the First Draft newsletter.\par \par \uc2 A hacked email released on Tuesday by WikiLeaks listed potential vice-presidential candidates for Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , suggested in March by her campaign chairman, John D. Podesta. They included, clockwise from top left, Melinda Gates, Bill Gates, Tim Cook and Michael R. Bloomberg.

\par\par \uc2 National Desk; SECTA\par \b \uc2 Clinton\uc2  Hopes to Woo White Catholic Voters\b0\par\par\uc2 By JASON HOROWITZ \par \uc2 1,664 \uc2 words\par \uc2 19 October 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 13\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 PAOLI, Pa. -- Since the \uc2 election\uc2  of Ronald Reagan, white Roman Catholics have flocked to Republican nominees for a raft of reasons, including their stances on social issues like abortion and same-sex marriage.\par \par \uc2 But this year, something seems different.\par \par \uc2 ''\uc2 Trump\uc2  is the exception to the rule,'' Carol Robinson, 67, said as she left an afternoon prayer meeting in this Philadelphia suburb with other enthusiastic supporters of \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 . ''He's a loose cannon.''\par \par \uc2 Roman Catholics are the country's second-largest religious group after evangelical Protestants, and they are as diverse as the country itself, with young liberals, cultural conservatives and, increasingly, Democratic-leaning Hispanics.\par \par \uc2 But now, the \uc2 Clinton\uc2  campaign senses a rare opportunity to block Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's narrow path to victory by making inroads with a core part of the church: white Catholics, a prized group of voters that has defied predictions this year.\par \par \uc2 Though a string of polls had shown Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  opening a lead among white Catholics, a poll released last week by the Public Religion Research Institute showed Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  hemorrhaging support. The five-day poll, which ended two days after the release of a recording in which Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  joked about groping women, and before several women came forward to say he had forcibly kissed or touched them, showed him effectively tied with Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 . The poll showed 42 percent of white Catholics supported him, and 46 percent backed her, with a margin of sampling error of plus or minus four percentage points.\par \par \uc2 ''That's not where \uc2 Trump\uc2  wants to be in the homestretch, particularly with a core constituency in Midwestern battleground states,'' said Robert Jones, a Public Religion Research Institute pollster. He added that white Catholics, much more than the white evangelicals who have largely remained loyal to Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , seemed to be defying the Republican Party's customary pull.\par \par \uc2 Both campaigns see openings: Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  in hacked emails released last week in which members of the \uc2 Clinton\uc2  campaign spoke critically about Catholic conservatism, and Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  in Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's un-churchmanlike behavior and his tussling with \uc2 Pope Francis\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 The pope, on his way home from Mexico in February, suggested that Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  ''is not Christian'' if he preferred building barriers to building bridges. Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , not one to turn the other cheek, responded that Francis' remarks were ''disgraceful.''\par \par \uc2 The episode did not hurt Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's standing in the Republican primaries; in fact, many Catholics believed the pope was improperly meddling in American politics.\par \par \uc2 But Francis may be more quietly influencing the Catholic vote in other ways. He has moved the church to emphasize inclusion and the welfare of the poor over divisive issues like abortion and homosexuality. And his personnel changes have effectively left Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's conservative backers without much support from prominent Catholic clergy members.\par \par \uc2 ''It's a concern among a lot of Catholics that maybe we're not going to hear the kind of strong message that we heard in past elections,'' said \uc2 Frank Pavone\uc2 , a priest who runs an anti-abortion group and is advising Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 In 2004, a powerful group of archbishops publicly advocated the re-\uc2 election\uc2  of President George W. Bush. Archbishop Raymond Burke of St. Louis said that if given the chance, he would deny communion to Mr. Bush's opponent, Senator John Kerry, because of his abortion stance.\par \par \uc2 Pope Benedict XVI elevated Archbishop Burke to the rank of cardinal, but Francis has since essentially demoted him from his Vatican position. And when Cardinal Francis George, a combative voice on social issues from his high perch as the leader of the Chicago Archdiocese, took ill in 2014 (he died the next year), \uc2 Pope Francis\uc2  replaced him with the more inclusive Blase Cupich, who has focused his energies on climate change, gun control and immigration reform.\par \par \uc2 The pope announced this month that he would elevate Archbishop Cupich to the rank of cardinal, while passing over the United States' reigning conservative heavyweight, Archbishop Charles J. Chaput of Philadelphia, who has remained outspoken in his criticism of Catholic politicians who support abortion rights.\par \par \uc2 Prominent Catholic lawmakers are now targeting voters on behalf of the \uc2 Clinton\uc2  campaign. This month, Senator Richard J. Durbin, Democrat of Illinois, held a round-table discussion with nuns in Dubuque, Iowa. The campaign has also created ''heritage'' outreach programs to try to appeal to voters with immigrant backgrounds, such as Irish and Italian, who are often Catholic.\par \par \uc2 The director of the \uc2 Clinton\uc2  campaign's Catholic outreach program, John McCarthy, said lay Catholic leaders he had met with in Dubuque repeatedly said they were uncomfortable with Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 . ''The divisive rhetoric is what is really pushing people away,'' Mr. McCarthy said.\par \par \uc2 But the \uc2 Trump\uc2  campaign has done its own outreach.\par \par \uc2 ''I have a message for Catholics: I will be there for you,'' Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  wrote in an open letter to the Annual Catholic Leadership Conference meeting this month in Denver. ''I am, and will remain, pro-life. I will defend your religious liberties and the right to fully and freely practice your religion, as individuals, business owners and academic institutions.''\par \par \uc2 In March, Joseph Cella, a founder of Fidelis, a Catholic advocacy organization, added his name to an open letter calling Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  ''unfit to be president'' because his ''demagoguery'' and ''appeals to racial and ethnic fears and prejudice are offensive to any genuinely Catholic sensibility.''\par \par \uc2 But he said he had undergone a ''sincere change of heart and mind'' to Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's mission since then, and today, he is the campaign's liaison to a group of Catholic advisers. On Tuesday, he released a statement calling on Catholics to pray the rosary daily until the \uc2 election\uc2  for unity, peace and a \uc2 Trump\uc2  victory.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Cella said he was sticking by Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  despite the recent revelations of his vulgar comments about women and accusations from several women that he had forcibly touched or kissed them.\par \par \uc2 On ''Face the Nation'' on Oct. 9, \uc2 Rudolph W. Giuliani\uc2 , a former mayor of New York and a Catholic, who is one of Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's closest confidants, asked the host, John Dickerson, ''Ever read the 'Confessions' of St. Augustine?''\par \par \uc2 ''Men can change, people can change,'' Mr. Giuliani said.\par \par \uc2 Even Catholics who have found Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's language and ideas abhorrent are not necessarily abandoning him. ''He's a child, rude,'' said Rose Benner, 85, after she emerged from Mass at St. Patrick Church in Malvern, Pa., one recent morning. ''He doesn't understand other people, and he sees women as play toys.''\par \par \uc2 But, she added, ''I'm a Catholic, and I'm pro-life. I have to vote for \uc2 Trump\uc2  because he will appoint Supreme Court justices. That's the only reason. My whole family will vote for \uc2 Trump\uc2  because of that.''\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 Trump\uc2  campaign is also courting Catholic conservatives by highlighting a recent comment from Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's running mate, Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia -- himself an observant Catholic -- that the church will one day support same-sex marriage. And it is making the most of every mention of Catholicism in the hacked \uc2 Clinton\uc2  campaign emails being released by \uc2 WikiLeaks\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 In one 2011 conversation about \uc2 Rupert Murdoch\uc2  in particular and prominent Catholics in general, Jennifer Palmieri, who later became the communications director of the \uc2 Clinton\uc2  campaign, wrote: ''I imagine they think it is the most socially acceptable politically conservative religion. Their rich friends wouldn't understand if they became evangelicals.''\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 Trump\uc2  campaign has also highlighted a 2012 email urging \uc2 John D. Podesta\uc2 , a former president of the Center for American Progress, to ''plant the seeds of the revolution'' against ''Middle Ages dictatorship'' within the Catholic church. Mr. Podesta, who is now Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's campaign chairman, responded by writing that he and his allies had created groups for just such a purpose.\par \par \uc2 Veteran church observers have noted that those emails spoke to a longstanding rift in the church between social conservatives who emphasize abortion and liberal Catholics more concerned about social justice.\par \par \uc2 But at a campaign rally last week in Ocala, Fla., Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  portrayed the emails as an attack on religion. ''They attack Catholics and evangelicals,'' he said. ''Viciously.''\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  himself was not so sensitive to Catholic feelings while on ''The \uc2 Howard Stern\uc2  Show'' in 2013, shortly after Pope Benedict announced he would resign.\par \par \uc2 ''He should just give up and die,'' Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  said, according to a recording obtained by The \uc2 Washington Post\uc2 . ''He looks so bad.''\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 Clinton\uc2  campaign, noting the silence of many bishops in this \uc2 election\uc2  and the candidate's improving poll numbers, hopes Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  is so off-putting to white Catholics that they will overlook the emails and Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's stances on abortion and other social issues.\par \par \uc2 Outside Paoli's Daylesford Abbey, where paintings on the walls for a coming art show include a $10,000 oil of \uc2 Pope Francis\uc2 , Ms. Robinson, the \uc2 Clinton\uc2  supporter, said she thought Francis had made it easier for her fellow Catholics to turn away from Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 And Tony Prosperi, a sheet metal worker who attended an event last week featuring Mr. Kaine, at his union hall in Philadelphia, said Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's fight with the pope had crossed a sacred line.\par \par \uc2 ''It doesn't matter if you are Catholic,'' he said. ''There are a few people who you have to respect.''\par \par \uc2 Find out what you need to know about the 2016 presidential race today, and get politics news updates via \uc2 Facebook\uc2 , \uc2 Twitter\uc2  and the First Draft newsletter.\par \par \uc2 Clockwise from top, St. Patrick Church in Malvern, Pa.; Rose Benner, outside St. Patrick, called Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2  ''rude'' but said she would vote for him because of his stand on abortion; Carol Robinson, outside Daylesford Abbey in Paoli, Pa., called Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  ''a loose cannon'' and said she thought Pope Francis had made it easier for Roman Catholics to turn away from him.

\par\par \uc2 Foreign Desk; SECTA\par \b \uc2 Ecuador Cuts Assange's Link to the Internet\b0\par\par\uc2 By STEVEN ERLANGER and DAVID E. SANGER; Steven Erlanger reported from London, and David E. Sanger from Washington. Nicholas Casey contributed reporting from Caracas, Venezuela. \par \uc2 1,350 \uc2 words\par \uc2 19 October 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 1\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 LONDON -- Ecuador said Tuesday that it had cut off Julian Assange's access to the internet in his exile in the country's London embassy, making clear that it feared being sucked into an effort to ''interfere in electoral processes'' in the United States by the activities of the \uc2 WikiLeaks\uc2  founder.\par \par \uc2 Ecuador said that it was not evicting Mr. Assange from its embassy, where he sought asylum four years ago. It said that its ''temporary restriction'' of internet services to Mr. Assange ''does not prevent the \uc2 WikiLeaks\uc2  organization from carrying out its journalistic activities.''\par \par \uc2 But it was clearly intended to keep the embassy from being the control center for that leaking operation. ''The government of Ecuador respects the principle of nonintervention in the affairs of other countries,'' it said in a statement, ''and it does not interfere in the electoral processes in support of any candidate in particular.''\par \par \uc2 The internet cutoff was the latest twist in the odd tale of Mr. Assange's self-imposed exile, which began in 2012 when he sought refuge from a Swedish rape investigation that he said was a cover for an American effort to extradite him. Since then, his world has shrunk to a single apartment inside the small diplomatic compound in central London. He has communicated through the embassy's internet connections, visitors and, presumably, cellphones that would give him another form of internet access.\par \par \uc2 Ecuador's decision was the first sign that the government in Quito was beginning to wonder if its guest in London was overstaying his welcome.\par \par \uc2 It doubtless was considering the possibility that, should \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  prevail in the United States \uc2 election\uc2  next month, it would have to explain its role as host to the man who, by remote control, appears to have coordinated the publication of emails purloined from people close to Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , along with those of the \uc2 Democratic National Committee\uc2  and other organizations.\par \par \uc2 The announcement came a day after \uc2 WikiLeaks\uc2  said that Mr. Assange's connection to the internet had been severed shortly after the organization published speeches that \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  gave to \uc2 Goldman Sachs\uc2 , the global investment firm. The transcripts, the latest in a series of disclosures, appear to have come from the hacked email account of \uc2 John D. Podesta\uc2 , the chairman of her campaign and a White House chief of staff when Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's husband was president.\par \par \uc2 The statement clearly sought to separate Ecuador from the decision by \uc2 WikiLeaks\uc2  to publish Mr. Podesta's emails and, before that, those hacked from the national committee and elsewhere. In recent weeks, Mr. Assange, once the hero of the American left for exposing classified State Department and Pentagon documents, has been hailed by \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2  and his advisers for disclosures from Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's campaign, which Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  has used almost daily to fuel his attacks on her.\par \par \uc2 American intelligence agencies have said that the D.N.C. hack was the work of the Russian government and had to be approved at the highest levels of the Kremlin. But it is unclear how the documents made it to \uc2 WikiLeaks\uc2 , which has never said where the emails came from, if it knows.\par \par \uc2 Only hours before Ecuador's announcement, \uc2 WikiLeaks\uc2  charged that Secretary of State \uc2 John Kerry\uc2  quietly urged the Ecuadorean government, in a meeting late last month, to stop Mr. Assange from publishing the emails or interfering in the \uc2 election\uc2 . The State Department issued a statement declaring that the reports were untrue.\par \par \uc2 Ecuador's action, experts inside and outside the United States government say, is not likely to slow the flow of leaked emails. Those emails are routed through servers around the globe, and if the United States wanted to shut them down covertly, that presumably would have happened years ago.\par \par \uc2 In fact, American officials have said, turning off the flow of \uc2 WikiLeaks\uc2  data is a legally complicated issue, especially if American citizens or American-based firms are involved. The Obama administration, they say, does not want to be accused of suppressing unwelcome speech -- in the manner of the Russians and the Chinese.\par \par \uc2 Efforts to reach \uc2 WikiLeaks\uc2  on Tuesday were unsuccessful. A sometimes spokesman, Kristinn Hrafnsson, did not return messages, and a telephone message and an email message to Sunshine Press, which represents Mr. Assange, were also unanswered.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Assange has insisted he does not know the source of the \uc2 WikiLeaks\uc2  material, though he has made no secret of his distaste for Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 . The United States government has said that much of the hacking was the work of Russian intelligence and was part of a broad effort to influence the \uc2 election\uc2 . So far, the White House has not announced how it will respond, though several options have been discussed with President \uc2 Obama\uc2 , according to administration officials.\par \par \uc2 On Sunday, in a taped interview broadcast on \uc2 NBC\uc2 's ''Meet the Press,'' Vice President \uc2 Joseph R. Biden Jr\uc2 ., in what was either a warning or an effort at psychological warfare, said that ''we're sending a message'' to the Russians ''at a time and place of our choosing'' and that President \uc2 Vladimir V. Putin\uc2  will ''know it'' when the message arrives. That seemed to suggest some kind of covert action, perhaps a cyberstrike, in retaliation for what the American intelligence community has described as a broad and unprecedented effort by a foreign power to influence American voters.\par \par \uc2 It is possible that Ecuador feared that, because of its decision to give exile to Mr. Assange, it risked becoming a witting or unwitting participant in an effort at voter manipulation.\par \par \uc2 WikiLeaks\uc2  provided no evidence to support its claim that Mr. Kerry had pressured Ecuadorean officials, during a private meeting in Colombia last month, to clamp down on Mr. Assange, and the State Department's spokesman, John Kirby, immediately denied the accusation. ''Reports that Secretary Kerry had conversations with Ecuadorean officials about this are simply untrue. Period,'' he said.\par \par \uc2 The president of Ecuador, Rafael Correa, is a man of the left, and he recently told the Kremlin-backed broadcaster RT that he would support Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 At the same time, he suggested in the interview that a victory by Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , who has made no secret of his admiration for Mr. Putin, would be good for Latin America because it would, paradoxically, bolster leftist parties.\par \par \uc2 ''I sincerely believe that it would be better for Latin America if \uc2 Trump\uc2  won,'' Mr. Correa said. ''When did progressive governments come to power in Latin America? During the Bush administration. His primitive policies were rejected so much that it caused reaction in Latin America. \uc2 Trump\uc2  would do the same.''\par \par \uc2 Questions to the Ecuadorean Embassy on Tuesday were met with a reference to the embassy's website and a brief statement.\par \par \uc2 ''In view of recent speculations, the government of Ecuador reaffirms the validity of the asylum granted four years ago to Julian Assange,'' the statement said.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Assange is the subject of an arrest warrant in Sweden, which wanted to question him about allegations of rape and sexual abuse dating to 2010, to decide whether or not to bring charges.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Assange, saying that he feared extradition to the United States on espionage charges stemming from the publication by \uc2 WikiLeaks\uc2  of secret documents given to the website by the former Army analyst Chelsea Manning, broke bail and took refuge in the Ecuadorean Embassy in June 2012. He has been in the tiny embassy since.\par \par \uc2 Given the statute of limitations, the one allegation Mr. Assange still faces in Sweden is rape. He is wanted for questioning but has not been charged.\par \par \uc2 There is no public indictment in the United States of Mr. Assange; if Sweden chose not to press charges, he would presumably be free to leave the embassy.\par \par \uc2 Follow Steven Erlanger on Twitter @StevenErlanger .\par \par \uc2 Julian Assange in February at the Ecuadorean Embassy in London, where he is in exile.

\par\par \b \uc2 World News: WikiLeaks Founder's Isolation Deepens --- Julian Assange, under fire for breaches of privacy, loses his connection to internet\b0\par\par\uc2 By Robert McMillan and Jennifer Valentino-DeVries   \par \uc2 724 \uc2 words\par \uc2 19 October 2016\par \uc2 The Wall Street Journal\par \uc2 J\par A7\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 Ecuador's decision to pull the plug on Julian Assange's internet connection has highlighted the isolation of \uc2 WikiLeaks\uc2 , the organization he founded to expose the inner workings of governments and other powerful institutions.\par \par \uc2 Some former allies and observers say that after four years confined to the Ecuadorean Embassy in London, Mr. Assange is alienating former supporters and undermining \uc2 WikiLeaks\uc2 's relevance. They cite a series of leaks they say supported Russian efforts to disrupt the U.S. \uc2 election\uc2  and carelessly promoted Turkish government documents exposing personal information of thousands of ordinary citizens.\par \par \uc2 WikiLeaks\uc2  "has pioneered open government but has now gone off the rails in a way that damages the global transparency movement," said Alex Howard, a senior analyst at the Sunlight Foundation, a group once sympathetic to \uc2 WikiLeaks\uc2  that backs open-government efforts in the U.S.\par \par \uc2 WikiLeaks\uc2 's relationship with Russia has come under particular scrutiny lately after the release of thousands of documents from the \uc2 Democratic National Committee\uc2  and allies of Democratic presidential candidate \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 . On Monday, \uc2 WikiLeaks\uc2  released a new batch of emails that it alleged were sent or received from \uc2 John Podesta\uc2 , a top campaign adviser for Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 U.S. government\uc2  officials have accused Russia of conducting those intrusions as part of an effort to influence the U.S. \uc2 election\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 There is no evidence of collusion between Russia and \uc2 WikiLeaks\uc2 , said Nicholas Weaver, a researcher at the International Computer Science Institute at the University of California, Berkeley. "However, Assange has made it very clear that he's willing to be a useful idiot for any intelligence service, as long as it furthers his own agenda," he said.\par \par \uc2 The Ecuadorean government, in a statement late Tuesday explaining its decision, said that the country doesn't interfere in external electoral processes and so was temporarily restricting "access to some of its private communication network" within the embassy.\par \par \uc2 WikiLeaks\uc2  had earlier accused the Ecuadorean government of severing Mr. Assange's internet connection at the behest of U.S. Secretary of State \uc2 John Kerry\uc2 . A State Department spokesman rejected the assertion as false.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Assange still exerts vast influence on the global debate. Others conducting their own disruptive document leaks follow a game plan Mr. Assange sketched out a decade ago.\par \par \uc2 "Consider what would happen if one of these [political] parties gave up their mobile phones, fax and email correspondence -- let alone the computer systems which manage their subscribers, donors, budgets, polling, call centers and direct mail Campaigns," Mr. Assange wrote when founding \uc2 WikiLeaks\uc2  in 2006. "They would immediately fall into an organizational stupor and lose to the other."\par \par \uc2 Representatives of \uc2 WikiLeaks\uc2  and Mr. Assange didn't respond to multiple requests to comment.\par \par \uc2 WikiLeaks\uc2  has long billed itself as a news organization. In its early days, it revealed documents ranging from Scientology manuals to the internal emails of climate researchers. But it became best known for information related to \uc2 U.S. government\uc2  policy.\par \par \uc2 The emergence of alternative outlets for publishing such material makes Mr. Assange less central. Others published two of the most important leaks in recent years -- the Panama Papers documents taken from the \uc2 Mossack Fonseca & Co\uc2 . law firm and Edward Snowden's trove of \uc2 National Security Agency\uc2  documents.\par \par \uc2 WikiLeaks\uc2  once joined with news organizations and used volunteers to purge personal information from data it published. But Mr. Assange later came to view former partners, including the \uc2 New York Times\uc2  and Britain's Guardian, as enemies after disputes over their handling of \uc2 WikiLeaks\uc2  material, former Assange confidant Andrew O'Hagan wrote in 2014. A Guardian representative said it last worked with \uc2 WikiLeaks\uc2  in 2010. Mr. O'Hagan and \uc2 New York Times\uc2  representatives didn't respond to requests to comment.\par \par \uc2 In July, Turkish human-rights activists criticized \uc2 WikiLeaks\uc2  for a \uc2 Twitter\uc2  message that linked to a cache of documents containing sensitive information belonging to private citizens. Some academics and activists also faulted the organization for including phone numbers, credit-card information and passport numbers in other data releases it published this year. Such actions have eroded \uc2 WikiLeaks\uc2 's support among some advocates of transparency and privacy.\par \par \uc2 ---\par \par \uc2 James Marson in Moscow contributed to this article.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=wjco20161019000122"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document J000000020161019ecaj00035\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw272\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4080\pichgoal600

\par\par \b \uc2 Can Republicans Flip Harry Reid's Seat?\b0\par\par\uc2 By Kate Bachelder Odell   \par \uc2 1,274 \uc2 words\par \uc2 19 October 2016\par \uc2 The Wall Street Journal\par \uc2 J\par A13\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 Las Vegas -- Joe Heck is facing long odds, even for Vegas: The three-term Nevada congressman is running for the Senate against the chosen heir to Minority Leader Harry Reid, who over the past 30 years has put away five Republican opponents. The Reid machine is hellbent on passing the retiring senator's seat to a Democrat and leaving Washington with a new liberal Senate majority. Mr. Reid says he has a "proprietary" interest in the outcome, and his staff is running the campaign of the Democratic nominee, Catherine Cortez Masto, a former Nevada attorney general.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Heck will appear on the ballot with the most divisive and unpopular GOP presidential nominee in modern history. As a special bonus, the Nevada ballot gives disgusted voters the option to select "none of these candidates" -- a choice that is polling in the mid-single digits. Earlier this month, Mr. Heck pulled his support for \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  and called for \uc2 the New Yorker\uc2  to step down. Nevada is also a microcosm of the GOP's demographic challenges. Hispanics might constitute 20% of the electorate this year, up from 15% in 2008.\par \par \uc2 Yet Mr. Heck could win. He's running nearly even with Ms. Cortez Masto -- 41% to her 43% in the latest Real Clear Politics average. There are several reasons he's competitive: Mr. Heck is a sharp and disciplined candidate, his opponent has no discernible ideas, and he's running to expand the GOP's appeal.\par \par \uc2 Sen. Reid first won his Senate seat in 1986 on the slogan "Independent Like Nevada." That's a punch line now that Mr. Reid has become the most visceral partisan in Washington. But it's true of the state: Nevada has voted for the winner in all but two presidential contests since 1908, the third time William Jennings Bryan carried the Silver State. \uc2 Barack Obama\uc2  won Nevada in 2012 with 52%, but that year Republican Sen. Dean Heller eked out re-\uc2 election\uc2  by about 10,000 votes. (Sen. Heller's opponent was ensnared in an ethics investigation, which helped.)\par \par \uc2 A majority of Nevadans live in or around Las Vegas's Clark County, a metropolitan area pounded by the 2008 recession. More than 400 miles north is the swing county of Washoe, in Reno, where residents are known for disdaining bossy politicians. About 85% of state acreage is owned by the federal government, and the \uc2 U.S. Navy\uc2  "Top Gun" fighter school is out in the desert east of Reno.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Heck, whose district spans the suburbs of Las Vegas, is a brigadier general in the \uc2 U.S. Army Reserve\uc2 , physician and former business owner. So Democrats are having a rough time making this guy look like an evil Republican: Mr. Heck ran a combat support hospital in Iraq; this week he left the campaign trail to report for reserve duty. Last month in West Virginia a semi-truck smashed into three cars in front of Mr. Heck and Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, who were driving from an event. The pair pulled over and helped one victim escape the wreckage. Mr. Heck treated others until emergency responders arrived.\par \par \uc2 Ms. Cortez Masto's biographical notes are less inspiring. She spent eight years as Nevada's attorney general before being named executive vice chancellor of the state's university system, despite never having worked at a college. Her entire campaign is predicated on attaching Mr. Heck to \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , but she and \uc2 the New Yorker\uc2  have at least one thing in common: Ms. Cortez Masto has tried to jail a political opponent.\par \par \uc2 As attorney general in 2008, she indicted then-Lieutenant Governor Brian Krolicki on felony charges of mishandling public money. As it happens, Mr. Krolicki looked likely to challenge Sen. Reid in 2010. A judge threw Ms. Cortez Masto off the case, and it emerged that her husband had planned a fundraiser for Mr. Krolicki's opponent for lieutenant governor. A district court dismissed the charges against Mr. Krolicki, but the indictment's damage protected Sen. Reid.\par \par \uc2 Perhaps as thanks, Mr. Reid selected Ms. Cortez Masto to inherit his seat; it clearly wasn't because of her policy acumen or political skill. At a debate Friday in Las Vegas, Ms. Cortez Masto unloaded this free association about Mr. Heck's plan to repeal the mandates and penalties in ObamaCare: "We're not talking about preventive care anymore. The premiums are going to skyrocket under his plan. That's the difference here, you know, again, he's a typical Washington politician." Voters understand that premiums are already skyrocketing -- thanks to ObamaCare. Mr. Heck suggested a tax credit to help Americans buy insurance in the private market. Ms. Cortez Masto proposed nothing.\par \par \uc2 The question is whether ideas matter in the Year of \uc2 Trump\uc2 , and the dispiriting answer is that they don't. The Cortez Masto campaign is hammering Mr. Heck for initially sticking with Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  and then walking away. Democrats hope that \uc2 Trump\uc2  supporters will refuse to vote for Mr. Heck -- and that undecided voters will break against him because of his past endorsement.\par \par \uc2 Yet one GOP internal poll last week suggested that Mr. Heck's unendorsement is a wash: Nearly 70% of voters said it made no difference to them. And Mr. Heck has one advantage, which is the enduring loathing of Harry Reid. Less than 40% of Nevadans have a favorable view of their senior senator. Even the most ardent Trumpians may decide that defeating the minority leader's protege is the better political revenge.\par \par \uc2 There is also evidence that Mr. Heck can expand his coalition beyond traditional Republicans. In 2012 he won re-\uc2 election\uc2  even as President Obama carried his district, which is 15% Hispanic and 11% Asian. In 2014 Mr. Heck won again -- by more than 20 points, while taking nearly 40% of the Hispanic vote.\par \par \uc2 Ms. Cortez Masto would be the first Latina U.S. senator, but Mr. Heck is campaigning among Hispanics and Asians across the state; he has been endorsed by the leader of the Latin Chamber of Commerce, who in the past supported Sen. Reid. Mr. Heck tells me that he subscribes to the "big tent" view of the GOP.\par \par \uc2 Many Republicans, he adds, "really don't do anything in those communities until maybe two months before an \uc2 election\uc2 . And then they want to go knock on a door and try to earn a vote. Which, of course, they aren't successful in doing, because their activity is seen for what it is." He says GOP candidates who embed in Asian and Hispanic communities early and while in office will learn that many of them "are Republicans -- they just don't realize it yet."\par \par \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  and \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  are descending on Las Vegas for the final presidential debate on Wednesday, and who knows what fresh \uc2 Trump\uc2  news could wreck Republicans' chances over the next 20 days. But a last word about Nevada's confounding realities: Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  is trailing Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  in the polls by less than five points, though the state is home to a large population of Mormons, who aren't warm to his charms. No one in Nevada seems to care about Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's trade fatwas; the state economy is largely built on services, less so on manufacturing. Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's deportation promises aren't popular, either.\par \par \uc2 In other words, Silver State voters defy normal political categories. Maybe they'll reject the received wisdom that no one can beat Harry Reid.\par \par \uc2 ---\par \par \uc2 Ms. Odell is an editorial writer for the Journal.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=wjco20161019000102"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document J000000020161019ecaj0002l\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw272\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4080\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 GRAND JUNCTION, Colo. -- Republican \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  maintained that a loss by him in next month's presidential \uc2 election\uc2  would indicate the vote is rigged, while President \uc2 Barack Obama\uc2  countered that "no serious person" would suggest the U.S. electoral system was fraudulent.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , speaking Tuesday at rallies in Colorado, also escalated his attacks on the political establishment by vowing to push for a constitutional amendment limiting service for members of Congress. He said that would "break the cycle of corruption" in Washington.\par \par \uc2 The Republican nominee's claims of malfeasance in this year's \uc2 election\uc2 , for which he has presented no evidence, have unsettled officials from both political parties. Mr. Obama, speaking at a White House press conference, noted that U.S. elections are decentralized and monitored by the parties, and he suggested the GOP candidate "stop whining" and make his case to voters.\par \par \uc2 "I have never seen in my lifetime or in modern political history any presidential candidate trying to discredit the elections and the \uc2 election\uc2  process before votes have even taken place," Mr. Obama said.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  also has sought to shift responsibility for a potential loss to the media, while trying to convince his supporters that he is doing better against Democrat \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  than polls show. He pointed to the U.K.'s June vote to leave the \uc2 European Union\uc2 , which caught many observers off guard.\par \par \uc2 "I don't believe the polls anymore," Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  said Tuesday. "Believe me, folks, we're doing great."\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  said he would propose a six-year limit for House members and 12 years for senators. He also proposed a ban on White House and congressional officials from raising campaign money during "working hours."\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=wjco20161019000100"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document J000000020161019ecaj0002j\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw272\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4080\pichgoal600

\par\par \b \uc2 Election\uc2  2016: Reid, \uc2 Trump\uc2  Overshadow Nevada Race\b0\par\par\uc2 By Alexandra Berzon   \par \uc2 655 \uc2 words\par \uc2 19 October 2016\par \uc2 The Wall Street Journal\par \uc2 J\par A6\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 LAS VEGAS -- Two men not on the ticket -- Republican presidential nominee \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  and departing Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid -- could help determine who wins Nevada's tightly contested Senate race and which party emerges with control of the chamber.\par \par \uc2 Rep. Joe Heck, the Republican running to succeed Mr. Reid, withdrew his endorsement of Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  after a 2005 videotape surfaced of the New York businessman making lewd comments about grabbing and kissing women without their consent. "My hope is that this will not divide us and that we can unite behind principles, Republican principles," he said at a campaign rally, reading from notes.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Heck, a doctor and Army Reserve brigadier general whose district covers much of suburban Las Vegas, was heckled by people who shouted "Who are you to judge?" and "So disappointed in you!"\par \par \uc2 Catherine Cortez Masto, his Democratic rival and a former state attorney general, took issue at a debate a few days later with Mr. Heck's explanation that he was motivated by treating victims of domestic violence and the experience of his wife, herself a victim of domestic violence in a prior relationship.\par \par \uc2 "Let's call this what it is," Ms. Cortez Masto said. "Congressman Heck is worried about his political career. \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2 's ship is sinking."\par \par \uc2 Republicans have long eyed the end of Mr. Reid's 30-year Senate career as an opportunity to pick up a seat as they battle elsewhere to maintain their majority in the chamber. But the 52-year-old Ms. Cortez Masto has inched ahead in polls after the \uc2 Trump\uc2  video was released. A net gain of five seats (or four if \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  wins the presidency) would put the Democrats back in charge of the Senate.\par \par \uc2 Groups backing Mr. Heck have run ads portraying Ms. Cortez Masto, who would be the first Latina senator if elected, as weak on crime and law enforcement in her eight years as attorney general. In contrast, she has highlighted her battles with banks who foreclosed on homes as well as her intention to raise the minimum wage.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Heck's campaign has focused on his medical experience and testimonials from constituents who say they helped them through various crises. He has done outreach to Latino voters and has spoken of his support for immigration reform, including a path to citizenship.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Reid has in recent weeks sent top aides to help support Ms. Cortez Masto and plans to stump for her until \uc2 election\uc2  day, attempting to build enthusiasm among the Democratic base, including Latino voters. He said in an interview that Ms. Cortez Masto was the first person he called when he decided last year to retire because he wanted her to enter the race. He was friends with her father, a powerful county commissioner who died in 2006, and has known her since she was a child.\par \par \uc2 "She reminds me of \uc2 Dianne Feinstein\uc2 ," Mr. Reid said, drawing a comparison to the California Democratic senator. "She's not pushy, not reticent. She's just right."\par \par \uc2 Yet Mr. Reid, who polls show is a polarizing figure in the state, is also one of Mr. Heck's major talking points. "It's clear I have two opponents," he said in an interview before he rescinded his support of Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 . "The name on the ballot and Harry Reid."\par \par \uc2 Mr. Reid has sought for more than a decade to build the state party apparatus, but it was hit hard by the 2014 midterm \uc2 election\uc2  when Republicans swept state offices and knocked out a bench of rising Democratic stars.\par \par \uc2 Ms. Cortez Masto's campaign spent last week highlighting defections from Mr. Heck among \uc2 Trump\uc2  supporters, including listeners who called in to conservative radio shows and a Republican Party committeewoman for Nevada. "He lost the race when he did that," said one.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=wjco20161019000099"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document J000000020161019ecaj0002i\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw272\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4080\pichgoal600

\par\par \b \uc2 Election\uc2  2016: Democrats Eye Big Gain in House Seats\b0\par\par\uc2 By Kristina Peterson and Michelle Hackman   \par \uc2 673 \uc2 words\par \uc2 19 October 2016\par \uc2 The Wall Street Journal\par \uc2 J\par A6\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 WASHINGTON -- \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2 's tumbling poll numbers have given Democrats their strongest tailwinds in a decade, heightening expectations for significant gains in the House, though likely not enough in the eyes of most analysts to shift control of the chamber.\par \par \uc2 Republicans have sought to contain the down-ballot damage, with some distancing themselves from the top of the ticket completely after a 2005 video emerged in which Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  made lewd sexual remarks and women said he touched them inappropriately. Speaker \uc2 Paul Ryan\uc2  has said he is now focused on maintaining GOP control of Congress, and won't campaign with Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 "It is indisputable that we are going to pick up far more seats than anybody originally believed," said Rep. Steve Israel of New York, a former chairman of House Democrats' campaign arm.\par \par \uc2 Most analysts believe that even if \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  wins in a landslide, Democrats are unlikely to pick up the net 30 seats they would need to regain the House majority they lost in the tea party-fueled wave of the 2010 \uc2 election\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 "I haven't seen a wholesale shift in the landscape," said \uc2 David Wasserman\uc2 , who tracks House races for the nonpartisan Cook Political Report. He forecasts a net gain of between 10 and 20 seats for Democrats. But, he added, "there are races that have become much tighter because Republicans have failed to distance themselves from \uc2 Trump\uc2  or haven't run good races to separate themselves."\par \par \uc2 The pressure is intensifying on Republicans such as Rep. John Mica of Florida who is being challenged by Democrat Stephanie Murphy, a former national security analyst at the Defense Department.\par \par \uc2 Court-ordered redistricting in 2014 added more younger and racially diverse constituents to the district Mr. Mica, 73 years old, has represented since 1993. Ms. Murphy, 38, has argued she would be a better advocate on gun-control and gay rights issues in the wake of the June mass shooting at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando, located less than a block outside the district. Mr. Mica has framed the incident as a national security concern.\par \par \uc2 Soheila Mohammadian, a pharmacist from Orlando, said she didn't know much about Mr. Mica, but felt turned off by his continued support of Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 . "We Americans, we're Democrat, Republican, white, black, Latino and non-Latino, Muslim and non-Muslim," said Ms. Mohammadian, who plans to vote for Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  has been a bigger weight in wealthier, white-collar districts represented by Republicans like Mr. Mica and Reps. \uc2 Darrell Issa\uc2  of California than in blue-collar districts with more of the working-class white voters who have flocked in larger numbers to Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Democrats have ratcheted up their efforts to tie GOP incumbents to Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 . At least four Democratic candidates have aired ads using footage of the 2005 video. The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee also has crafted new ads criticizing Republicans who denounced Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  this month, saying they waited too long to act.\par \par \uc2 Still, voters aren't responding to the latest twists in the presidential campaign by flocking en masse to Democrats. Asked in the latest Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll which party they would want to control Congress after next month's elections, 46% of the registered voters favored a Democratic-led Congress; 44% backed a GOP-led Congress.\par \par \uc2 The current two-point advantage is dwarfed by the margin in polls in years past when Democrats picked up large numbers of House seats. In 2006, voters wanted a Democratic-led Congress by 10 percentage points in Journal/NBC polling, and the party gained 30 seats.\par \par \uc2 "I feel very confident that we will keep the majority even if our majority does shrink a little," said Rep. Steve Stivers (R., Ohio), who is in the running to be the next chairman of House Republicans' campaign arm. "Most voters want a Republican Congress regardless of who's president."\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=wjco20161019000098"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document J000000020161019ecaj0002h\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw272\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4080\pichgoal600

Mr. Schneider's race against Republican Rep.

Another group consisted of black candidates, including New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker and former U.S. Attorney General \uc2 Eric Holder\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Mr. Podesta also put forward names of seven women who could fill the position, including Sens.

\par\par \b \uc2 Election\uc2  2016: Millennials Aren't Fired Up --- Presidential race spurs less interest than the last two campaigns, a worry for \uc2 Clinton\uc2  team\b0\par\par\uc2 By Dante Chinni   \par \uc2 656 \uc2 words\par \uc2 19 October 2016\par \uc2 The Wall Street Journal\par \uc2 J\par A4\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 CHARLOTTESVILLE, Va. -- In a busy corridor in Nau Hall, \uc2 University of Virginia\uc2  sophomore Athena Post sat after class and lamented her 2016 presidential options.\par \par \uc2 "I'm just very disappointed with the two major-party candidates," Ms. Post said. "I think the \uc2 election\uc2  is a symbol of everything that is wrong with politics."\par \par \uc2 She is planning to vote for Democrat \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  in November, but she senses a lack of interest among many of her friends, even after the allegations about Republican \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2 's behavior toward women in the past few weeks.\par \par \uc2 "That hasn't necessarily led people to in turn support \uc2 Clinton\uc2 ," she said. "Some students don't feel the need or motivation to vote, because neither candidate is appealing to them."\par \par \uc2 For Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , who leads in national and battleground-state polls, that attitude could be a problem come November. In the last two presidential campaigns, this city and its large university have reliably produced Democratic votes and enthusiasm. Student interest soared in President \uc2 Barack Obama\uc2 's campaigns, which he won here by more than 50 points in 2008 and 2012. The number of voters registered and votes cast reached record levels.\par \par \uc2 The 2016 race, however, doesn't seem to be generating those levels of excitement among the student population. In a new Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll, only 54% of voters under age 35 rated themselves highly interested, down from 60% in 2012 and well below the 72% of voters in the full electorate.\par \par \uc2 "I don't see the enthusiasm we saw even in 2012, and certainly not the kind of enthusiasm we saw in 2008," said Ken Stroupe, director of the Youth Leadership Initiative at the university's Center for Politics. Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  and Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , he said, "are from a different generation. It's almost like younger voters are borrowing their parent's car. That's nice, but not exciting."\par \par \uc2 In the new Journal/NBC News poll, conducted Oct. 10-13, Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  led Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  among 18- to 29-year-old likely voters by 13 percentage points, 43% to 30%. That is narrower than Mr. Obama's 23-point margin over GOP nominee \uc2 Mitt Romney\uc2  with that age group in 2012.\par \par \uc2 In 2012, Mr. Obama relied heavily on college towns in the battleground states he won.\par \par \uc2 Daniel Folsom, a third-year student and \uc2 Clinton\uc2  supporter, believes the problem Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  faces is the implicit comparison with Mr. Obama. "It's the Obama factor. He's inspiring and a great speaker," Mr. Folsom said.\par \par \uc2 And students have other options: Libertarian \uc2 Gary Johnson\uc2  and the Green Party's Jill Stein are catching the eyes of many in the college set.\par \par \uc2 In the latest Journal/NBC News poll, those third-party candidates did much better among younger voters than with voters overall. Mr. Johnson and Ms. Stein draw 22% of likely voters ages 18 to 29. Among voters overall, they draw only 9% support.\par \par \uc2 The problems with campus enthusiasm aren't limited to Democrats. Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  has divided the University of Virginia College Republicans, said Turner LaBrie, director of communications and recruitment for the group.\par \par \uc2 When College Republicans held a vote this fall on whether they should endorse Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , the result was a nail-biter -- a 67-63 tally in favor of the endorsement.\par \par \uc2 Last week, after the harassment allegations against Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  surfaced, the group voted a second time and chose to rescind its endorsement. "Given the narrow margin of the original vote, it's not shocking that the despicable and disturbing comments made by \uc2 Trump\uc2  convinced some members to change their mind," Mr. LaBrie said.\par \par \uc2 He said those he knows who continue to support Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  do so more out of "a general dislike of \uc2 Clinton\uc2 ."\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=wjco20161019000096"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document J000000020161019ecaj0002f\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw272\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4080\pichgoal600

\par\par \b \uc2 Election\uc2  2016: Final Showdown Before Millions\b0\par\par\uc2 By Michael C. Bender and Laura Meckler   \par \uc2 534 \uc2 words\par \uc2 19 October 2016\par \uc2 The Wall Street Journal\par \uc2 J\par A4\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 The third and final presidential debate Wednesday presents \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  with a last chance to address tens of millions of voters and recast a race in which polls show his rival, \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , pulling away.\par \par \uc2 It isn't an easy task, political scientists say, because debates rarely provide a singular, game-changing moment. Instead, members of both parties expect another slugfest when the two widely disliked nominees meet in Las Vegas.\par \par \uc2 Democrats want Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  to articulate a positive vision for the country at a time when the \uc2 election\uc2  has revolved around accusations of sexual misconduct and dishonesty.\par \par \uc2 "This is her last big opportunity to be in front of a big national audience and make her case," \uc2 Clinton\uc2  spokeswoman Jennifer Palmieri told reporters Tuesday. She said undecided voters want to hear about issues.\par \par \uc2 Republicans, meanwhile, say Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  needs to focus on his popular antiestablishment message and shift attention away from controversies over his treatment of women and rifts with fellow Republicans.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  has tried to introduce new messages into his campaign in recent days, but it has been a faltering effort. He promoted term limits on members of Congress and temporary lobbying bans on legislative and executive-branch workers. He also called for predebate drug tests, offered dire warnings about voter fraud and attacked his party's top elected official, House Speaker \uc2 Paul Ryan\uc2 , saying Mr. Ryan may not want him to win because of the congressman's own presidential ambitions.\par \par \uc2 "For once he needs to make this a race that's not just about him," said Kevin Madden, a Republican consultant who advised the party's 2012 nominee, \uc2 Mitt Romney\uc2 . "\uc2 Clinton\uc2  wants this race to be a referendum on \uc2 Trump\uc2  and his lack of temperament, and every time she lays the bait, he never disappoints in taking it."\par \par \uc2 On the campaign trail, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  has highlighted the hacked emails of \uc2 Clinton\uc2  campaign Chairman \uc2 John Podesta\uc2 . He says the messages depict Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's close ties to Wall Street and special interests. The \uc2 Federal Bureau of Investigation\uc2  suspects Russian intelligence officials stole the emails, and Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  is likely to try to put Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  on the defensive, given his praise of Russian President \uc2 Vladimir Putin\uc2 's leadership.\par \par \uc2 On Tuesday, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  promised an "interesting" debate as his team confirmed he had invited President \uc2 Barack Obama\uc2 's Kenyan-born half-brother, Malik, who has had a strained relationship with the president. Also invited is Pat Smith, the mother of a State Department computer consultant who was killed in the 2012 Benghazi, Libya, terrorist attacks.\par \par \uc2 If there was a race-changing debate it probably was the first one, said James Stimson, a University of North Carolina political-science professor.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  had nearly closed the gap with Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  heading into the Sept. 22 event. But after his unfocused and uneven performance, Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's lead grew. She had an advantage of 2.3 percentage points before the face-off, according to a Real Clear Politics average of polls. She had a 7-point advantage Tuesday.\par \par \uc2 ---\par \par \uc2 Peter Nicholas contributed to this article.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=wjco20161019000095"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document J000000020161019ecaj0002e\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw272\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4080\pichgoal600

\par\par \b \uc2 Management: Employers Eliminate Excuse for Not Voting\b0\par\par\uc2 By Rachel Feintzeig   \par \uc2 812 \uc2 words\par \uc2 19 October 2016\par \uc2 The Wall Street Journal\par \uc2 J\par B1\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 Every so often, lawmakers propose making \uc2 Election\uc2  Day a federal holiday in hopes of nudging more voters to the polls. This year, a handful of employers are taking matters into their own hands and declaring Nov. 8 a day off work.\par \par \uc2 Payments provider Square Inc., digital media company \uc2 Thrillist Media Group\uc2  and online mattress retailer Casper Sleep Inc. are among employers giving workers the day off to vote. Leaders say the paid holiday leaves workers no excuses for not voting, even if the company loses some business.\par \par \uc2 "It's hard to get out and vote," said Neil Parikh, the co-founder of Casper, which will close its two retail stores and offices in the U.S., giving roughly 180 of its 200 global employees the day off. "Everything that you can do to make someone's life a little bit easier so they can contribute is worth it."\par \par \uc2 Mr. Parikh said Casper executives ran "back-of-the-envelope numbers" to estimate how much sales could drop without employees on hand to answer customer questions. Normally, customers can access live help via text, phone and online chat seven days a week. The company will ask some engineers and customer-service representatives to be on call on Nov. 8.\par \par \uc2 A startup that identifies itself as a tech company, New York City-based Casper considers the voting holiday a workplace perk, "a natural next step" after free meals and generous benefits, Mr. Parikh said. Tuesday elections have been a fixture of American life since the 19th century. Voting on Monday would have required residents to ride their buggies to the polls on the Sabbath, and Wednesday was out because it was typically market day, according to Betty Koed, the Senate historian.\par \par \uc2 President Obama has publicly backed the idea of holding elections on weekends or declaring \uc2 election\uc2  day a national holiday. Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders has proposed a bill that would designate \uc2 election\uc2  day as a national "Democracy Day" for voting.\par \par \uc2 Venture capitalist Hunter Walk began posting to \uc2 Twitter\uc2  this summer encouraging CEOs to remind employees to vote; the tweet drew responses from some executives who replied they planned to give employees time off to head to the polls. Mr. Walk, a \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  supporter, said that roughly 300 employers have said they are willing to make time for workers to cast their ballots. Executives who are giving employees the entire day off say the move is a nonpartisan one.\par \par \uc2 Thrillist's decision to offer a paid day off for its 230 employees sends a message about its Chief Executive \uc2 Ben Lerer\uc2 's dedication to the democratic process, said Marjorie Ajero, vice president of human resources. "The CEO takes this opportunity and being able to vote very seriously," she said.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Lerer, the son of a prominent media executive and Democratic fundraiser, plans to vote for Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , according to a company spokeswoman.\par \par \uc2 Gregg Pavone, the co-owner of Mount Pleasant, S.C.-based Limelight Custom Sign Co., gave his employees the day off to vote in 2012.\par \par \uc2 Shuttering the small business, where employees work seven days a week, is hard since he and his staff feel "always behind" on work as it is. Still, Mr. Pavone plans to do so again this year.\par \par \uc2 "It made me feel good," he said. "It made me feel like I was doing my part."\par \par \uc2 A free day off on \uc2 election\uc2  day is comparatively rare, but most companies do allot workers some time to vote. More than half of HR professionals polled by the \uc2 Society for Human Resource Management\uc2  in May said they give employees paid time off to vote, while a third said they give unpaid time off. Some do so because it is the law in many states.\par \par \uc2 Tory Burch\uc2 , the co-CEO of a retail business bearing her name, has been outspoken about employers giving workers time off to vote, writing in a Wall Street Journal opinion piece that the country's voter turnout rates are "embarrassing" and "dangerous." Ms. Burch's nearly 3,000 person firm will give its U.S. corporate employees four paid hours off, and store employees up to two paid hours off on Nov. 8.\par \par \uc2 Ms. Burch said just over half of the voting-age population turned out in 2012.\par \par \uc2 Advocates say \uc2 election\uc2 -day holidays would boost voter participation. Data, however, suggest that isn't necessarily so. In a 2009 working paper, Henry Farber, a professor of economics at Princeton University, found that state employees who had \uc2 election\uc2  day off didn't vote in greater numbers than those who still had to head to the office. "They might say, 'Gee, there might be something even better I can do that doesn't involve voting,'" said Prof. Farber of those who had the time off.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=wjco20161019000085"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document J000000020161019ecaj00024\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw272\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4080\pichgoal600

\par\par \b \uc2 Narcissism Can't Be Diagnosed Through a Camera Lens\b0\par\par\uc2 By Marc Siegel   \par \uc2 585 \uc2 words\par \uc2 19 October 2016\par \uc2 The Wall Street Journal\par \uc2 J\par A13\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 As the news media spew out fragments of medical facts on public figures, the temptation for reporters, pundits and sometimes even physicians is to draw negative conclusions and make pseudo-psychiatric diagnoses. These observations are built upon and speculated upon until all reality is lost. He is a narcissistic sociopath. She is a pathological liar. Both of them lack empathy. Such assessments are so common in this \uc2 election\uc2  season that you would think the two candidates were as familiar to you as your own uncle or aunt.\par \par \uc2 But the truth is, we don't actually know them except through the fog of the media lens. It is unfair to draw conclusions or even to make impressions about public figures we don't know, and yet we do it.\par \par \uc2 Since 1973, in the wake of damaging speculation published in a survey of psychiatrists about the mental fitness of 1964 Republican presidential candidate Sen. Barry Goldwater, the \uc2 American Psychiatric Association\uc2  has abided by a principle known as the Goldwater Rule, published in its "Principles of Medical Ethics with Annotations Especially Applicable to Psychiatry." The Goldwater Rule states that "it is unethical for a psychiatrist to offer a professional opinion unless he or she has conducted an examination and has been granted proper authorization for such a statement."\par \par \uc2 In August, as the presidential \uc2 election\uc2  campaign was heating up, the president of the American Psychiatric Association, Maria A. Oquendo, published a warning that psychiatrists resist any temptation to psychoanalyze these candidates. "Simply put," she wrote, "breaking the Goldwater Rule is irresponsible, potentially stigmatizing, and definitely unethical."\par \par \uc2 The question now is whether recent news items regarding \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  allegedly kissing and groping women years ago without their permission and \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  writing or receiving diminishing or mocking emails about groups of people somehow creates an exception to the Goldwater Rule.\par \par \uc2 I don't think it does, because we are still dealing with news items rather than with medical records or direct examination. But I would add that, as the Goldwater Rule allows, "In such circumstances, a psychiatrist may share with the public his or her expertise about psychiatric issues in general."\par \par \uc2 This profoundly unsettling and destructive \uc2 election\uc2  may still serve as a teaching tool about how we ought to behave as a society and as individuals. Evidently, we still have to learn how to treat each other with respect, regardless of race, ethnicity or gender. We need to regain the ability to accept opposing points of view instead of vilifying anyone who doesn't agree with us. Definitely no invasions of personal space without permission. No mocking of women in any way -- if nothing else, let's remember they are the people who gave birth to all of us. Also, apologies are fine, but how about no lying or making fun of each other or talking one way in public and another in private.\par \par \uc2 At the end of the second debate, after 90 minutes of vitriol, the candidates were asked to say something positive about each other. Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  praised Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's children, generally a testament to successful parenting. Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  replied that his opponent was tough, a fighter, someone who doesn't give up. He admired that, he said. These affirmative statements were steps toward a more civil political discourse.\par \par \uc2 ---\par \par \uc2 Dr. Siegel is a professor at New York University Langone Medical Center and a Fox News medical correspondent.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=wjco20161019000068"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document J000000020161019ecaj0001p\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw272\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4080\pichgoal600

\par\par \b \uc2 Politics & Ideas: The Three-Headed GOP After \uc2 Trump\b0\par\par\uc2 By William A. Galston   \par \uc2 839 \uc2 words\par \uc2 19 October 2016\par \uc2 The Wall Street Journal\par \uc2 J\par A11\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 Barring an unprecedented comeback during the final three weeks of the campaign, \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2 's insurgent bid for the presidency will fall short. It is not too early to wonder what the Republican Party will do in the wake of his defeat, its third consecutive quadrennial loss.\par \par \uc2 No Republican will ever try harder than Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  has to make working-class white voters the centerpiece of a majority coalition. His no-holds barred effort to mobilize them has offended minority voters as well as the more educated white voters who have long supported more mainstream conservative candidates. If current trends continue, he will register single-digit support among African-Americans, he will underperform \uc2 Mitt Romney\uc2 's woeful showing among Latinos, and he will lose to \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  among college-educated women.\par \par \uc2 Underlying these results are deep structural tensions. On economics, today's Republicans are -- like Caesar's Gaul -- divided into three parts. Establishment conservatives reflect the interests of corporate America. They favor free trade, immigration reform, and well-targeted public investment. They are broadly internationalist and mostly support the treaties and institutions through which the United States exercises global influence.\par \par \uc2 They believe in climate change and can live with reasonable measures to abate it. They want corporate tax reform, but not at the expense of provisions in the current code that benefit their economic sectors. They would like individual tax reform but already can use the current code to minimize their effective tax rate. They believe in "entitlement reform" but would accept revenue increases along with it -- the ever-elusive "grand bargain" at the heart of blue-ribbon commissions.\par \par \uc2 Second come the small-town, small-government conservatives who channel the anxieties and antipathies of the \uc2 National Federation of Independent Business\uc2  and whose sentiments pervade the Paul Ryan-House Republican manifesto, "A Better Way." They believe -- passionately -- that government is the principal obstacle to growth. They insist on major tax cuts, especially in the individual code through which their unincorporated businesses are taxed, and fervently reject any new taxes.\par \par \uc2 They favor reductions in domestic spending (especially welfare), structural changes in Medicare and Medicaid, and an all-out assault on the regulatory state. Compared to their corporate brethren, their outlook is more nationalist. They mostly depend on the domestic market rather than exports and frown on institutions such as the \uc2 Export-Import Bank\uc2 , which they regard as corporate welfare. They are not invited to meetings at Davos.\par \par \uc2 And lastly, we reach the populist conservatives, many of them working class, about whom so much has been written in this \uc2 election\uc2  cycle. They mistrust all large institutions, especially the federal government, but they do not have an ideological preference for smaller government. They depend on costly programs such as Social Security, Medicare, and Disability Insurance and stand to benefit from the expanded infrastructure investments that \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  and \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  have proposed.\par \par \uc2 They see large corporations as indifferent, even hostile, to their interests and concerns. They view the world outside the United States more as a threat than an opportunity. So they oppose trade agreements as well as large immigration flows and are suspicious of the obligations that alliances such as \uc2 NATO\uc2  impose on the U.S. Like Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , they regard such arrangements, on balance, as burdens rather than benefits. For them, "America First" is more than a slogan; it is a demand.\par \par \uc2 Despite the hostility between \uc2 Paul Ryan\uc2  and Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , it is just possible to see how small-government conservatives and populist conservatives might make \uc2 common cause\uc2 . The small-government advocates could make their peace with Social Security and phase in changes to Medicare slowly enough to convince the populists, many of whom are near retirement age, that they have nothing to fear. Over time, they might be able to smooth the rough edges off the ethno-nationalism that has disfigured the \uc2 Trump\uc2  campaign and repelled so many Americans. Issues such as trade and immigration would remain points of contention, but focusing on border security and tougher enforcement of existing trade agreements could make the tensions manageable.\par \par \uc2 It is harder to see how establishment conservatives can find a place within this coalition. Their policy agenda contradicts the demands of the populists, and their outlooks are antithetical. They know that their long-term success depends on the kinds of public investments that small government conservatives shun -- and the economic internationalism that populists abhor. Having abandoned the bipartisanship they espoused after World War II and casting their lot with the Republican Party, they find their influence shrinking among the kinds of conservatives who have come to dominate the GOP.\par \par \uc2 As working-class white voters left the Democrats after the 1960s, Republicans won them over with appeals to cultural traditionalism and American exceptionalism. It was a low-cost acquisition. Now, with the hollowing-out of the manufacturing sector on which working class communities depended, the bill -- a balloon payment -- has come due.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=wjco20161019000059"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document J000000020161019ecaj0001g\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw272\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4080\pichgoal600

Nearly two-thirds of respondents said that Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  would be better than \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  for the global biotech industry. Meanwhile, 10% preferred Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , while the remainder said the vote doesn't make a difference.\par \par \uc2 Those results may come as a surprise. Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  for more than a year has promised to crack down on "unjustified" price increases, and biotech shares have fallen as the Democratic candidate's lead has widened.\par \par \uc2 Of course, choosing one candidate over the other can be a relative endorsement. "While not a huge fan of Hillary either, she is the only candidate that seems to be able to string coherent thoughts together," wrote one respondent to the survey.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=wjco20161019000013"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document J000000020161019ecaj00006\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw272\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4080\pichgoal600

\par\par \b \uc2 Where \uc2 Clinton\uc2  Will Take ObamaCare\b0\par\par\uc2 By Phil Gramm   \par \uc2 1,079 \uc2 words\par \uc2 18 October 2016\par \uc2 The Wall Street Journal\par \uc2 J\par A11\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 In claiming earlier this year that the current U.S. health-care system "was HillaryCare before it was called ObamaCare," Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  was telling the truth -- but not the whole truth. In 1993, while first lady, Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  led a task force to deliver universal health care to the voters who elected her husband. She failed. After many revisions, the final bill stalled in the Senate for lack of Democratic votes.\par \par \uc2 HillaryCare was a comprehensive plan for the government to take over the health-care system, with program details and cost-control measures precisely defined. Having learned from that defeat, the Obama administration left as many details as possible to be written during implementation after ObamaCare became law. With few details to defend and the clear falsehood that "if you like your health-care plan you can keep it," President Obama pushed through his "signature" legislation.\par \par \uc2 While \uc2 Bill \uc2 Clinton\uc2  recently denounced the Affordable Care Act's effect on the health-care market as "the craziest thing in the world," ObamaCare was never anything more than a politically achievable steppingstone. As with HillaryCare, a single payer, national health-care system has always been the goal.\par \par \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's Health Security Act of 1993 would have broken the nation's health-care system into regional Healthcare Purchasing Cooperatives, which would have collectively set treatment guidelines and implemented cost-control measures. In the abstract, HillaryCare was just as popular as ObamaCare would be 16 years later, with some 20 Republican senators initially supporting an alternative plan that would have largely implemented HillaryCare.\par \par \uc2 That's when \uc2 Sen. John McCain\uc2 , the late \uc2 Sen. Paul Coverdell\uc2  and I took our fight against the bill to regional media markets. When we attacked HillaryCare as inefficient, people yawned. When we showed that the program was unaffordable, people checked their watches. But when we focused on the extraordinary loss of freedom that HillaryCare entailed, where the federal government decided the doctor you could see and the services that could be provided, our rear-guard action became a crusade.\par \par \uc2 The stone that slew the HillaryCare Goliath was freedom. Even the Democrat-appointed head of the \uc2 Congressional Budget Office\uc2  was forced to conclude that under HillaryCare health-insurance premiums were federal revenues and all health-cooperative expenditures were federal outlays.\par \par \uc2 The decisions of HillaryCare's National Control Board, which would have determined every allowable benefit and treatment, would have been final -- not reviewable by any agency or judge. What finally broke the back of HillaryCare was the provision imposing civil penalties for providing treatments not allowed by the regional cooperative and criminal penalties for accepting a separate payment for providing such care within a cooperative.\par \par \uc2 Families were forced to pay into the regional cooperatives and medical providers had to provide all medical care through the cooperatives or operate completely outside them. Since few families could afford to pay the cooperative for health care and then pay for additional care, and few providers could afford to operate totally outside the system, any real health-care choice would have been extremely limited, very expensive and available only to the highest-income families. When challenged to defend the loss of freedom HillaryCare entailed, congressional support collapsed and no effort to resurrect it was made until ObamaCare.\par \par \uc2 President Obama left out the politically dangerous details of how the program would be structured and how costs would be controlled. But in the end ObamaCare passed because he neutralized the freedom issue that had killed HillaryCare by lying about the ability of Americans to keep their health insurance. Seldom in any free society has a purposeful lie led to a greater loss of freedom.\par \par \uc2 In 2008, candidate Obama attacked HillaryCare repeatedly, claiming in a speech in Ohio that Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's approach would "have the government force you to buy health insurance, and she said that she'd consider going after your wages if you don't." But the very coercion he condemned became the cornerstone of ObamaCare, with an "individual shared responsibility payment" of up to $2,085 levied by the \uc2 IRS\uc2  on anyone without health insurance.\par \par \uc2 The Achilles' heel of ObamaCare today is the same weakness that felled HillaryCare -- the coercion required to force millions of young, healthy people into the exchanges where they can be exploited. Why the Republican majority in Congress has never forced a vote on health-care freedom, giving families the right -- promised by President Obama and his Democratic allies -- to choose not to participate in ObamaCare and to buy the health care of their choice independent of the exchanges, remains the greatest mystery of the 114th Congress.\par \par \uc2 ObamaCare's plan was always to cook the frog slowly. It didn't immediately close the individual market or shut down the small-group market as HillaryCare did. President Obama granted substantial flexibility in implementation, such as suspending penalties for individuals and employers, waiving income-verification requirements and easing the premium shock on young enrollees by administratively adjusting the community-rating system. But the result of delaying the coercion ObamaCare requires has been an explosion in health-care premiums and massive losses by insurers.\par \par \uc2 Except for the fact that it is occurring right before the elections, the four largest national health insurers dropping out of ObamaCare is not a problem. This is the plan. Eliminating the facade of private insurance is how ObamaCare "morphs" into HillaryCare and ultimately into a single-payer plan like Medicaid or Medicare. This is exactly what Mr. Obama and the Clintons wanted to begin with. Right on cue, they are now campaigning for a Bernie Sanders-type nationalized health-care system.\par \par \uc2 For the ObamaCare of today to be transformed into the HillaryCare of 1993 and finally into a nationalized health-care system, a president is needed who has the willpower to impose the coercive details, nail down hard deadlines and unleash agencies to tighten controls and squeeze the life out of private insurers. In 1993 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  unapologetically proposed to do just that. If she is elected president she will have the unilateral power under ObamaCare to do it. The loss of what remains of Americans' health-care freedom is an \uc2 election\uc2  away.\par \par \uc2 ---\par \par \uc2 Mr. Gramm, a former chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, is a visiting scholar at the \uc2 American Enterprise Institute\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 (See related letters: "Letters to the Editor: How \uc2 Clinton\uc2  Will Try to Build on ObamaCare" -- WSJ Oct. 26, 2016)\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=wjco20161018000019"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document J000000020161018ecai0000g\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 CORRECTION APPENDEDThe third presidential debate, scheduled for Wednesday, might seem like a rerun. Chris Wallace, the moderator and an anchor for Fox News, has chosen topics familiar from previous debates, including debt, immigration, foreign affairs, the economy and the Supreme Court.\par \par \uc2 Notably missing is any mention of climate change, which was also almost ignored in the earlier debates.\par \par \uc2 The fate of the planet has come up only in a single question asked by a member of the audience at the second debate, Ken Bone, who received more attention for his red sweater than for the fact that he works for a coal-fired power plant.\par \par \uc2 Michael D. McCurry, a chairman of the \uc2 Commission on Presidential Debates\uc2 , said that the moderator and the candidates, not the commission, set the content. \uc2 Irena Briganti\uc2 , a spokeswoman for Fox News, referred questions back to the commission. Neither of the presidential campaigns responded to requests for comment.\par \par \uc2 This lack of attention might lead some observers to conclude that Americans are unconcerned about climate change, but some surveys tell another story. Most Americans say they are interested in climate change, but they just do not hear much about it.\par \par \uc2 In some ways, this presidential \uc2 election\uc2  cycle has brought climate change closer to the forefront than any previous \uc2 election\uc2 , and the two campaigns could not provide a more stark contrast.\par \par \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  has a published on her website a detailed plan for dealing with climate and energy issues, and the topic was given prominence at the Democratic National Convention, which included a short film by the director James Cameron. Last week, former vice president and climate crusader Al Gore joined Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  for a rally in Miami, where they spoke of a warming planet and its possible effect on storms like Hurricane Matthew, which had just scraped the Florida coast on its way to cause devastating flooding in North Carolina. ''I can't wait to have Al Gore advising me when I am the president,'' she told the cheering crowd.\par \par \uc2 But some of her positions, particularly her acceptance of natural gas as a ''bridge'' fuel from coal-burning power plants to renewable energy, are troubling to some in the environmental movement. Many ardent environmentalists argue that all fossil fuel extraction and use must end, a contingent that would love to ban fracking, and whose philosophy is expressed in the \uc2 Twitter\uc2  hashtag #KeepItInTheGround.\par \par \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , going further than any previous presidential nominee, has said that climate change is a hoax, and has pledged to undo the Obama administration's climate initiatives, including the Paris climate agreement and the administration's Clean Power Plan, which would require power plants to clean up their emissions. Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  has also vowed to expand fossil-fuel exploration.\par \par \uc2 Yet the topic still seems oddly distant, and not just because scandal and calumny have overshadowed so many other issues. Despite the passion of activists and the issue's undeniable importance -- President Obama has said that ''no challenge poses a greater threat to future generations than climate change'' -- no broad public fervor for the topic has emerged.\par \par \uc2 According to a survey from the Yale Program on Climate Communication, 61 percent of Americans say that climate change is at least somewhat important to them personally. Yet the Yale study also found that more than half of those who say they are interested in global warming or think it's important ''rarely'' or ''never'' talk about the issue with family and friends.\par \par \uc2 In a different study, the Yale group found that just a third of Americans called protecting the environment and developing clean energy very or extremely important in their vote.\par \par \uc2 Among registered voters, party affiliation seems to determine how much they care about climate change. According to a report from the \uc2 Pew Research Center\uc2 , 56 percent of registered voters who support Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  say they care about climate change a great deal. Among those who support Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , only 15 percent say the same.\par \par \uc2 Anthony Leiserowitz, a research scientist at the Yale School of Forestry and Environmental Studies and the director of the climate change communication program there, referred to the lack of attention to the issue as an example of ''the spiral of silence,'' a term borrowed from Elisabeth Noelle-Neuman, a German political scientist.\par \par \uc2 ''When nobody talks about the issue, the clear signal is that this isn't very important,'' Dr. Leiserowitz said. ''Ultimately, it comes down to one of the most precious resources on the planet, human attention.''\par \par \uc2 He also said that when public figures such as President Obama, Pope Francis and Leonardo DiCaprio talked about climate change, it could influence how much the public says they care about climate change, how often they search on \uc2 Google\uc2  about the topic or post on social media.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Obama's focus on the issue, Dr. Leiserowitz said, is ''part of the reason why global warming is No. 6 on the priority list among liberal Democrats and it wasn't there before.''\par \par \uc2 This problem may be illustrated through the online activities of the \uc2 Clinton\uc2  campaign, which has published 654 posts on \uc2 Facebook\uc2  since Aug. 1. Just five of those posts focused on climate change, and those have not generated a great deal of user engagement. According to an analysis by The \uc2 New York Times\uc2 , only one of the 100 posts that were most liked, shared and commented on mentions climate change: It offered a link to video of the appearance with Mr. Gore.\par \par \uc2 Jeff Nesbit, who worked in the White House in 1991-92 under President George Bush and now works with the climate communications organization Climate Nexus, said that debate moderators might be reluctant to bring up climate change. He explained that could be partly because the candidates' positions are already so well known, but also because so many Americans have already come to understand that climate change is real, and so ''it sounds as if they are siding with Democrats simply by asking the question, because there's such an imbalance in the political world on the question.''\par \par \uc2 Sam Adams, the director of the United States climate initiative for the World Resources Institute, noted that while climate change was a strong part of Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's platform, it still posed a political danger. The liberal wing of her party finds her too incremental in her attitude toward ending fossil fuel dependence, and more conservative Democrats argue that a too-rapid shift to renewables will hurt coal and oil workers.\par \par \uc2 ''It's not a risk-free issue for \uc2 Clinton\uc2  to campaign on, either from the left flank or the right flank,'' he said.\par \par \uc2 And sometimes, the question simply falls through the cracks.\par \par \uc2 Lester Holt, the \uc2 NBC\uc2  anchor who moderated the first debate, did plan to ask about climate change, according to Mark Kornblau, a senior vice president for communications for NBC News and MSNBC. He dropped it, Mr. Kornblau said, because ''the early part of the debate ran longer than we had hoped, because there were more interruptions and soliloquies than we expected.''\par \par \uc2 Like the Science Times page on \uc2 Facebook\uc2 . | Sign up for the Science Times newsletter.\par \par \uc2 Correction: October 19, 2016, Wednesday\par \par \uc2 This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article on Tuesday about the lack of discussion of climate change during presidential debates misstated part of the name of a school at \uc2 Yale University\uc2 . It is the Yale School of Forestry and Environmental Studies (not Sciences).\par \par \uc2 Former Vice President Al Gore with Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  last Tuesday at a rally in Miami, where climate change was a major topic.

\par\par \uc2 BITS\par \uc2 Business/Financial Desk; SECT\par \b \uc2 Daily Report: Reluctantly, Tech Notices the \uc2 Election\b0\par\par\uc2 By QUENTIN HARDY \par \uc2 523 \uc2 words\par \uc2 18 October 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 The New York Times on the Web\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Silicon Valley believes in the future. It invents it, it invests in it. Just not so much when the future is a few weeks away.\par \par \uc2 As David Streitfeld writes, that is starting to change. Most of the world capital of technology has in the last few weeks started paying some lip service to the presidential \uc2 election\uc2 . Donations have been picking up, but, relative to the vast wealth in the Valley, remain modest.\par \par \uc2 Much of what action there has been has favored \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  -- or at least, been against \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2 . Not universally, however: As Mr. Streitfeld wrote, \uc2 Peter Thiel\uc2 , a co-founder of both \uc2 PayPal\uc2  and Palantir and early investor in \uc2 Facebook\uc2 , is giving Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's campaign $1.25 million.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Thiel, a gay, self-made billionaire immigrant libertarian, also spoke at the Republican convention in July. While much of this would seem at odds with Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's usual supporters, Mr. Thiel has also said his secret to success is believing something very few people believe is true.\par \par \uc2 In this case, he would be doubly at odds with the Valley, where some are backing Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  and most are markedly silent. It is notable that the vocal minority are, like Mr. Thiel, wealthy investors and venture capitalists. Tech corporations seem remarkably wary of offending somebody by having a political opinion, even compared with other American companies.\par \par \uc2 Part of that may be a general alienation of tech from government. Tech ignores the reality that Silicon Valley was largely built on military contracts, and favors a future where government plays an ever-smaller role.\par \par \uc2 The difficulty may be one of orientation. Tech is aimed largely at people and companies of means, who are interested in gaining more power and autonomy. Many of government's obligations are to the poor, the elderly and children. In other words, people with little power.\par \par \uc2 President Obama, speaking Thursday at a White House Technology conference in Pittsburgh, identified the problem. One part of his speech, starting at the 1:09:20 mark in the video, is worth quoting at length.\par \par \uc2 ''Government will never run the way Silicon Valley runs because, by definition, democracy is messy,'' he said. ''Part of government's job, by the way, is dealing with problems that nobody else wants to deal with.\par \par \uc2 ''So sometimes I talk to C.E.O.s, they come in and start telling me about leadership, and here's how we do things. And I say, well, if all I was doing was making a widget or producing an app, and I didn't have to worry about whether poor people could afford the widget, or I didn't have to worry about whether the app had some unintended consequences -- setting aside my Syria and Yemen portfolio -- then I think those suggestions are terrific.''\par \par \uc2 That's not the way people think about things in Silicon Valley, where an investment is supposed to remake the world, returning the money ten- or a hundredfold. It's not about maybe getting a few more votes, with an uncertain return.\par \par \uc2 Document NYTF000020161018ecai000dz\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 National Desk; SECTA\par \b \uc2 Protest of \uc2 Trump\uc2  Hits Sensitive Spot: His Brand\b0\par\par\uc2 By MICHAEL BARBARO \par \uc2 1,582 \uc2 words\par \uc2 18 October 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 1\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Morrie Gold is not a placard-waving political protester. He is a 69-year-old retired doctor in Pennsylvania.\par \par \uc2 But he recently participated in a quiet act of rebellion: He and 11 golfing buddies canceled their annual trip to a Florida resort owned by \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2  to express their disgust with his remarks about women, immigrants and minorities.\par \par \uc2 ''For me,'' Mr. Gold said, ''it's an ethical statement.''\par \par \uc2 Political demonstrations are alien to Margaret Riordan, too. ''I'm just an old white lady from Illinois,'' she said. But when friends invited the 60-year-old and her husband to dinner inside Chicago's \uc2 Trump\uc2  International Hotel and Tower, a one-woman boycott was born.\par \par \uc2 ''Pick another place,'' Ms. Riordan firmly told her friends. ''By crossing that threshold, I'm saying \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2 's O.K. I won't do that.''\par \par \uc2 The reservation was canceled.\par \par \uc2 Across the country, voters alarmed by the tenor of Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's campaign and the emerging accounts of his personal conduct are engaging in spontaneous, unorganized and inconspicuous acts of protest that take direct aim at perhaps his most prized possession: his brand name.\par \par \uc2 In more than two dozen interviews, they described creative methods of punishing his economic empire and expunging the once-esteemed reminders of him from their lives, closets, golf bags and bookshelves over the past few months. They have thrown out -- or cut up -- \uc2 Trump\uc2  neckties, called off stays at \uc2 Trump\uc2  hotels, even stopped imbibing \uc2 Trump\uc2  wines.\par \par \uc2 Gary Berry, a military veteran and Gold Star father whose son died while serving in the Army, used to love Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's sparkling wines. He bought the ornate bottles, stamped with the candidate's heavily serifed surname, near his hometown, Charlottesville, Va., for special occasions like the birth of a grandchild and wedding anniversaries.\par \par \uc2 That stopped the moment Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  mocked the parents of Humayun Khan, an Army captain who was killed in Iraq.\par \par \uc2 ''I am sorry, that's just not what you do,'' Mr. Berry said from inside a \uc2 Veterans of Foreign Wars\uc2  hall, where he was chatting with fellow veterans. ''\uc2 Trump\uc2  is despicable in my mind. I'm not buying \uc2 Trump\uc2  anymore.''\par \par \uc2 Organized, noisy demonstrations are a fixture of \uc2 election\uc2  seasons, and they have bedeviled both Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  and \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  throughout the presidential campaign. But the scattered retail rebukes of Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  are something new: independent acts of protest by everyday consumers who feel that voting against Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  would not be a sufficient reproach.\par \par \uc2 They are animated, they said, not just by his inflammatory statements or allegations of predatory behavior toward women -- which he has denied -- but by the belief that the wealth that powers his candidacy was in many ways amassed on their backs, one best-selling book, dress shirt or hotel stay at a time.\par \par \uc2 ''There's never been a presidential candidate that's had a product that I had bought before,'' said Nadav Ullman, 26, an entrepreneur who has a standing coffee meeting with his business partner in the food court of \uc2 Trump\uc2  Tower in Midtown Manhattan.\par \par \uc2 Or at least he used to. As Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  marched toward the Republican nomination, Mr. Ullman was startled by what he saw as Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's strategy of ''bigotry and racism.'' He moved his weekly meeting outside to a bench in Central Park, grabbing coffee from a Wafels & Dinges vendor on the sidewalk.\par \par \uc2 ''It kind of came down to the idea that going to \uc2 Trump\uc2  Tower -- in a very small way, no doubt, but in some capacity -- would support him,'' Mr. Ullman said.\par \par \uc2 Besides, he added, the coffee at \uc2 Trump\uc2  Tower was never very good. ''It was a win on multiple levels,'' he said.\par \par \uc2 It is difficult to measure the economic impact of such protests on Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's far-flung businesses. His holdings are privately controlled, and he has a well-documented history of exaggerating his financial performance. Amanda Miller, the vice president of marketing for the \uc2 Trump\uc2  Organization\uc2 , said in a statement on Sunday that the \uc2 Trump\uc2  brand ''remains incredibly strong, and we are seeing tremendous success across business units.''\par \par \uc2 The nonstop exposure provided by the presidential campaign has its upsides: Sales at Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's winery in Charlottesville are up 55 percent, said Kerry Woolard, its general manager. A few customers have headed there straight from his political rallies, she said.\par \par \uc2 But there are signs of a strain: An online travel company, Hipmunk, has found that bookings for \uc2 Trump\uc2  hotels on its site fell 58 percent during the first half of 2016, compared with the same period a year ago. Eric Danziger, the chief executive of \uc2 Trump\uc2  Hotels\uc2 , said that data from sites like Hipmunk ''does not provide an accurate representation of our performance.''\par \par \uc2 In interviews, though, several small-business owners said they were avoiding \uc2 Trump\uc2  hotels. Elonide Semmes, the president of a Chicago branding company, has turned her anger at Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  into company policy: Expenses incurred at \uc2 Trump\uc2  properties shall not be reimbursed. ''The one thing you can do is vote with your feet,'' she said.\par \par \uc2 Employees at Art&Motion, a New York agency that represents commercial photographers and illustrators, have done the same. They used to routinely book rooms at \uc2 Trump\uc2  hotels in New York and Chicago. But in response to what they saw as Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's factual distortions and ignorance of global affairs, the firm's partners gave their travel agent a firm decree: ''Don't even think of booking us at \uc2 Trump\uc2  hotels,'' recalled Billy Diesel, a co-founder.\par \par \uc2 ''It's a small amount of money, but it's a way to make our voices heard,'' Mr. Diesel said.\par \par \uc2 The amount of money is not always small. Before they rebooked at a rival golf resort nearby, Mr. Gold and his friends had planned to spend about $18,000 on a multiday stay at Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's Doral golf resort in Miami. They had played there for about 14 years, he said, long before Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  purchased and upgraded the property in 2012. ''It's a beautiful place,'' Mr. Gold said with a sigh.\par \par \uc2 The rejection has extended to brands controlled by Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's children, whom these consumers see as aiding and abetting the candidate they increasingly revile.\par \par \uc2 A few weeks ago, \uc2 Natalie Davis\uc2 , 50, bought a navy blue sundress from an \uc2 Ivanka \uc2 Trump\uc2  line of clothing at Lord & Taylor in Midtown Manhattan. ''It fit me really nicely,'' she said.\par \par \uc2 But soon after, she heard Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  grimly and inaccurately describe the economic and social status of African-Americans: ''You're living in your poverty, your schools are no good, you have no jobs,'' he said.\par \par \uc2 Ms. Davis, who lives in New Jersey, was appalled. ''The way he talked about black people -- it's like we are not human,'' she said.\par \par \uc2 Ms. \uc2 Trump\uc2  had not uttered the offending words, but Ms. Davis had watched her speak for her father at the Republican National Convention. That was enough. ''I feel,'' Ms. Davis said, ''like she's a puppet to her dad.''\par \par \uc2 Ms. Davis marched back into Lord & Taylor, handed a cashier her perfectly fitting sundress and asked for a refund.\par \par \uc2 ''There's no way one penny of my money is going to anything with the \uc2 Trump\uc2  name on it,'' Ms. Davis said. The cashier, she said, did not seem surprised. Ms. Davis got her $120 back. Retail workers, it seems, have grown accustomed to such interactions.\par \par \uc2 Ryan Whitacre said he was simply following company policy at a Marshalls clothing store in central Ohio when he asked a woman why she was returning an \uc2 Ivanka \uc2 Trump\uc2  shirt this summer. ''She told me she didn't want to support that name,'' he recalled.\par \par \uc2 ''They want to get that name away from them as much as they can,'' Mr. Whitacre added.\par \par \uc2 The campaign spotlight is not all bad for Ms. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's brands: The pink dress she wore at the convention quickly sold out, her aides said.\par \par \uc2 For some seething voters, returning \uc2 Trump\uc2  products is no longer feasible: They sit, well worn, inside their closets and dressers.\par \par \uc2 So they are taking creative measures.\par \par \uc2 After hearing Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  rail against the loss of American manufacturing jobs to lower-paid foreign workers, Brian Betteridge, 33, a teacher outside Philadelphia, checked the label on his \uc2 Trump\uc2  Signature Collection button-down dress shirt.\par \par \uc2 ''Made in Indonesia,'' it read, according to Mr. Betteridge.\par \par \uc2 ''I tossed it right into the garbage,'' he said. ''At that point, it represented all of these things about him that I could not stand.''\par \par \uc2 The shirt had been a gift from his grandmother. ''I haven't told her,'' he said.\par \par \uc2 Find out what you need to know about the 2016 presidential race today, and get politics news updates via \uc2 Facebook\uc2 , \uc2 Twitter\uc2  and the First Draft newsletter.\par \par \uc2 Products bearing Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's name, on display at \uc2 Trump\uc2  Tower on Fifth Avenue in New York. Many voters, alarmed by the tenor of Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's campaign, have stopped buying such items.

\par\par \uc2 EDITORIAL\par \uc2 Editorial Desk; SECTA\par \b \uc2 Shameful Silence on Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's Lies\b0\par\par\uc2 By THE EDITORIAL BOARD \par \uc2 799 \uc2 words\par \uc2 18 October 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 22\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 It may be too late for the Republican Party to save itself from the rolling disaster of \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2 , but the party's top leaders still have the duty to speak out and help save the country from his reckless rhetoric. The most frightening example is Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's frenzied claim that the presidential \uc2 election\uc2  is being ''rigged'' against him -- a claim he has ramped up as his chances of winning the presidency have gone down.\par \par \uc2 Instead of disavowing this absurdity outright, Republican leaders sit by in spineless silence. Mitch McConnell, the Senate majority leader, and \uc2 Paul Ryan\uc2 , the speaker of the House, are the two most powerful Republicans in the country and should be willing to put the national interest above their own. Both know full well that there is no ''rigging,'' and yet between them they have managed one tepid response to Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's outrageous accusations: ''Our democracy relies on confidence in \uc2 election\uc2  results,'' Mr. Ryan's spokeswoman said, ''and the speaker is fully confident the states will carry out this \uc2 election\uc2  with integrity.''\par \par \uc2 This is like standing back while an arsonist pours gasoline all over your house, then expressing confidence that the fire department will get there in time.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Ryan and Mr. McConnell could hardly dishonor themselves more than they already have in this sordid \uc2 election\uc2  year, but their refusal to stand up to Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's pernicious lie may be their lowest moment yet.\par \par \uc2 Other high-profile Republicans have amplified Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's charges and further riled up his angry base. On Saturday, Senator Jeff Sessions, a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee from Alabama, told a crowd at a \uc2 Trump\uc2  rally in New Hampshire that ''they are attempting to rig this \uc2 election\uc2 .'' On Sunday, \uc2 Rudy Giuliani\uc2 , the former New York City mayor and now Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's race-baiting surrogate, told \uc2 CNN\uc2  that he would be a ''moron'' to believe that the voting in cities like Chicago and Philadelphia would be fair to Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 . ''I have found very few situations where Republicans cheat,'' Mr. Giuliani said. ''They don't control the inner cities the way Democrats do.''\par \par \uc2 So what should patriotic Republicans be telling the nation?\par \par \uc2 First, they must reject bogus claims of voter fraud, which has been shown time and again to be virtually nonexistent. That will take work, since the specter of fraud, inevitably tinged with racist overtones, has long been a rallying cry among Republicans. But never before has a major party's presidential candidate openly encouraged this attack on the legitimacy of the electoral process. Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  does it almost daily. On Monday morning, he tweeted, ''Of course there is large scale voter fraud happening on and before \uc2 Election\uc2  Day.'' His claims are never backed up by any evidence, but they're still working: Only about one-third of \uc2 Trump\uc2  supporters believe their vote will be counted accurately, in contrast with two-thirds of \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's supporters, according to a Pew Research poll.\par \par \uc2 Second, top Republicans must reject the ridiculous notion that a national \uc2 election\uc2  can be ''rigged.'' Voting is, by design, a decentralized process run by local elections officials of both major parties. With his irresponsible language, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  is calling into doubt the integrity of Republican and Democratic officials everywhere. Some have pushed back, like Jon Husted, Ohio's Republican secretary of state, who called it ''wrong and engaging in irresponsible rhetoric'' to throw around evidence-free allegations about vote-rigging. Representative \uc2 Peter King\uc2 , a Republican from New York and \uc2 Trump\uc2  supporter, said on Monday: ''Is it legally rigged? No, it's not. Whoever wins, wins.''\par \par \uc2 Trump\uc2  apologists claim that when he says the \uc2 election\uc2  is rigged, he is only referring to critical media coverage, but that's demonstrably false. Either way, some of his supporters have swallowed his lies and are threatening to act as vigilante poll watchers on \uc2 Election\uc2  Day. One \uc2 Trump\uc2  supporter in Ohio told The \uc2 Boston Globe\uc2  that he would look for ''Mexicans. Syrians. People who can't speak American'' and that he would ''go right up behind them'' and ''make them a little bit nervous.''\par \par \uc2 The integrity of the ballot box is central to American democracy and to the peaceful transfer of power. Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  may have no qualms about destroying that idea and inflicting harm on the country long after this \uc2 election\uc2  is over. How can Mr. McConnell and Mr. Ryan continue to stand by while Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  delegitimizes the system to which they have dedicated themselves?\par \par \uc2 Follow The \uc2 New York Times\uc2  Opinion section on \uc2 Facebook\uc2  and \uc2 Twitter\uc2  (@NYTOpinion), and sign up for the Opinion Today newsletter.\par \par \uc2 (PHOTOGRAPH BY DOUG MILLS/THE NEW YORK TIMES) DRAWING (DRAWING BY JANET HANSEN AND CHRISTOPHER BRAND) \par \par \uc2 Document NYTF000020161018ecai00069\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2  suggested on Monday that \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  was too ''tough'' in her language about Russia, and said that if he won the \uc2 election\uc2 , he might meet with President \uc2 Vladimir V. Putin\uc2  before being sworn in.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  made the remarks in an interview with the conservative radio host Michael Savage, who repeatedly affirmed Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's recent claims that the mainstream media was attempting to thwart him.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  told Mr. Savage that the United States' current leadership, as well as Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , was too aggressive against Mr. Putin.\par \par \uc2 ''They insult him constantly -- I mean, no wonder he can't stand Obama and \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 ,'' Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  said, calling the tensions a ''very serious problem.''\par \par \uc2 ''It is the worst situation that we've had with Russia since the end of the Cold War, by far,'' he said.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  added that ''she shouldn't be talking so tough'' about Russia, and he suggested, as he has repeatedly in recent months, that Russia could be an ally in fighting the Islamic State.\par \par \uc2 ''We have Putin, who has no respect for Obama at all -- doesn't like him, and doesn't respect him,'' Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  told Mr. Savage, calling the difficulties ''a really catastrophic situation here, I'll be honest with you.''\par \par \uc2 He added, ''If I win on Nov. 8, I could see myself meeting with Putin and meeting with Russia prior to the start of the administration.''\par \par \uc2 Democrats have often assailed Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  for his comments about Mr. Putin, whom he has characterized as a stronger leader than President Obama.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , who has declined to make his tax returns public, has denied that he has business interests in Russia.\par \par \uc2 But he has also refused to acknowledge that the United States intelligence officials have attributed the hacking of the Democratic National Committee to Russian hackers who they said must have had the approval of the Kremlin's top leaders.\par \par \uc2 But beyond the potential meeting with Mr. Putin, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  did not offer a strategy for dealing with Moscow.\par \par \uc2 Find out what you need to know about the 2016 presidential race today, and get politics news updates via \uc2 Facebook\uc2 , \uc2 Twitter\uc2  and the First Draft newsletter.\par \par \uc2 Document NYTF000020161018ecai00068\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Throughout his campaign, Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2  has displayed a particular type of hyper masculinity -- the man who is proud not to apologize and to have never changed a diaper; who views ''loser'' as the ultimate insult; who bonds with other men by objectifying women.\par \par \uc2 It's especially striking because today's schools and workplaces try to value something different: empathy, impulse control and collaboration. For three decades, jobs that require these social skills have grown much more than others, researchers have found. They say one reason that boys are more likely than girls to get in trouble in school and are less likely to graduate is that a narrow definition of masculinity can stunt their ability to develop these skills.\par \par \uc2 If there is a silver lining to Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's views on manliness, it's that it has prompted a national discussion about the ''boys will be boys'' excuse for things like bullying, boasting or appraising women in crassly sexual terms. That has offered an opportunity for parents and teachers to make clear what behavior is unacceptable. \uc2 Michelle Obama\uc2 , in an emotional speech on Thursday, asked what message Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's words and behavior sent not just to girls, but also to men and boys.\par \par \uc2 ''Like us, these men are worried about the impact this \uc2 election\uc2  is having on our boys who are looking for role models of what it means to be a man,'' she said.\par \par \uc2 Even at my son's preschool, the children's interest in Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  led to a circle-time discussion about bullying.\par \par \uc2 There is reason for concern about the men whom boys might look up to, because boys seem to be particularly sensitive -- even more than girls -- to social influences and role models, a variety of research has found.\par \par \uc2 Role models, whether parents or public figures, can help boys overcome disruptive behavior. And boys are much more responsive to this kind of attention and modeling than girls are, according to a study by Marianne Bertrand of the University of Chicago and Jessica Pan of the \uc2 National University of Singapore\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 By calling it ''locker room talk,'' Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  implied that all men act this way. But the ''boys will be boys'' excuse, for any kind of behavior, is demeaning to boys, said Michael Kimmel, a sociologist and executive director of the Center for the Study of Men and Masculinities at \uc2 Stony Brook University\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 ''I think we do ourselves a great disservice when we just shrug our shoulders in resignation and say, 'Boys will be boys,''' he said. ''We only say that when boys do bad things. That's male bashing.''\par \par \uc2 Boys are already raised with two conflicting definitions of masculinity, Mr. Kimmel said. ''If you were to ask men, Republican or Democrat or anywhere in between, what does it mean to be a good man, they'll all tell you pretty much the same thing: honor, integrity, responsibility,'' he said. ''But ask what it means to be a real man, and we're talking about never showing your feelings, never being weak, playing through pain, winning at all costs, getting rich, getting laid.''\par \par \uc2 By excusing bad behavior as a boy thing, boys get the message that they can't improve themselves.\par \par \uc2 Many educators assume that boys are hard-wired in certain ways: to be aggressive, active, competitive, impulsive and stoic. The risk of that approach is that boys are raised to think they can't be anything else. That constrains boys, and particularly harms those who don't fit the mold -- as much as it does girls who want to be active and competitive too, said David S. Cohen, a law professor studying gender and law at \uc2 Drexel University\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 ''We have evidence that if you shift the discourse around boys and give them the cultural support they need to solve problems with strategies other than aggression and to express their feelings without being mocked, they respond just like any human being,'' said Juliet A. Williams, professor of gender studies at the \uc2 University of California, Los Angeles\uc2 , who wrote a paper titled ''Girls Can Be Anything ... But Boys Will Be Boys.''\par \par \uc2 Boys can quickly learn to recognize and call out bullying, boastfulness and inappropriate sexual language, says Michael G. Thompson, a psychologist at Belmont Hill School, a boys' school near Boston, who was a co-author of ''Raising Cain: Protecting the Emotional Life of Boys.'' That's why Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's behavior can be confusing for some of them, he said: ''They think, 'He's doing stuff that if I tried in school, I'd get in trouble for.'''\par \par \uc2 The Upshot provides news, analysis and graphics about politics, policy and everyday life.

\par\par \uc2 National Desk; SECTA\par \b \uc2 Fans of Conspiracies Find a Campaign to Believe In\b0\par\par\uc2 By CAMPBELL ROBERTSON \par \uc2 1,148 \uc2 words\par \uc2 18 October 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 16\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 KENNER, La. -- ''What the government tells you is rarely the truth, and it's never the complete truth,'' proclaimed Roger Stone, the veteran political operative and longtime confidant of \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 To the approving hoots of several dozen audience members on Sunday in a conference room at the Crowne Plaza New Orleans Airport Hotel, Mr. Stone went on to contend that his candidate was no tool of the elite power brokers at the Trilateral Commission or the Bilderberg meetings -- and then he asserted paternity cover-ups within the \uc2 Clinton\uc2  family, declared that one group supporting \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  was a ''criminal-based money-laundering operation'' and promised ''devastating'' revelations among hacked emails yet to be released.\par \par \uc2 And, in a brief detour, he explained that Lyndon B. Johnson helped orchestrate the assassination of John F. Kennedy.\par \par \uc2 The last part, while hardly the focus of Mr. Stone's speech, was what had brought him, for the second year in a row, to the annual Lee Harvey Oswald Conference, a gathering of conspiracy amateurs and prolific authors that is timed around Oswald's birthday (Oct. 18). The conference is dedicated to the proposition, as the conference organizer explained in his introductory remarks, that ''Lee Harvey Oswald was a patsy and that it was a coup d'\u233\'00\'E9tat that happened and we lost our country.''\par \par \uc2 At a time when talk of having lost the country is very much in vogue, along with deep suspicions of a powerful and secretive elite, the symposium seemed remarkably of the moment.\par \par \uc2 In between the dissections of events from 53 years ago, the proceedings repeatedly came back to the current \uc2 election\uc2 . Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , the Republican nominee, who for years raised doubts about whether President Obama was born in the United States, has charged that the \uc2 election\uc2  is ''one big fix'' and has accused Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  of meeting secretly with global financial powers ''to plot the destruction of U.S. sovereignty,'' all while intelligence officials warn of covert Russian attempts to manipulate the vote.\par \par \uc2 The idea that political figures are at the whim of shadowy forces is a core principle of the conference. The notion that elections have always been rigged was echoed by at least one presenter: Sean Stone, the son of the director Oliver Stone, whose 1991 film ''JFK'' is effectively one of the conference's founding documents. There was also extensive and generally favorable discussion of claims put forward by Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  that Senator Ted Cruz's father had played a role in a conspiracy behind the Kennedy assassination.\par \par \uc2 But the Oswald conference is not easy to classify politically. If there was any ''party'' loyalty, it was with Oswald, considered an honorable patriot manipulated and impugned by conspirators, and with Kennedy, described by one attendee as among the country's great conservatives and by one speaker as a ''kind of better-looking Bernie Sanders.''\par \par \uc2 Kris Millegan, an amiable publisher of conspiracy books and the chief organizer of the conference -- and a self-described ''Bernie man'' -- said the politics here flouted the usual labels.\par \par \uc2 ''When you get people from the far left and far right, they're really kind of saying the same things,'' he said.\par \par \uc2 Still, he acknowledged, some of the things they are saying have been embraced by the \uc2 Trump\uc2  campaign. Trust in the government began falling shortly after the assassination, surveys show, and has never been as high since. Although trust in the mass media was high in the mid-1970s, it recently reached its lowest point in decades.\par \par \uc2 A sense that some vital national essence was lost on Nov. 22, 1963, was alluded to again and again at the conference. There was also a conviction that the forces that had taken it away were still in control.\par \par \uc2 ''If they did that to us 50-some-odd years ago, what are they doing today?'' asked the Rev. Hy McEnery, 65, a New Orleans chaplain and a committed \uc2 Trump\uc2  supporter who also had questions about whether the \uc2 BP\uc2  oil spill had been planned.\par \par \uc2 In the beer garden of a biker bar on Saturday night, a celebration of Oswald's birthday included a cake, a ''Happy Birthday'' singalong and live music performed by Saint John Hunt, a son of E. Howard Hunt, one of the Richard M. Nixon operatives implicated in the Watergate break-in.\par \par \uc2 Sitting at a picnic table, George Noory considered the political landscape. A star guest at the conference, Mr. Noory hosts a popular wee-hours radio show, ''Coast to Coast AM,'' on which government-funded dark sorcery and attempts by the military to hide evidence of an ancient race of giants are considered alongside stories that may have once seemed wildly improbable but come straight from the nightly news. Mr. Noory had on a guest last week to discuss Russia's suspected role in the hacking of the \uc2 Democratic National Committee\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 ''What we've been talking about for 14 years plus, about conspiracies, about the unknown, it's proven us to be right,'' Mr. Noory said. ''These things are real, and they are happening.''\par \par \uc2 To some at the conference, there was little to do about this but despair. The books on sale depicted forces aligned against the truth on an almost incomprehensible scale, arguing that the public was being duped about the Kennedy assassination, Watergate, the Sept. 11 attacks, the origin of H.I.V. and AIDS, the Nuremberg trials, the Federal Reserve, vaccinations, U.F.O.s and countless other matters. The idea that a vote for any candidate would make a difference, several said wearily, just seemed na\u239\'00\'EFve.\par \par \uc2 But Mr. Stone's brash confidence convinced others that this \uc2 election\uc2  was a chance to fight back -- and when internet connectivity in the conference room suddenly dropped out during Mr. Stone's speech, they saw it as a sign that someone saw Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  as a threat who had to be suppressed.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Stone finished his remarks to a somewhat divided audience -- some members muttering their disagreement and others roaring with approval -- and then began signing copies of his book on the secrets of the Bush family.\par \par \uc2 A man approached and raised the topic of Justice Antonin Scalia's death in February. It seemed terribly convenient, the man suggested, leaving the Supreme Court at a 4-to-4 ideological stalemate before a potentially close \uc2 election\uc2 , and he asked Mr. Stone if he thought the death might have been orchestrated.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Stone responded with uncharacteristic discretion. ''I do,'' he said. ''But that's just my opinion.''\par \par \uc2 Judyth Vary Baker cut a birthday cake Saturday during the Lee Harvey Oswald Conference near New Orleans. Ms. Baker says she was Oswald's girlfriend. Roger Stone, center at left, a confidant of Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , told attendees to distrust the government.

\par\par \uc2 National Desk; SECTA\par \b \uc2 Melania \uc2 Trump\uc2  Rejects Women's Claims That Her Husband Groped Them\b0\par\par\uc2 By MAGGIE HABERMAN and ASHLEY PARKER \par \uc2 1,036 \uc2 words\par \uc2 18 October 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 12\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Melania \uc2 Trump\uc2 , who has been all but invisible as her husband confronts a campaign crisis over allegations that he sexually assaulted women, emerged on Monday to forcefully defend him and question the honesty of the women making the accusations.\par \par \uc2 Ms. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , in an extensive interview with \uc2 CNN\uc2 's Anderson Cooper, said the women who had accused \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2  of groping and kissing them were lying, and likened her husband to a teenage boy who engages in macho boasting.\par \par \uc2 She echoed her husband's complaint that he was the victim of a broad conspiracy between the news media and the \uc2 Clinton\uc2  campaign.\par \par \uc2 ''I believe my husband, I believe my husband -- it was all organized from the opposition,'' Ms. \uc2 Trump\uc2  said. ''They can never check the background of these women. They don't have any facts.''\par \par \uc2 Her appearance comes as Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  and his aides grapple with the worst stretch of the campaign so far, after the airing 10 days ago of an ''Access Hollywood'' recording from 2005 that captured Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  bragging to the host Billy Bush that he kisses women without invitation and that he can grab women's genitals because he is a ''star.''\par \par \uc2 Ms. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , 46, called the exchange between Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  and Mr. Bush ''boy talk,'' and said Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  had been ''egged on'' by the host ''to say dirty and bad stuff.''\par \par \uc2 But she stressed that she believed that Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  was simply being boastful and did not engage in the behavior he described.\par \par \uc2 ''Sometimes I say I have two boys at home: I have my young son, and I have my husband,'' she said with a slight laugh. ''But I know how some men talk, and that's how I saw it, yes.''\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's aides have been eager for his wife to make a public show of support for him, especially after the ''Access Hollywood'' recording dominated several media cycles and drove some Republican elected officials to abandon his candidacy.\par \par \uc2 A week ago, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's adult children, along with aides to his campaign, urged Ms. \uc2 Trump\uc2  to agree to a sit-down interview with her husband, an echo of the ''60 Minutes'' interview that Bill and \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  did in 1992 after sexual infidelity allegations arose against Mr. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 . That appearance helped stabilize Mr. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's presidential campaign.\par \par \uc2 But Ms. \uc2 Trump\uc2  had little interest in it, and the idea died.\par \par \uc2 Ms. \uc2 Trump\uc2  has never enjoyed the political stage, and was stung by media coverage in July, when it was revealed that her anticipated Republican National Convention speech borrowed lines from \uc2 Michelle Obama\uc2 's 2008 address to the Democratic National Convention. She has been absent from the campaign trail since, save for brief appearances at the first two general \uc2 election\uc2  debates, and has been spending time with the couple's young son, Barron.\par \par \uc2 She put out a written statement of support for her husband after the tape surfaced. But with Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's favorability among women perilously low, his advisers wanted Ms. \uc2 Trump\uc2  to do more.\par \par \uc2 Seated in the family's penthouse atop \uc2 Trump\uc2  Tower, Ms. \uc2 Trump\uc2  seemed occasionally ill at ease but determined to convey several points: that her husband is a gentleman, that the media is out to get him and that she is staying strong despite the ugliness. She showed an ability to remain on message that her husband sometimes lacks.\par \par \uc2 ''I watched TV hour after hour bashing him,'' Ms. \uc2 Trump\uc2  said of the television coverage the weekend the 11-year-old recording was first revealed.\par \par \uc2 She said her husband was defending himself against the accusations because ''they're lies.''\par \par \uc2 She also said her husband was approached by many women who were sexually forward with him.\par \par \uc2 ''I see many, many women coming to him and giving the phone numbers and, you know, want to work for him or inappropriate stuff from women,'' she said. ''And they know he's married.''\par \par \uc2 Ms. \uc2 Trump\uc2  steadily answered most of Mr. Cooper's polite but probing questions, though she suggested that some information she would keep private, including the details of the conversation the couple had after the tape came out.\par \par \uc2 She also taped an interview for ''Fox and Friends'' that will appear Tuesday morning.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  has vehemently denied the claims of his accusers, calling them elements of a conspiracy led partly by news media outlets, particularly \uc2 CNN\uc2  and The \uc2 New York Times\uc2 . Yet despite Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's criticism of \uc2 CNN\uc2  and its reporting, and even as some of his supporters at a rally on Monday used an anti-CNN chant, Ms. \uc2 Trump\uc2  still selected Mr. Cooper to interview her.\par \par \uc2 Asked on Fox whether it was fair for her husband to bring up Mr. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's past, Ms. \uc2 Trump\uc2  said, ''Well, if they bring up my past, why not?'' She was alluding to a television ad run during the Republican Party's nominating fight that featured a nude photo spread from Ms. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's days as a model.\par \par \uc2 Speaking to Mr. Cooper, Ms. \uc2 Trump\uc2  repeatedly denounced what she saw as the meanness and inaccuracy of media accounts about her, and she said she would like to work to protect children from the toxic dangers of negativity and anger on social media.\par \par \uc2 She has withdrawn from her own social media accounts, Ms. \uc2 Trump\uc2  said, rarely posting during the campaign. ''I see the negativity, and it's not healthy,'' she said.\par \par \uc2 But when asked whether she has advised the same to her husband, a frequent \uc2 Twitter\uc2  user who often attacks others on his feed, she replied, ''That's his decision. He's an adult.''\par \par \uc2 ''I give him many advices, but sometimes he listens, sometimes he doesn't, and he will do what he wants to do at the end, and I will do what I want to do,'' she said.\par \par \uc2 Find out what you need to know about the 2016 presidential race today, and get politics news updates via \uc2 Facebook\uc2 , \uc2 Twitter\uc2  and the First Draft newsletter.\par \par \uc2 Melania \uc2 Trump\uc2 , Ivanka \uc2 Trump\uc2 , Eric \uc2 Trump\uc2  and Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  Jr. at the debate on Oct. 9.

\par\par \uc2 National Desk; SECTA\par \b \uc2 Clinton\uc2  Pushes Into Bastions of the G.O.P.\b0\par\par\uc2 By MATT FLEGENHEIMER and JONATHAN MARTIN \par \uc2 1,349 \uc2 words\par \uc2 18 October 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 1\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's campaign is planning its most ambitious push yet into traditionally right-leaning states, a new offensive aimed at extending her growing advantage over \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2  while bolstering down-ballot candidates in what party leaders increasingly suggest could be a sweeping victory for Democrats at every level.\par \par \uc2 Signaling extraordinary confidence in Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's electoral position and a new determination to deliver a punishing message to Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  and Republicans about his racially tinged campaign, her aides said Monday that she would aggressively compete in Arizona, a state with a growing Hispanic population that has been ground zero for the country's heated debate over immigration.\par \par \uc2 Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  is ''dramatically expanding'' her efforts in Arizona, her campaign manager, Robby Mook, told reporters on Monday. She is pouring more than $2 million into advertising and dispatching perhaps her most potent surrogate, \uc2 Michelle Obama\uc2 , for a rally in Phoenix on Thursday.\par \par \uc2 In Indiana and Missouri, Mr. Mook said, the campaign will spend a total of $1 million to drive voter turnout, despite what he acknowledged was an ''uphill battle'' for Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  in two states that could determine control of the Senate. Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  is also directing more money to a series of presidential battleground states with competitive House races.\par \par \uc2 The maneuvering speaks to the unexpected tension facing Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  as she hurtles toward what aides increasingly believe will be a decisive victory -- a pleasant problem, for certain, but one that has nonetheless scrambled the campaign's strategy weeks before \uc2 Election\uc2  Day: Should Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  maximize her own margin, aiming to flip as many red states as possible to run up an electoral landslide, or prioritize the party's congressional fortunes, redirecting funds and energy down the ballot?\par \par \uc2 Thanks to an infusion of contributions in recent weeks, and what aides describe as a war chest they had maintained in case the opportunity arose, Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  is in effect trying to do both.\par \par \uc2 The double-barreled assault illustrates her priorities three weeks before \uc2 Election\uc2  Day. She hopes to hand Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  a loss so humiliating that it jars him and Republicans, removing any doubt about the wisdom of running on a grievance-oriented platform. But she also is demonstrating to the congressional Democrats with whom she may soon be working that she is also is dedicated to expanding their ranks.\par \par \uc2 ''I think it's an act of good will, because her numbers look good and some of our races are tighter,'' said Representative Dina Titus of Nevada, one of the states receiving cash. ''But it's also an important move, because she's going to need friends to get her appointments approved, to have our help breaking through the obstruction on the other side to get legislation through.''\par \par \uc2 After nearly eight years in which Democrats on Capitol Hill grumbled about a lack of such support from President Obama, Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  has taken care to stay in frequent contact with Senator \uc2 Chuck Schumer\uc2 , her former New York colleague, about down-ballot races.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Schumer, poised to be the incoming Senate Democratic leader, and the current leader, Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, met with Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's top campaign aides in Washington last month and pressed them to offer financial support for the Senate races, according to a Democratic official briefed on the meeting. And Mr. Schumer has not been shy since about his hope that if Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  clearly appeared on her way to winning the race, she would redirect some money to congressional races.\par \par \uc2 ''This is one of many things that the \uc2 Clinton\uc2  campaign is doing to help us win a majority in the Senate,'' Mr. Schumer said through a spokesman.\par \par \uc2 While party strategists are glad to have the money that Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  is directing from the \uc2 Democratic National Committee\uc2  to voter-turnout efforts in Indiana and Missouri, they have little appetite for Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  to visit those states, where she is likely to lose, because that would make it easier for Republicans to tie Democratic Senate candidates to her.\par \par \uc2 Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  is also pouring money into two congressional districts, in Nebraska and Maine, that both apportion their own presidential electoral vote and have competitive House races. And she is sending an additional $6 million to seven presidential battleground states with hotly contested Senate and House campaigns.\par \par \uc2 Democrats are also attempting to unseat Senator \uc2 John McCain\uc2  of Arizona from the seat he was first elected to in 1986, but Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's late decision to swoop into that state is not related to his race, which few Democratic leaders believe they can win. Her incursion there is about her own campaign -- and the Democrats' desire to focus attention on the damage Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  has done to Republicans with Hispanics.\par \par \uc2 In particular, Democrats hope to make an example of Sheriff Joe Arpaio, an ardent \uc2 Trump\uc2  supporter, by defeating the Phoenix lawman, whose incendiary comments about Hispanics and aggressive tactics with immigrants have garnered attention far beyond his jurisdiction in Maricopa County.\par \par \uc2 ''If Democrats were going to win in Arizona in 2016, you'd need a Republican who turns off Republican women, who really energizes Latinos, and you'd need other races on the ground that can really drive engagement -- and we have all that,'' said Andrei Cherny, a former state Democratic chairman.\par \par \uc2 Alexis Tameron, the current state Democratic chairwoman, said Republican stumbles had allowed local Democrats to ''jump our own timeline'' for when officials expected to make the state competitive on the presidential level.\par \par \uc2 ''I give credit where credit is due,'' Ms. Tameron said. ''And I have been thanking a lot of people, including \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2 .''\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's campaign did not respond to messages seeking comment on Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's plans.\par \par \uc2 Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's team had weighed for weeks how seriously to look beyond core battlegrounds like Pennsylvania, Florida and North Carolina, another state that Republicans carried in 2012.\par \par \uc2 Eager to torment Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , and the Republicans straining to navigate his erratic bid, her team has also planned at least faint, attention-grabbing plays in other states with little history of Democratic success.\par \par \uc2 In Texas, the campaign has prepared an ad highlighting Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's endorsement from The Dallas Morning News. And Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's running mate, Tim Kaine, has begun sitting for local media interviews in Utah, where Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  has struggled to break away from Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  and an independent candidate, Evan McMullin, in recent polls. (On a conference call with reporters on Monday, Mr. Mook mentioned Mr. McMullin by name.)\par \par \uc2 The most brazen push, though, is in Arizona, where the campaign has also scheduled appearances on Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's behalf from her daughter, Chelsea, and Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Mook added that Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  may appear there herself in short order. ''We certainly hope to get her there,'' he said.\par \par \uc2 Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's aides were intrigued by both Arizona and Georgia, and they surveyed voters in each state. Arizona appeared more promising, officials said, because of its combination of Mormons, Hispanics and Native Americans and because the officials found white voters in Georgia to be more resistant to Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  has more conspicuously emphasized congressional and state races during campaign appearances, taking particular care to mention fellow Democrats on the ballot.\par \par \uc2 Some Republicans seem inclined to capitalize on the attention. A fund-raising email on Monday from Senator \uc2 Marco Rubio\uc2 , a Republican in a competitive re-\uc2 election\uc2  race in Florida, went out under the subject line ''Hillary wants me gone.''\par \par \uc2 ''\uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's campaign has SO much money on its hands,'' the message read, ''that they are now focusing on down-ballot races instead of her own campaign.''\par \par \uc2 Find out what you need to know about the 2016 presidential race today, and get politics news updates via \uc2 Facebook\uc2 , \uc2 Twitter\uc2  and the First Draft newsletter.\par \par \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  backstage at a fund-raiser in Seattle on Friday. She is directing money to states with close congressional races.

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  has become the country's most notorious tax shirker. And while his long avoidance of federal income taxes is extreme, it's also part of a larger problem.\par \par \uc2 The most affluent and powerful parts of our society have too easy a time legally avoiding taxes.\par \par \uc2 Consider corporate taxes, which ultimately tend to be paid by the well-off, because they own the most stock. The official corporate rate is 35 percent, infamously higher than in any other advanced economy. Yet there are so many loopholes that companies often pay relatively little in tax.\par \par \uc2 Many companies work hard to shroud how much they really pay, sprinkling various figures throughout their complex financial statements. But companies must report one number that provides a good glimpse. It's called cash taxes paid -- the combined amount that a company pays in federal, state, local and even foreign taxes.\par \par \uc2 I asked the analysts at S&P Global Market Intelligence to calculate this number since 2007 for this country's 500 largest public companies, and the results reveal a broken tax system. Fixing it should be an early priority for the next president. If \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  wins, it may well be.\par \par \uc2 A good case study is Amazon, which pays a rate much lower than its more traditional retail competitors. Between 2007 and last year, the company paid only 13 percent of its profits in taxes.\par \par \uc2 Remember: That's not just federal taxes. It's federal, state, local and foreign taxes.\par \par \uc2 How does Amazon get away with this? A tangle of tax breaks and loopholes, some enacted in the name of creating jobs despite meager evidence that they do. For many companies, the key move is opening offices in a low-tax country like Ireland and then claiming that much of their business flows through those offices.\par \par \uc2 Put all these tax breaks together, and you end up with our system. \uc2 AT&T\uc2  and \uc2 General Electric\uc2  each paid a combined tax rate of only 18 percent since 2007, according to the S&P data. \uc2 Coca-Cola\uc2 , Apple and \uc2 IBM\uc2  paid 17 percent, and Alphabet (\uc2 Google\uc2 's parent) is at 16 percent. \uc2 Boeing\uc2  is at 8 percent, \uc2 Facebook\uc2  at 4 percent.\par \par \uc2 And the following tax rate will sound familiar to anyone who has been watching the presidential campaign: \uc2 PG&E\uc2 , the California-based utility company, has paid zero net taxes since 2007. In fact, it has paid negative taxes, receiving tax breaks more valuable than its tax payments.\par \par \uc2 ''The tax code, on the business side and the personal side, is a rotting economic carcass,'' Senator Ron Wyden, the Oregon Democrat, told me. ''All these games are significantly eroding the American tax base.''\par \par \uc2 The inequities contribute to the great American stagnation that I described in last week's column. The billions of dollars in taxes being avoided by G.E., \uc2 Coca-Cola\uc2  and others is money that can't be used to lift living standards for ordinary families: It can't be used to reduce their taxes and can't pay for schools, medical research or clean energy.\par \par \uc2 There is another victim, too -- one easily forgotten in this populist time. Many large companies do indeed pay a lot of taxes. For one reason or another, these companies can't take advantage of loopholes and must pay a rate much closer to the official one.\par \par \uc2 Brick-and-mortar retailers, for example, aren't as politically popular as manufacturers or technology companies and haven't persuaded Congress to create a lot of special tax breaks. Retailers also can't easily pretend their business is based overseas. As a result, CVS, \uc2 Home Depot\uc2 , \uc2 Walmart\uc2  and Target have all been paying a combined tax rate of more than 30 percent, more than twice as high as Amazon's rate.\par \par \uc2 This system is cumbersome -- causing companies to devote great effort to tax avoidance -- and unfair. A better system could lift economic growth, by directing more of investors' money to truly promising companies, rather than tax-advantaged ones.\par \par \uc2 Fortunately, there are signs of hope. Overhauling the corporate tax code is a rare issue on which the two parties have some common ground. If the Democrats take the Senate, Wyden is in line to lead the Finance Committee and says its first priority will be a big bill to improve roads, bridges and public transit systems (and create jobs). The second will be a corporate-tax bill to pay for the infrastructure. Both are good ideas.\par \par \uc2 As strong as the case for change is, corporate-tax reform will still cause a nasty political fight. Companies make millions of dollars from tax avoidance. To defend the status quo, some will devise clever arguments to suggest that a new system would somehow destroy jobs or otherwise wreak havoc. They will pretend they're just looking out for the rest of us.\par \par \uc2 Don't be fooled.\par \par \uc2 You can find me on \uc2 Twitter\uc2  (@DLeonhardt) and \uc2 Facebook\uc2 . I am also writing a daily email newsletter until the \uc2 election\uc2  and invite you to subscribe.\par \par \uc2 Follow The \uc2 New York Times\uc2  Opinion section on \uc2 Facebook\uc2  and \uc2
