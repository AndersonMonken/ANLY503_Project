\par\par \b \uc2 Election\uc2  2016: \uc2 Trump\uc2 , Once a Fan, Bashes \uc2 Bloomberg\uc2  Over Comments\b0\par\par\uc2 By Josh Dawsey   \par \uc2 448 \uc2 words\par \uc2 30 July 2016\par \uc2 The Wall Street Journal\par \uc2 J\par A5\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  appeared to be a fan of former New York City Mayor \uc2 Michael Bloomberg\uc2 , praising him when the billionaire was in office as "brilliant" and a "great mayor."\par \par \uc2 But after Mr. Bloomberg delivered a scathing rebuke of the Republican presidential nominee during a speech on Wednesday at the Democratic National Convention, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  took a different approach.\par \par \uc2 "'Little' \uc2 Michael Bloomberg\uc2 , who never had the guts to run for president, knows nothing about me. His last term as Mayor was a disaster!" Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  tweeted Friday morning.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  later posted that Mr. Bloomberg, who left City Hall in December 2013 after serving 12 years as mayor, wouldn't get 10% of the vote if he ran again.\par \par \uc2 "They would run him out of town!" he wrote.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Bloomberg and Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  had been cordial over the years but never close friends, according to people who know them. In his speech Wednesday, Mr. Bloomberg questioned Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's sanity and business credentials.\par \par \uc2 "Let's elect a sane, competent person," said Mr. Bloomberg, urging voters to elect Democratic nominee \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Mr. Bloomberg, who successfully ran for mayor three times as the GOP nominee, has been unaffiliated with a political party since 2007. His convention speech was viewed as politically important because Mr. Bloomberg and Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  aren't personally close, and Mr. Bloomberg considered his own run for president.\par \par \uc2 Asked for comment on Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's tweets, Mr. Bloomberg's aides pointed to their tweets highlighting the times when Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  had praised Mr. Bloomberg.\par \par \uc2 In a video posted by \uc2 Stu Loeser\uc2 , a spokesman for Mr. Bloomberg, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  said: "I have to say you have been a great mayor," while appearing with Mr. Bloomberg in 2013. Mr. Bloomberg's aides also posted a link to a 2013 Fox News appearance during which Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  called Mr. Bloomberg "brilliant."\par \par \uc2 Hank Sheinkopf, a New York-based political consultant, said Mr. Bloomberg was an effective attack dog for the \uc2 Clinton\uc2  campaign because of his business record and reputation for being a moderate.\par \par \uc2 "If Bloomberg keeps going after him, \uc2 Trump\uc2 's best bet is to attack Bloomberg's positions on gun control as extreme," Mr. Sheinkopf said. "But it's risky going after \uc2 Mike Bloomberg\uc2  because he has a lot of money and a lot of friends."\par \par \uc2 New York Mayor \uc2 Bill de Blasio\uc2 , a Democrat, also attacked Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  at the convention, saying he was unfit to lead the country.\par \par \uc2 In an Iowa speech Thursday night, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  said Mr. de Blasio was the worst mayor in the U.S.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=wjco20160730000095"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document J000000020160730ec7u0002k\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw272\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4080\pichgoal600

\par\par \b \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , Underdog\b0\par\par\uc2 By Douglas E. Schoen   \par \uc2 1,525 \uc2 words\par \uc2 30 July 2016\par \uc2 The Wall Street Journal\par \uc2 J\par A11\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 After what even critics said was a highly effective Democratic National Convention, \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  appears to have emerged as . . . the underdog.\par \par \uc2 Conventional wisdom has long held that Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  will capture the White House in November, regardless of the challenges her candidacy faces. With three months to go, that calculus looks shaky. The 2016 \uc2 election\uc2  is trending toward \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Yes, the race has been fluid and will likely remain so. Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  might get a solid convention bounce. But even in the best-case scenario, it seems unlikely to surpass Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's own bounce -- five to six points in some polls, which is greater than President Obama's in 2008 or 2012. The Republican's boost is largely the result of Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's successful speech in Cleveland. Fifty-seven percent of those watching had a "very positive" reaction, and 56% said that they were more likely to vote for him. You'd never know it from listening to the mainstream press, which condemned the speech as "dark."\par \par \uc2 Right now the momentum points in one direction: Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's. The race is tied in the Real Clear Politics polling average, which represents a reversal in his fortunes of three to four points. Earlier this week, with the GOP convention still fresh, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  had the clear advantage and edged ahead of Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 . As polls during the first days of the Democratic convention began to be factored in, a statistical tie emerged.\par \par \uc2 It's too soon to say whether the final two days of the Philadelphia confab will change the dynamic. But there has been clear movement to Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  in the past month. Look at the CNN/ORC poll for a four-way race, including the Libertarian Party's \uc2 Gary Johnson\uc2  and the Green Party's Jill Stein. Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  has gained seven points since mid-July and now beats Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  44% to 39%, with Mr. Johnson at 9% and Ms. Stein at 3%. In a head-to-head matchup, the Republican wins 48% to 45%.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's lead is more than double that in an LA Times/USC survey released this week, which shows him winning 47% to 40%. And in the CNN/ORC poll he's up by 18 points with independents -- one reason why former New York City Mayor \uc2 Michael Bloomberg\uc2  was enlisted to deliver an impassioned speech Wednesday in Philadelphia.\par \par \uc2 Nate Silver's 538 "now-cast" -- meant to simulate what would happen if \uc2 Election\uc2  Day were today -- also shows clear movement in Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's direction. Only a month ago, Mr. Silver gave the Republican about a 20% chance of winning. That has risen to a 47% chance. Mr. Silver still gives Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  better than even odds of becoming president, but that's down significantly from a few weeks ago.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  is surging as well in swing states, where he is now slightly ahead, within the margin of error, or at least within striking distance. The Real Clear Politics polling average for Florida puts the GOP nominee up by 0.3 percentage points. In Ohio he is down by 0.8 points. And in Pennsylvania he trails by 4.4 points.\par \par \uc2 This is pretty astounding, considering that \uc2 Clinton\uc2  & Co. has spent $57 million on ads thus far -- $25 million from the campaign and $32 million from super PACs. Team \uc2 Trump\uc2  has put up only $3.6 million in ads, all from outside groups.\par \par \uc2 Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's campaign is weighed down by other factors. Her negatives have reached their highest point yet. Recent Gallup polling shows that 38% of Americans view her favorably and 57% unfavorably. That's her worst score since 1996, before she entered politics in her own right, and a far cry from the 69% approval she enjoyed in The Wall Street Journal/NBC poll when she left public office in 2013.\par \par \uc2 Americans still don't trust her. This week's CNN/ORC poll found that only 30% of voters say she is honest and trustworthy and 68% say she isn't, her worst rating in that survey. To put these dreadful numbers in perspective, consider that even Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  is beating her. Forty-three percent of voters find him honest and trustworthy, a five-point increase since the GOP convention. This despite that PolitiFact rates his statements "false" or "pants on fire" more than 50% of the time.\par \par \uc2 It's also unclear whether Bernie Sanders's supporters will come out in force for Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 . A Bloomberg poll last month found that barely half of Sanders backers said that they would support the Democratic nominee. Eighteen percent said they would go for Mr. Johnson, the Libertarian, and 22% for Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Most fundamentally, Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  must contend with the fact that about 70% of Americans say the country is headed in the wrong direction -- traditionally a fatal indicator for a party trying to hold the White House. \uc2 Bill \uc2 Clinton\uc2  benefited from this dynamic in 1992, when 76% of Americans felt this way, and that is what made him president. A poll this month from YouGov shows that, despite years of steady (if anemic) economic growth, 55% of Americans think the country is still in recession. Mr. Obama's touting of his record in an otherwise terrific speech will fall on deaf ears.\par \par \uc2 Indeed, we should view the Democrats' superficially successful convention with a more critical eye. Without question, the party made great political theater. \uc2 Bill \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , \uc2 Joe Biden\uc2 , the president and Mrs. Obama all delivered powerful speeches that, as a Democrat myself, I found effective. Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's speech, a laundry list of party talking points, was workmanlike but didn't rise to the same heights.\par \par \uc2 Yet on the substance Democrats showed themselves to be out of sync with the American mood. Except for touting the killing of Osama bin Laden five years ago, the convention included almost no mention of terrorism until the last two nights, when Democrats chanted "U.S.A." and repeatedly asserted that the American military is the strongest in the world.\par \par \uc2 The ebullient tone doesn't harmonize with more than 80% of voters who say, according to a Fox News poll last month, that Americans aren't confident in the nation's ability to prevent a terrorist attack. Democrats' reluctance to discuss Islamic State -- with the exception of \uc2 Leon Panetta\uc2 , who was booed -- is profoundly troubling. ISIS is striking Europe regularly, and fears are mounting of more attacks at home. No surprise that voters prefer Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  to Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  on fighting terrorism, 50% to 46%, according to Gallup.\par \par \uc2 The Democrats did try to close this gap by bringing 25 military officers onto the stage. Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , too, offered a sharp critique of Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's national security ideas. But she didn't mention radical Islam. It's an open question whether this last-minute pivot to national security will make a difference.\par \par \uc2 Democrats also failed to offer any specific plan to create jobs or promote economic growth. Mr. Obama says he's optimistic, but few voters share that feeling. Up to two-thirds of Americans are looking for change. For many, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  makes a powerful case. Merely calling Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  a "change maker," as her husband did, isn't going to cut it in this environment.\par \par \uc2 The Democrats seem to be coming to grips with the dangers they face, however. All the prime-time speakers in Philadelphia went negative on Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 . President Obama called him a "homegrown demagogue" and Vice President Biden added that the Republican is "clueless." After months of denying that the New York businessman had any chance to win, Mr. Obama told the "Today" show this week that "anything is possible."\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  is no sure thing, but he begins the general-\uc2 election\uc2  campaign as a slight favorite. He's still volatile, always one sentence away from a controversy. His joke this week that Russian hackers should help find Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's lost emails made more than a few people uneasy. His negatives are cripplingly high, at 70%, and he is on track to be outspent more than 3 to 1. He has yet to build an effective campaign organization and begins at a considerable disadvantage in the Electoral College. At this point, he'll probably have to depend on his rhetorical skills to win the debates, and ultimately the \uc2 election\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 That said, few believed Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  could win the Republican nomination, and few believed he would pull ahead of his Democratic opponent in the polls. He has now done both, and he has the issues and the national mood behind him.\par \par \uc2 I have worked for both Clintons -- Bill in his 1996 presidential campaign and Hillary in her 2000 Senate campaign. No one knows better than I do that they understand how to fight and will do what it takes to win. The question is whether that will be enough. \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  -- and the Democrats -- are now battling uphill.\par \par \uc2 ---\par \par \uc2 Mr. Schoen served as a political adviser and pollster for President \uc2 Bill \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , 1994-2000.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=wjco20160730000082"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document J000000020160730ec7u00027\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw272\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4080\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 Regarding your editorial "\uc2 Clinton\uc2  to Madison: Get Me Rewrite" (July 20): Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's promise to seek a constitutional amendment on day one of her presidency is on the right track -- but with the wrong case. If she promised to seek to amend the Constitution to overturn Marbury v. Madison, she may win over even a conservative libertarian-leaning voter like me.\par \par \uc2 Marbury v. Madison (1803) was an unconstitutional power grab that rewrote the separation of powers. The fact that so many controversial issues are increasingly decided by 5-4 decisions by unelected justices with lifetime appointments (and in reality by the whims of one swing justice, \uc2 Anthony Kennedy\uc2 ) is an abomination in a democratic system of government. To invalidate any statute -- whether it be abortion restrictions, flag burning or campaign financing -- of a democratically elected legislative body is such a momentous action that it should require a unanimous decision of the Supreme Court.\par \par \uc2 While Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  is offering amendments to the Constitution, how about a second one that is long overdue -- imposing 10-year terms on all federal judges so we don't have to endure the rabid partisan ramblings of a Supreme Court justice who should have retired long ago. Now that would seal my vote for Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Ann Betten\par \par \uc2 West Des Moines, Iowa\par \par \uc2 ---\par \par \uc2 Your editorial emphasizes Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's intention to strike down \uc2 Citizens United\uc2  if elected. Anyone who really wants to reduce the influence of corporations on the laws of this country would have to rein in lobbyists. The money spent by lobbyists to influence legislation dwarfs the money spent by PACs at \uc2 election\uc2  time. Lobbying money is the mother's milk of politics. It provides perks and influence after being elected and a job when leaving. No law is going to be passed to do away with such a good thing.\par \par \uc2 George Rupprecht\par \par \uc2 Tucson, Ariz.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=wjco20160730000073"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document J000000020160730ec7u0001y\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw272\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4080\pichgoal600

\par\par \b \uc2 Declarations: A Disunited Party's Successful Convention\b0\par\par\uc2 By Peggy Noonan   \par \uc2 1,272 \uc2 words\par \uc2 30 July 2016\par \uc2 The Wall Street Journal\par \uc2 J\par A13\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 The showbiz headline from the Democrats' convention in Philadelphia is that they did fine. They have their nominees; they had good speeches and glamorous celebrities; the cameras panning the audience often caught glistening faces, not angry ones. It did not look unified but it did look alive. So the impression was of relative success.\par \par \uc2 The historical headline is something different, and should not be lost in the stagecraft. It was captured in two events. The first was the moment, early Monday afternoon, when Bernie Sanders lost control of his movement. His rally audience jeered the idea of unity, refused to cheer \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , failed to boo \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  lustily. A flicker of disoriented surprise crossed Mr. Sanders's face. He was no longer riding the tiger, it was riding him.\par \par \uc2 The second was the moment when \uc2 Leon Panetta\uc2  -- former chief of staff to a Democratic president, former defense secretary and CIA director, longtime and reliable partisan -- was jeered at the convention Wednesday. "No more war!" they chanted when he spoke of terrorism. He looked mildly concussed. Get used to that expression, we're going to be seeing more of it.\par \par \uc2 The Democratic Party is turning left. It's not about "Bernie" now, and his followers are not going away. It is about the political impulses of the party's young, which is to say its future. They are part of a tide of the passionate, the ideological and the underinformed. They have no idea what socialism is or what it has done in the past to great nations, and they appear to want it. I guess we'll have to go through that argument again. They have already pushed Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  left and, should she become president, will push her further, against her wishes. But she has a new base to keep close. This shift is a real historical development.\par \par \uc2 President Obama has been an unusually strong helper and supporter of Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , and this is assumed to be linked to interest in his legacy. Successful presidents tend to be followed by presidents from their own party. But it is more than legacy, or loyalty. It is a desire to avoid humiliation. If Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  wins, voters will be saying more than that Mr. Obama's leadership didn't quite work. They'll be saying he was such a failure that they lurched desperately toward someone who'd blow the whole system up. Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's \uc2 election\uc2  would be a stinging rebuke, one for the history books. Mr. Obama will give everything he has to keep that from happening.\par \par \uc2 To the speeches.\par \par \uc2 The most electric line did not come from a politician. It came Thursday from a man named Khizr Khan, an American Muslim whose son, a U.S. Army captain, died in combat after 9/11. Mr. Khan said to Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , who did not serve in the military: "You have sacrificed nothing." The crowd roared to its feet at those four damning words.\par \par \uc2 Bluntest in his case against Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  was \uc2 Mike Bloomberg\uc2 : "I'm a New Yorker, and I know a con when I see one." He questioned Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's wealth: "Truth be told, the richest thing about \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  is his hypocrisy." An American president must understand business, Mr. Bloomberg said, but Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  doesn't -- thus his history of bankruptcies, lawsuits, bitter shareholders and aggrieved contractors. "\uc2 Trump\uc2  says he wants to run the nation like he's run his business. God help us."\par \par \uc2 Joe Biden\uc2  was good and returned the word "malarkey" to the lexicon, for which God bless him. Tim Kaine was fine. I observed in 2008 that his charm is that he seems not like the man in first class but the man in coach who may be the air marshal. He is charming, but we will see the next few months if there's something servile there.\par \par \uc2 Bill \uc2 Clinton\uc2  looked physically well. His task, as always, was to humanize his wife. It seemed to me he was trying to tell millennials some history they might not know -- that she'd been a student too once, and a young wife and mother. There was too much information. I was startled by his reference to "when her water broke." Alexandra Petri of the \uc2 Washington Post\uc2  merrily observed this was the first time a convention speaker has ever said that about a presidential nominee, "except for one very confused man who panicked in the middle of introducing Herbert Hoover."\par \par \uc2 As for Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , I didn't agree with the idea it had to be the speech of her life. It would be an important speech and would do her good if she got it right. Otherwise it was a big speech in a quarter-century of big speeches. It's not as if people don't know what they think of her.\par \par \uc2 She did herself no harm. She didn't help herself as much as she might have. The speech was workmanlike. It sounded like things she'd said before. She wore a radiant white suit and looked wonderful, relaxed and happy.\par \par \uc2 The speech was ploddingly progressive and at moments relatable.\par \par \uc2 She has a tropism toward cliches. Interestingly, unlike many politicians she knows they are cliches. She must just like them. "We must all work together so we can all rise together." "We will rise to the challenge just as we always have." "As secretary of state I went to 112 countries." "Let's go out and make it happen together!"\par \par \uc2 She spoke of compromise and common purpose. "Our Founders embraced the truth . . . that we are stronger together."\par \par \uc2 She did not do what I thought she'd do -- something new.\par \par \uc2 She came alive, and was most fully herself, when on attack. Of Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's convention speech: "He spoke for 70-odd minutes, and I do mean odd." That's the witty Hillary her friends describe. Cuttingly, on the weakest moment in his speech: "Don't believe anyone who says, 'I alone can fix it.'" He says he knows more about ISIS than the generals? "No Donald, you don't." "There is no other \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2 . This is it." He is a merchant of menace. "You have to stand up to bullies."\par \par \uc2 Shrewdly: "It's true, I sweat the details of policy." But "it's not just a detail if it's your kid."\par \par \uc2 "Some people don't know what to make of me," she said. That isn't precisely true -- many people, perhaps most, feel they do. One lovely line: "When there are no ceilings, the sky's the limit."\par \par \uc2 She finished stronger than she started.\par \par \uc2 It used to be both parties had their conventions and then rested a while, beginning the campaign proper on Labor Day weekend. Not this year. The battle continues tomorrow and will not let up until Nov.9.\par \par \uc2 The big thing we found out in the convention is exactly how Democrats will attempt to dismantle Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  piece by piece. He's not just reckless, he's ridiculous -- a fraud in business, a screwball, unserious and uninformed about policy. They'll try to drive him crazy, too, quite deliberately. They'll do this not by quoting him accurately and denouncing his views, but by misquoting him, putting a twist on what he said, and then denouncing him. They'll try to get him to whine, whinge, blow his top. They're doing it already, to their profit. They'll play the picador tormenting the bull, goading him, weakened, into an unfortunate charge.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=wjco20160730000071"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document J000000020160730ec7u0001w\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw272\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4080\pichgoal600

\par\par \b \uc2 REVIEW --- Weekend Confidential: J.D. Vance --- The author of 'Hillbilly Elegy' on his tough upbringing and the anger of the white working class\b0\par\par\uc2 By Alexandra Wolfe   \par \uc2 1,006 \uc2 words\par \uc2 30 July 2016\par \uc2 The Wall Street Journal\par \uc2 J\par C11\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 J.D. Vance didn't encounter anyone else with a personal story like his when he arrived at Yale Law School six years ago. His early family life in a poor town in eastern Ohio was tough, with a mother who became a drug addict and a partially absent father. He and his sister spent a lot of time with his grandparents, evangelical Christians who were originally from Kentucky and inspired Mr. Vance to do more with his life.\par \par \uc2 His experiences are the basis of his new memoir, "Hillbilly Elegy." The book started out as a quest to answer questions about his own upbringing but developed into a broader conversation about social divisions in the U.S. and feelings of disenfranchisement among the white working class.\par \par \uc2 Now a principal at an investment firm in San Francisco, Mr. Vance, 31, decided to start writing a memoir while he was at Yale, feeling like he was "culturally foreign." "I'm a straight, white, conservative male, and I'd never felt out of place in my entire life. But I did at this weird educational institution, and I started to ask myself why," he says. "Why is it that there aren't many people -- or any people -- from a background like mine at places like Yale?"\par \par \uc2 He describes how his mother got pregnant at 18, was divorced by 19 and remarried four times. She got angry at him one time when he was 11 and threatened to crash the car they were riding in and kill them both. (When reached for comment by The Wall Street Journal, his mother confirmed the book's account.)\par \par \uc2 In high school, he moved in with his grandmother, a caring but tough woman who once set his grandfather on fire after he came home drunk one night. Going back further in his family's history, an ancestor was locally famous for brutally killing a Union soldier during the Civil War. Family was a priority: His grandparents taught him never to start a fistfight -- unless someone insults your relatives.\par \par \uc2 He credits his grandparents, religion and his time in the Marine Corps from 2003 to 2007 for helping him to get his life together. Whereas many of the people around him growing up seemed to have a feeling of "learned helplessness" and didn't think their decisions mattered, he says, he learned the opposite in the Marines: "My decisions did matter, and I did have some control over my own life."\par \par \uc2 After the military, he went to \uc2 Ohio State University\uc2 , where he got his bachelor's degree in political science and philosophy, and then Yale. There he met the woman he would eventually marry, but at first, he says, he had no idea what a normal relationship was like.\par \par \uc2 "In the family life that I grew up in, the way you handled conflict resolution with your spouse or your partner was by screaming and yelling, and if things got really bad, maybe throwing stuff or hitting and punching them," he says. He only later realized that rather than fighting to win, he should try to solve problems in a relationship. "It sounds so obvious, but it was such a revelation to me," he says.\par \par \uc2 After law school, Mr. Vance worked at a law firm and then became an executive at a biotech company. From there, he left to join Mithril Capital, an investment firm. He and his wife, a lawyer, live in San Francisco with their two dogs.\par \par \uc2 His book, which came out a month ago, has struck a nerve. The trials of the white working class have been much discussed this \uc2 election\uc2  year: disappearing manufacturing jobs, stagnant wages, opioid addiction. Mr. Vance sees the appeal of Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  for people who have "this sense that things are kind of apocalyptically bad," he says.\par \par \uc2 He's been surprised by the book's positive reception and is grateful for it. "I think it speaks to a couple of things: first, that people are really curious about the anger and frustration of the white working class; second, that members of the white working class have been hungry to have someone tell their story," he says.\par \par \uc2 He hopes that his experiences and path upward with the help of religion, discipline and family will inspire communities to promote those values. "Concretely, I want pastors and church leaders to think about how to build community churches, to keep people engaged, and to worry less about politics and more about how the people in their communities are doing," he says. "I want parents to fight and scream less, and to recognize how destructive chaos is to their children's future."\par \par \uc2 He thinks that school leaders could help by being more cognizant of what's going on in students' home lives. But most of all, he wants people to hold themselves responsible for their own conduct and choices. "Those of us who weren't given every advantage can make better choices, and those choices do have the power to affect our lives," he says.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Vance goes back to Ohio a few times a year to see his aunt, sister and father (with whom he reconnected when he was 12), and he tries to go back to Kentucky regularly. "I don't feel at all like I can't go back home," he says. "The weird thing about my life is that I always feel a little out of place in both Ohio and among the elites, but I'm always most comfortable when I'm around my family."\par \par \uc2 In his new life, it feels "like my spaceship crash-landed in Oz," he adds. "Seriously, I love my life, but I'll always feel a little out of place among lawyers and bankers and doctors, and a part of me wishes I was back home, chasing frogs and fishing."\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=wjco20160730000024"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document J000000020160730ec7u0000n\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw272\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4080\pichgoal600

\par\par \b \uc2 Analysis: Two Conventions, Two Distinct World Views\b0\par\par\uc2 By Gerald F.

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 PHILADELPHIA -- \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  and her Democratic Party launched into the general \uc2 election\uc2  campaign Thursday night by presenting a portrait of the country that is not just different from the one \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  and the Republicans offered last week, but almost its opposite.\par \par \uc2 In the \uc2 Trump\uc2  version, a wall is necessary on the southern border. In the \uc2 Clinton\uc2  version, as presented in her convention acceptance speech, "we will not build a wall."\par \par \uc2 In the \uc2 Trump\uc2  version, illegal immigration poses a severe economic and security threat. In the \uc2 Clinton\uc2  view, immigration strengthens the country and "we'll build a path to citizenship" for millions of such immigrants already working in the U.S.\par \par \uc2 In the \uc2 Trump\uc2  version, the American military is underfunded and in decline. In the \uc2 Clinton\uc2  version, "we have the most powerful military."\par \par \uc2 In the \uc2 Trump\uc2  version, overreaction to climate change poses a threat to the economy. In the \uc2 Clinton\uc2  version, underreaction is the real threat.\par \par \uc2 In the \uc2 Trump\uc2  version, Democrats will obliterate Second Amendment gun rights. In the \uc2 Clinton\uc2  version, Democrats want "common-sense reforms."\par \par \uc2 In the \uc2 Trump\uc2  view, the American economy is weak and underperforming and working-class Americans are sliding backward. In the \uc2 Clinton\uc2  view, the economy "is so much stronger" than when President \uc2 Barack Obama\uc2  took office while the auto industry just had "its best year ever."\par \par \uc2 In short, the back-to-back convention weeks, and back-to-back acceptance speeches they contained, should eliminate any of those assertions heard in past campaigns that there is no real difference between the two parties and their leading candidates.\par \par \uc2 For Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , the convention week and the speech that brought it to a close were all designed not merely to accentuate such differences, though. They were designed to tackle four distinct missions critical to her chances for success in November: Make people like her more; make people like Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  less; unify a fractured party; and reconnect with white working-class voters.\par \par \uc2 After a long and steamy week, and her lengthy acceptance speech, she had posted a mixed record in accomplishing them.\par \par \uc2 The mission she and her party pursued with the most persistence and discipline was the effort to make people like the Republican nominee less. Among other Democrats here, two words were heard repeatedly in referring to Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 : fear and danger.\par \par \uc2 The first was used in asserting that Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  is pursuing a strategy of stoking fear and in the process sowing division among Americans. Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  described dark forces at work on the national psyche: "Powerful forces are threatening to pull us apart. Bonds of trust and respect are fraying."\par \par \uc2 The idea of danger was tied to national security. "Ask yourself: Does \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  have the temperament to be commander-in-chef?" Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  asked. Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  made that argument easier to make by declaring midweek that he would be happy if Russia had tapped into Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's emails from the State Department because that would mean the Russians could retrieve messages that had been deleted. The overall effect can't have been a good one for Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 The mission of making voters like \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  more -- or at least trust her more -- was more complex. Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  carries the blessing and the curse of having been a national political figure for a quarter of a century; views of her are fairly hardened, and hence, hard to change.\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 Clinton\uc2  challenge here was to whittle down the stunningly high share of Americans who dislike and mistrust her. The likability mission fell largely to her family: husband \uc2 Bill \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , who delivered a typically engrossing speech about the long arc of their personal relationship, and daughter Chelsea, who delivered a highly personalized introduction.\par \par \uc2 The problem with Mr. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's remarks is that they were inevitably shadowed by the strains in the marital relationship caused by the Monica Lewinsky affair.\par \par \uc2 Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  and her party tried to tackle the trust deficit with what amounted to a policy-based argument: Look at what she has done -- as children's rights crusader, senator in the post-9/11 environment and secretary of state -- and you will see that you can trust her to do what she says. "So look at my record," Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  implored, in a year when having a long record in Washington is as likely to be a liability as an asset.\par \par \uc2 The task of unifying the party -- crucial to generating enthusiasm among young voters and the party's liberal base -- ultimately went better than once seemed likely. Disaster was lurking after an exceptionally messy opening day, in which the forces of \uc2 Clinton\uc2  primary foe Bernie Sanders were in open revolt.\par \par \uc2 Then, a memorable speech by first lady \uc2 Michelle Obama\uc2  on Monday night helped calm the waters. But much of the calming was done by Sen. Sanders himself. He abandoned weeks of seeming to accept defeat only grudgingly, and finally embraced his foe unequivocally.\par \par \uc2 The mission of reaching out to white working-class voters may be the area where the convention made the fewest inroads.\par \par \uc2 For three days, the party's embrace of diversity in race, gender and sexual orientation was on full display. Finally, Thursday night, a factory worker, a home-care provider and a laid-off restaurant worker appeared on stage.\par \par \uc2 (See related letter: "Letters to the Editor: Neither Party Said Much About Our National Debt" -- WSJ August 6, 2016)\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=wjco20160729000111"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document J000000020160729ec7t0002t\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 CORRECTION APPENDEDPHILADELPHIA -- Hillary Diane Rodham \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , who sacrificed personal ambition for her husband's political career and then rose to be a globally influential figure, became the first woman to accept a major party's presidential nomination on Thursday night, a prize that generations of American women have dreamed about for one of their own.\par \par \uc2 Declaring that the nation was at ''a moment of reckoning,'' Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , 68, urged voters to reject the divisive policy ideas and combative politics of the Republican nominee, \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2 . She offered herself as a steady and patriotic American who would stand up for citizens of all races and creeds and unite the country to persevere against Islamic terrorists, economic troubles, and the chaos of gun violence.\par \par \uc2 ''Powerful forces are threatening to pull us apart, bonds of trust and respect are fraying,'' said Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , who worked on the speech until the early hours of Thursday morning. ''And just as with our founders there are no guarantees. It truly is up to us. We have to decide whether we all will work together so we all can rise together.''\par \par \uc2 Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  radiated confidence, from her pungent delivery and easy laugh to the unusually expressive ways she shifted her tone and delighted in her own best lines. She smoothly acknowledged her own limitations and trust issues as a public figure and forcefully challenged Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  over his claims that he alone could fix America's problems.\par \par \uc2 And after 25 years in a sometimes brutal national spotlight, Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  tried to explain who she is and what drives her -- from her Methodist faith to her passion for government policy that could mean all the difference for people.\par \par \uc2 ''I sweat the details of policy,'' Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  said. ''Because it's not just a detail if it's your kid -- if it's your family. It's a big deal. And it should be a big deal to your president.''\par \par \uc2 It was one of several contrasts she drew with Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , who has barely explained how he would carry out his policy goals. And she received help from several Republicans and military veterans who took the convention stage earlier in the evening to warn that Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  was not fit for the presidency and would take the United States to ''a dark place of discord and fear,'' as a retired general, \uc2 John Allen\uc2 , put it. Democrats in the convention hall broke out into a booming, lengthy chant of ''U.S.A., U.S.A.!''\par \par \uc2 But the most powerful guest speaker of the evening was Khizr Khan, a Muslim American whose son joined the Army after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks and was killed during service in Iraq. Mr. Khan, rebuking Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  for frequently demonizing Muslims as threats to the United States, pulled a copy of the Constitution out of his suit jacket.\par \par \uc2 ''Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , have you even read the Constitution?'' he said. ''You have sacrificed nothing.''\par \par \uc2 His words seemed to send a collective shiver through the convention hall, leaving some delegates in tears.\par \par \uc2 Few recent political conventions have had a night gusting with so much history and high emotion. If elected, Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  would become the 45th president of the United States, as well as the first to be married to a former president, \uc2 Bill \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , the nation's 42nd.\par \par \uc2 She would be the latest in a long line of Yale graduates and accomplished lawyers to lead the country, but she would also be the first mother and grandmother to be commander in chief, decades after women became heads of state elsewhere.\par \par \uc2 Democrats roared with passion and pride as a beaming Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  took the stage after her daughter, Chelsea, introduced her as an American who was inspired by her own mother's impoverished childhood and had faced personal and professional choices that defined generations of women. The two locked eyes and fell into a long embrace as Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  patted her back. A moment later, Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  waved at Mr. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , and he blew her a kiss.\par \par \uc2 Then Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , who has given only a few major political speeches in her life, delivered her biggest yet. She offered a positive portrait of America that felt like a different country than the nation in decline that Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  often describes and that many voters fear has come to pass after years of terrorism at home and abroad and the growing gap between rich and poor.\par \par \uc2 ''He's betting that the perils of today's world will blind us to its unlimited promise,'' Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  said. ''He wants us to fear the future and fear each other. Well, a great Democratic President, Franklin Delano Roosevelt, came up with the perfect rebuke to \uc2 Trump\uc2  more than 80 years ago, during a much more perilous time: 'The only thing we have to fear is fear itself.'''\par \par \uc2 Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , facing a three-month general \uc2 election\uc2  campaign against an unpredictable Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , who has risen in the polls since his convention speech last week, hoped that her remarks here would not only energize her party, but also help her connect with undecided and independent voters who are skeptical of her candidacy.\par \par \uc2 She nodded toward the political work she still had to do. Praising her rival for the Democratic nomination, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, she told his mostly liberal supporters -- some of whom booed or staged a ''silent protest'' in the hall, declining to applaud her speech -- ''I want you to know, I've heard you. Your cause is our cause.''\par \par \uc2 And she acknowledged that many voters still do not relate to her after her eight years as first lady, eight as a senator, and four as secretary of state.\par \par \uc2 ''The truth is, through all these years of public service, the 'service' part has always come easier to me than the 'public' part,'' Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  said. ''I get it that some people just don't know what to make of me,'' she added before sharing memories of her humble roots and life lessons from church and her mother -- particularly, ''no one gets through life alone.''\par \par \uc2 Her strategy was to go hard at Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , repeatedly drawing contrasts between her positions -- which are in the mainstream of Democratic politics -- and Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's unorthodox views for a Republican, such as placing tariffs on other nations' goods and possibly withdrawing from treaties and trade deals.\par \par \uc2 Reciting a litany of unusual and unlikely ideas that Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  laid out at the Republican convention, Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  drew huge laugh when she said, ''He spoke for 70-odd minutes -- and I do mean odd.''\par \par \uc2 Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , the rare first lady who, like her idol Eleanor Roosevelt, used the job to influence policy and who went on to be a powerful figure, began her own quest for the White House nearly a decade ago with her first run for the nomination against \uc2 Barack Obama\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Back then she presented herself as a steely and even hawkish Democrat who held some views -- opposing gay marriage, supporting free trade, and championing the rights of gun owners -- that she has shifted since her defeat. This time around, she fashioned herself as ''a progressive who likes to get things done'' -- the sort of line-straddling language that makes some liberals dubious of her values and some independents skeptical about her authenticity.\par \par \uc2 Her convention speech comes 47 years after the young Hillary Rodham wound up in Life magazine when she used her commencement address at \uc2 Wellesley College\uc2  to reckon with that era's civic unrest and clashes between protesters and police officers.\par \par \uc2 Her message to the millions of people watching her speech on television Thursday night was similar, as she implored Americans to look past fear and tumult and to choose harmony over hatred. But this time, Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  was to speak to an audience that is deeply distrustful of her. Some 67 percent of all voters and 74 percent of independents said they do not trust Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , in the latest New York Times/CBS News poll.\par \par \uc2 About six weeks ago, Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  started sketching down rough notes about what she wanted to say on the eve she accepts her party's nomination. A month ago, discussions with her top policy adviser, Jake Sullivan, and the speechwriters Dan Schwerin and Megan Rooney, began to shape the speech, with advice from a variety of friends and former speechwriters. Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  also sought advice from Mr. Obama's much-admired former director of speechwriting \uc2 Jon Favreau\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 The speech often electrified the assembled Democrats with its crowd-pleasing lines about Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  like, ''Imagine him in the Oval Office facing a real crisis: A man you can bait with a tweet is not a man we can trust with nuclear weapons.'' And the delegates reveled at the end as confetti rained down on Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  and she playfully swatted at the spill of balloons.\par \par \uc2 For her, though, the greatest exhilaration flowed from the sense that history had been made and that the lives of future generations would be changed forever.\par \par \uc2 ''Standing here as my mother's daughter, and my daughter's mother, I'm so happy this day has come,'' Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  said. ''Happy for grandmothers and little girls and everyone in between. Happy for boys and men, too -- because when any barrier falls in America, for anyone, it clears the way for everyone. When there are no ceilings, the sky's the limit.\par \par \uc2 ''So let's keep going,'' she said, ''until every one of the 161 million women and girls across America has the opportunity she deserves.''\par \par \uc2 Find out what you need to know about the 2016 presidential race today, and get politics news updates via \uc2 Facebook\uc2 , \uc2 Twitter\uc2  and the First Draft newsletter.\par \par \uc2 Correction: July 30, 2016, Saturday\par \par \uc2 This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article on Friday about \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's acceptance of the Democratic Party's presidential nomination referred incorrectly in some editions to coverage of her by Life magazine in 1969.

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 To the Editor:\par \par \uc2 Re ''Obama Champions Optimism, Passing Baton to \uc2 Clinton\uc2 '' (front page, July 28):\par \par \uc2 Every time President Obama speaks like that I feel better about being an American. He reminds us of the hope that binds us together and the collective responsibility we face as citizens to endure its promise so that we as a people can move forward toward that more perfect union.\par \par \uc2 I am not sure what was going on in Cleveland at the Republican convention last week, but President Obama understands who we are, as he sees the best in us and calls on us to serve in this higher calling because this is what makes America great.\par \par \uc2 MICHAEL SCOTT\par \par \uc2 San Francisco\par \par \uc2 To the Editor:\par \par \uc2 Re ''President Obama and the Long March'' (editorial, July 28):\par \par \uc2 Barack Obama\uc2 , from his keynote address to the Democratic convention in Boston in 2004 to the seasoned statesman we saw in Philadelphia on Wednesday night, has truly taken the long march forward. He delivered what was arguably the most impassioned, inspirational address I have ever seen, and he spoke to all Americans, regardless of party affiliation, race, religion or sexual orientation.\par \par \uc2 His sincere enthusiasm for \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , and his confidence in her, were as palpable as his disdain and disgust for \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2 . President Obama showed us why he is so confident that Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  will finish the work he has begun, and why he believes so strongly in the future of our great country.\par \par \uc2 I will miss this president, but I look forward, with the audacity of hope, to a Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  presidency.\par \par \uc2 HENRY A. LOWENSTEIN\par \par \uc2 New York\par \par \uc2 To the Editor:\par \par \uc2 Regarding ''After Lying Low, Deep-Pocketed \uc2 Clinton\uc2  Donors Return to the Fore'' (nytimes.com, July 28):\par \par \uc2 The Democratic convention is just winding down, and already the rich and the powerful -- apparently without shame -- gather to curry favor with the Clintons.\par \par \uc2 Surely, after reading this article, a few more people will start to understand why Bernie Sanders has such devoted, passionate supporters. No one else can be trusted, seemingly. Certainly not \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 The corruption of money in politics is warmly embraced by her. Nothing has changed.\par \par \uc2 NANCY BENNETT O'HAGAN\par \par \uc2 Portland, Me.\par \par \uc2 To the Editor:\par \par \uc2 Re ''\uc2 Trump\uc2  Eggs On Moscow in Hack of \uc2 Clinton\uc2  Email'' (front page, July 28):\par \par \uc2 By trying to keep alive the issue of \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's email server while secretary of state, \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2 , with his usual dangerous lack of judgment, imperils his own candidacy far more than Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's.\par \par \uc2 This same lack of judgment would also greatly imperil our national security if he were to become president.\par \par \uc2 Inviting Russia to hack a former secretary of state's email? If there are still undecided voters out there, could anything else possibly be needed to tip the scale?\par \par \uc2 RANDALL HIRZEL\par \par \uc2 Denver\par \par \uc2 To the Editor:\par \par \uc2 It should be obvious by now that \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  doesn't give any thought to the consequences of his rhetoric.

\par\par \uc2 THE INTERPRETER\par \uc2 Foreign Desk; SECT\par \b \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2 's Appeal to Russia Shocks Foreign Policy Experts\b0\par\par\uc2 By MAX FISHER \par \uc2 1,062 \uc2 words\par \uc2 29 July 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 The New York Times on the Web\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 WASHINGTON -- After all the ways that this year's presidential \uc2 election\uc2  has made history, \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2  found a new line to cross on Wednesday, when he said at a news conference that Russia should hack his opponent, \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 ''Russia, if you're listening, I hope you're able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing,'' Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  said, in reference to the private email server Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  used while she was secretary of state. ''I think you will probably be rewarded mightily by our press.''\par \par \uc2 There is simply no precedent for this: A presidential candidate publicly appealing to a foreign adversary to intervene in the \uc2 election\uc2  on his behalf.\par \par \uc2 ''This is unprecedented -- it is one of those things that seems to be genuinely new in international relations,'' said Paul Musgrave, a University of Massachusetts professor who studies American foreign policy.\par \par \uc2 After a long pause, Mr. Musgrave added, ''Being shocked into speechlessness is not the sort of thing you're really used to in the business of foreign policy analysis.''\par \par \uc2 As part of an investigation into her private server, Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  handed over 30,000 emails to the State Department. But she deleted a similar number of emails that she said were unrelated to her work at the department.\par \par \uc2 American presidential elections are high-stakes events. Russia would not be the first foreign power, friendly or hostile, to pursue its preferred outcome. Nor would Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  be the first politician to leverage foreign actors for electoral benefit.\par \par \uc2 But this is the first time that a presidential candidate has openly asked a foreign power to meddle in the democratic process to his benefit. More than that, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  seemed to be suggesting that Russia should violate United States law on his behalf.\par \par \uc2 Were Russia to follow Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's suggestion, the foreign intervention into American politics would be among the most severe of the past century.\par \par \uc2 In 1940, as the United States debated whether to enter World War II, British spies disseminated rumors to discredit prominent American isolationists and worked to promote politicians who favored intervention.\par \par \uc2 When President \uc2 Jimmy Carter\uc2  ran for re-\uc2 election\uc2  in 1980, he lost in part because he had failed to secure the freedom of 52 American hostages held in Iran. They were released on the day of Ronald Reagan's inauguration. Iranian negotiators later told the journalist Mark Bowden that they had stalled to deliberately hurt Mr. Carter, as punishment for his having sheltered the former Iranian shah.\par \par \uc2 Nations pursue their interests, whether other countries like it or not. Great powers in particular, including the United States, often meddle in foreign elections.\par \par \uc2 But such operations are conducted in secret because they are hostile acts, meant to subvert the will of the targeted country's population and the sanctity of its institutions. Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , in openly inviting such foreign interference, was undercutting one of the most fundamental national interests of a democratic state.\par \par \uc2 ''Nobody ever -- and I think I can be confident about this -- nobody ever stood up at a podium and said, 'Bring it on,''' said Jeremy Shapiro, a \uc2 Brookings Institution\uc2  scholar of foreign policy, referring to Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's invitation for a foreign power to meddle in his own country's politics.\par \par \uc2 Though rare, previous American politicians have looked abroad for help with votes at home.\par \par \uc2 In 1968, as President Lyndon B. Johnson's administration tried to broker peace talks in Vietnam, a Republican activist encouraged South Vietnamese officials to resist the talks, which they did. The activist, who represented herself as speaking for the Republican presidential candidate, Richard M. Nixon, said Mr. Nixon would get South Vietnam a better deal. According to documents that were later declassified, a South Vietnamese official was recorded as saying that his government had refused to participate in the talks as a way ''to help Nixon.''\par \par \uc2 More recently, in 2012, the Republican presidential challenger, \uc2 Mitt Romney\uc2 , cultivated ties with Prime Minister \uc2 Benjamin Netanyahu\uc2  of Israel. While Mr. Netanyahu did not explicitly endorse Mr. Romney, he frequently voiced his acute dissatisfaction with President Obama in comments to the American news media.\par \par \uc2 Three years later, as Mr. Obama tried to strike a nuclear deal with Iran, congressional Republicans invited Mr. Netanyahu to condemn the proposed accord in a speech to Congress.\par \par \uc2 While this arguably violated the norms of foreign policy by circumventing the White House on a matter of foreign relations, and by inviting an ally to intervene against the president in a domestic political dispute, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  went a large step further in soliciting an adversary, and encouraging it to violate United States law on his behalf.\par \par \uc2 In the hours after Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's statement, foreign policy and legal analysts struggled to articulate the scale of his deviation from political norms.\par \par \uc2 William Inboden, a University of Texas professor who served on President George W. Bush's National Security Council, told \uc2 Politico\uc2  the comments were ''an assault on the Constitution'' and ''tantamount to treason.''\par \par \uc2 Carl Bildt, the former Swedish prime minister and foreign minister, wrote on \uc2 Twitter\uc2 , ''I never thought a serious candidate for US President could be a serious threat against the security of the West. But that's where we are.''\par \par \uc2 It is doubtful that Russia will alter its espionage practices based on public suggestions from Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , which some defenders argue was meant as a joke. But Mr. Musgrave worried that such language could weaken norms, even if only slightly, against foreign involvement in American politics.\par \par \uc2 ''\uc2 Trump\uc2  is legitimating behaviors that nobody ever thought could be legitimated,'' Mr. Musgrave said, calling the incident ''one of those reminders about how fragile norms are.''\par \par \uc2 Mr. Shapiro, the \uc2 Brookings Institution\uc2  scholar, sounded physically exhausted by Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's comments and suggested they were driven by something more banal than collusion with a foreign power.\par \par \uc2 ''To me what it demonstrates is not that he's necessarily in cahoots with the Russians, or that he's intending to commit treason or sway the \uc2 election\uc2  by this act, but that he just has no sense of what the norms are,'' Mr. Shapiro said, adding:\par \par \uc2 ''He has no sense of what an extraordinary statement that was.''\par \par \uc2 The Interpreter is a new column that explores the ideas and context behind major world events.\par \par \uc2 Follow Max Fisher on Twitter @Max_Fisher .\par \par \uc2 Document NYTF000020160729ec7t0005g\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 National Desk; SECTA\par \b \uc2 After 240 Years, Women See a Female President Lifting Them All\b0\par\par\uc2 By JODI KANTOR; Reporting was contributed by Jess Bidgood, Christina Capecchi, Natalie Pita and Nate Schweber. \par \uc2 1,327 \uc2 words\par \uc2 29 July 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 1\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 The president would know what it is like to be pregnant. Top military leaders would answer to a female boss, when there has never even been a woman on the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Workplaces and home life could be transformed through expanded parental leave and pay equity. Or nothing could change. The symbolism would be supernova-level. The backlash could be withering.\par \par \uc2 On Thursday night, 240 years into an unbroken chain of all-male leadership, \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  accepted the Democratic nomination for president. The country may be one hard-fought \uc2 election\uc2  away from a woman in charge, making a question that has always been abstract more concrete: How could having a woman as president alter the experience of being an American woman?\par \par \uc2 ''Women will get fair wages,'' said Tammy Keith, 53, a caseworker who lives in East New York, Brooklyn, and estimated that she has been paid about $20,000 less than her male counterparts over the last 14 years.\par \par \uc2 The more boldly Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  acted, the more empowered women would feel, said Marqui Wilcher, 25, a supervisor at a Pittsburgh call center and a single mother. ''Don't go in there and cower down,'' she said, as if speaking to the nominee.\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 election\uc2  of the first woman to the White House could revitalize stalled issues of workplace equality, said Jeanne Crain, 56, the chief executive of a bank in St. Paul. ''I think there are ways for me as a leader here to use this as a springboard -- shame on me -- in ways I haven't done,'' she said.\par \par \uc2 All week, cameras at the convention hall in Philadelphia have captured images of women weeping, hugging and cheering on Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 . Dozens of other women across the country, in interviews at their offices or alongside their children, also said they felt on the cusp of a major, collective step forward. A few said it would make no difference: ''Oh my God, it's a woman, blah blah blah,'' said Kristin Shearer, 45, a \uc2 Trump\uc2  supporter in Cambridge, Mass.\par \par \uc2 But most of the women interviewed -- from their teens to their 90s, Democrats and Republicans, store clerks to executives -- believed that a female presidency could somehow be a force in their own lives, even if they did not yet know how.\par \par \uc2 Some female leaders of other countries, like Indira Gandhi in India and Benazir Bhutto in Pakistan, accumulated power in sharp contrast to their countrywomen, who had very little. But if Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  wins the presidency, she would take office during a period of economic and demographic transformation for American women, who are outnumbering men in college enrollment by ever widening margins, becoming primary breadwinners and heading their own households.\par \par \uc2 State-mandated parental leave is slowly coming into place for the first time in American history. As commander in chief, one of Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's tasks would be to finish the integration of women into combat roles in the United States military.\par \par \uc2 But historic expectations can also set up deep disappointments. In the interviews, many women expressed pent-up wishes born of a slow-to-change culture and hard-lived personal experience. If Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  is elected, those dreams may crash hard. Cracking an opening in a glass ceiling is not the same as dismantling it, said Marianne Cooper, a Stanford sociologist who was the lead researcher for \uc2 Sheryl Sandberg\uc2 's book ''Lean In.''\par \par \uc2 ''To really shatter the glass ceiling would mean she was upending the forces that are barriers for women,'' she said. Those are ''really difficult for any single individual from an underrepresented group to undo,'' she added. ''And in four years?''\par \par \uc2 As a candidate, \uc2 Barack Obama\uc2  often tried to lower expectations for what he would be able to achieve for African-Americans as president. But Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's campaign agenda tries to lift hopes for women: Vast expansions in paid family and medical leave. An end -- her website uses that word -- to campus sexual assault. Limiting child care costs to 10 percent of a family's income while giving providers raises at the same time. Abolishing the ban on federal funds for abortion.\par \par \uc2 But it is not yet entirely clear how a President \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  might fund or enact some of her proposals. Congress is frozen, and politics requires compromises that often disappoint. American feminism is a raucous mishmash of pop culture heroines, reproductive rights advocates, anti-rape activists and others, glued together by little more than fervent online debate.\par \par \uc2 And there are few unifying legacy organizations like the N.A.A.C.P., the \uc2 Urban League\uc2  or even new groups like Black Lives Matter to push her agenda. She could easily find herself in a position similar to that President \uc2 Obama\uc2  has faced on race, with some of her own calling her a disappointment at the same time as opponents allege she is a radical who is going way too far.\par \par \uc2 Her life has already been a canvas for debates about stay-at-home motherhood, marriage, ambition and the tendency of female leaders to be perceived as less likable. As the occupant of the Oval Office, the scrutiny could be even more relentless.\par \par \uc2 Some of the women interviewed took for granted that Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  would be hit with nasty attacks, like the recent chants of ''lock her up'' at the Republican convention. But they sounded even more worried that she would face harsher criticism than a male president for whatever large or small mistakes she makes. (A recent Yale study found that women in traditionally male occupations are judged more severely when they make the same mistakes as men in those jobs.)\par \par \uc2 ''What do I fear? That her leadership would be seen as 'dramatic' or 'bossy' or 'unlikable' because society really struggles to accept women in power,'' Kristina Dahl, 46, a director of a cancer support organization in Seattle, said on \uc2 Facebook\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 The question is whether a President \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  would be re-enacting familiar gender dynamics on a larger stage or shifting them, in part just by showing up to work each day.\par \par \uc2 ''When a young woman walks into a classroom, a 15-year-old boy will think to himself, she could be president one day,'' said Abby Wambach, 36, the soccer player and the author of a forthcoming memoir that describes her fight for equality as a female athlete, who has campaigned for Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Other women say that if she wins, they may change their own behavior. The novelist Ann Patchett, 52, said that the \uc2 election\uc2  of a female president could convince her to hand over more domestic chores to her husband. She is a best-selling author and bookstore owner, but a woman in the Oval Office would help her believe that her work is as important as her physician husband's, she said.\par \par \uc2 Other women feel dawning possibility, but are not entirely sure what to expect. Nancy Lyons, 50, the chief executive of a design and technology agency in Minneapolis, came up with her own analogy to describe what the moment means for her.\par \par \uc2 Watching Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  accept the nomination is like witnessing the space missions of her childhood, she said. \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  is in a place no woman has ever been before, possibly about to go even further. She needs to execute precisely, to show great endurance and daring. Ms. Lyons is both cheering and dreading failure.\par \par \uc2 ''\uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  is like an astronaut now,'' she said.\par \par \uc2 Find out what you need to know about the 2016 presidential race today, and get politics news updates via \uc2 Facebook\uc2 , \uc2 Twitter\uc2  and the First Draft newsletter.\par \par \uc2 (PHOTOGRAPH BY DAMON WINTER/THE NEW YORK TIMES) (A1); A Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  rally last week in Tampa, Fla.

Noah Remnick contributed reporting from Davenport, Iowa. \par \uc2 1,064 \uc2 words\par \uc2 29 July 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 14\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 GRAND RAPIDS, Mich. -- Facing a torrent of criticism over his comments seeming to condone the hacking of \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's emails by Russian intelligence services, \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2  and his allies on Thursday sought to tamp down his remarks, with Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  saying he was simply being ''sarcastic.''\par \par \uc2 In public interviews and private conversations on Thursday, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 ; his running mate, \uc2 Gov. Mike Pence\uc2  of Indiana; and campaign staff members contended that Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  was being facetious when, during a news conference on Wednesday, he said he hoped Russia would be able to find Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's missing emails.\par \par \uc2 ''Of course I'm being sarcastic,'' Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  told ''Fox and Friends'' Thursday morning as his aides accused the news media of misconstruing his remarks.\par \par \uc2 And in an interview Thursday with the conservative radio host Laura Ingraham, Mr. Pence repeatedly said that Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  was merely joking.\par \par \uc2 ''He went on, using a statement laced with sarcasm, to point out that there are 33,000 missing emails, according to the F.B.I., that \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  deleted or did not make available in the course of that investigation,'' Mr. Pence told Ms. Ingraham.\par \par \uc2 But the assertions that his remarks should not be taken at face value were at odds with statements put out by Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  and his aides right after his news conference on Wednesday. Those statements insisted that Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  was urging Russia to return any purloined property to the F.B.I.\par \par \uc2 Aides to both Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  and Mr. Pence were clearly caught off guard by Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's impromptu comments on Wednesday -- when he said, ''Russia, if you're listening, I hope you're able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing'' -- and were surprised by the swift and immediate reaction to them, especially in the news media.\par \par \uc2 The extraordinary moment -- in which the Republican nominee basically urged Russia, an adversary, to conduct cyberespionage against a former secretary of state -- again left Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  isolated from even some fellow Republicans, struggling to explain away another comment that had dominated yet another news cycle, and not necessarily in a positive way.\par \par \uc2 Ed Brookover, a \uc2 Trump\uc2  campaign liaison to the \uc2 Republican National Committee\uc2 , said that the substance of Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's emails was what was most important -- not Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's remarks.\par \par \uc2 ''The truth about the emails is that Hillary's record as secretary of state was abysmal, and her lack of security left our secrets vulnerable,'' Mr. Brookover said. ''Let's hope that no foreign countries did get access to her private email account.''\par \par \uc2 On Thursday, even while trying to reframe his original comments, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  reiterated his remarks from a day earlier that President \uc2 Vladimir V. Putin\uc2  of Russia is ''a better leader'' than President Obama.\par \par \uc2 ''I said he's a better leader than Obama because Obama's not a leader, so he's certainly doing a better job than Obama is, and that's all,'' Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  said in the ''Fox and Friends'' interview.\par \par \uc2 ''But you have 33,000 emails deleted, and the real problem is what was said in those emails from the \uc2 Democratic National Committee\uc2 ,'' Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  said. ''You take a look at what was said in those emails, it's disgraceful. It's disgraceful.''\par \par \uc2 For the second day in a row, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  seemed to be conflating the roughly 30,000 emails on Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's private server during her time as secretary of state that her lawyers deleted as personal, and the roughly 20,000 \uc2 Democratic National Committee\uc2  emails that were hacked.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's efforts to recalibrate his original remarks Wednesday began just hours after his news conference.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  posted on \uc2 Twitter\uc2  on Wednesday that he was simply urging Russia, if it had indeed hacked Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , to hand her emails over to the proper authorities.\par \par \uc2 ''If Russia or any other country or person has \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's 33,000 illegally deleted emails, perhaps they should share them with the F.B.I!'' Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  wrote.\par \par \uc2 Republicans were largely muted Thursday in their defense of Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , save for \uc2 Rudolph W. Giuliani\uc2 , the former New York mayor, who is a supporter.\par \par \uc2 ''That server of hers was less secure than the D.N.C. server that was hacked,'' Mr. Giuliani said at a news conference in Philadelphia, adding that he was ''sure'' Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  wanted the emails sent to the F.B.I. ''Those emails are being held by people. They should be released before the \uc2 election\uc2 .''\par \par \uc2 In her radio interview Thursday morning, Ms. Ingraham asked Mr. Pence, ''Should Americans be concerned that the Republican nominee is inviting a foreign government to hack into government emails?''\par \par \uc2 Mr. Pence echoed the campaign's public posture, saying several times that Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  was just being ''sarcastic'' -- and he sought to recast Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's remarks.\par \par \uc2 ''Well, it's absolutely not what he said,'' Mr. Pence said. ''What he said -- what I said -- was, clearly, if Russia or any foreign country was interfering or intervening or engaging in illegal activity in the United States, in our elections or otherwise, that there be serious consequences.''\par \par \uc2 At an afternoon rally Thursday in Davenport, Iowa, supporters of Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  offered almost uniform absolution for the comments, saying they believed he had been speaking facetiously.\par \par \uc2 ''I don't think he was being serious,'' said Tom Taylor, 68, a retiree from Wilton, Iowa. ''It's just media spin. He's not a professional politician like the rest of them, so sometimes people misinterpret what he says.''\par \par \uc2 Still, some supporters allowed that Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  might have been imprudent in his remarks.\par \par \uc2 ''Maybe he shouldn't have said that about Russia,'' said Joan Watson, 63, from Walnut, Ill. ''It just gives the Democrats more material for ads. I think he was just trying to get a reaction. But even if he was kidding, he knows Russia could probably do it.''\par \par \uc2 In a common refrain among the people waiting for the rally to begin, Dan Brethaner said of the comments, ''That's just Donald being Donald.''\par \par \uc2 Find out what you need to know about the 2016 presidential race today, and get politics news updates via \uc2 Facebook\uc2 , \uc2 Twitter\uc2  and the First Draft newsletter.\par \par \uc2 Document NYTF000020160729ec7t0004m\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

John Paul II was the first Polish pope in the church's 2,000-year history. Auschwitz is less than an hour from where he was born, and his 1979 visit was poignant. Every bit as dramatic was the 2006 visit by the German-born Benedict XVI who had at 14 been a member of the Hitler Youth.\par \par \uc2 But Francis' visit could be the most significant ever if he uses the symbolic backdrop to break with the policies of six predecessors over 70 years and order the release of the Vatican's sealed Holocaust-era archives.\par \par \uc2 The debate over the church's secret wartime files is not new. The Vatican is the only country in Europe that refuses to open all of its World War II archives to independent historians and researchers. The issue is more than simply an academic debate over the appropriate rules for public disclosure of historically significant documents. The church's files are thought to contain important information about the Holocaust in Nazi-occupied Eastern Europe. The Vatican had eyes and ears in the killing fields: tens of thousands of parish priests who sent letters and reports to their bishops, who in turn forwarded them to the secretary of state in Vatican City. One of the monsignors in charge of reviewing those thousands of reports was Giovanni Battista Montini, later Pope Paul VI.\par \par \uc2 It is little wonder that historians are eager to study the Vatican's Holocaust-era papers. The accounts by the parish priests may help answer lingering questions of when and what the Vatican knew about the Nazi murder machinery. The files are likely to shed light on whether the wartime pope, Pius XII, could have done more to try to stop the Holocaust. Also buried inside the secret archives are the early records of the scandal-ridden \uc2 Vatican Bank\uc2 , created during World War II. Those documents could resolve conclusively how much business the Vatican did with the Third Reich, as well as the extent of insurance company investments that yielded enormous profits from life insurance policies of Jews sent to Auschwitz, which I uncovered in my own reporting.\par \par \uc2 And finally, the church's secret files might resolve the debate over whether several postwar refugee-smuggling networks that were run from Rome separately by an Austrian bishop, a German priest and a Croatian priest -- and through which Nazi criminals escaped -- were freelance operations, or instead parts of a program that had the pope's blessing.\par \par \uc2 The church has since the 1960s released some wartime files, while refusing unfettered access by historians. In the 1990s, the administration of President Bill \uc2 Clinton\uc2  ordered federal agencies to release relevant Holocaust files, and also spearheaded an effort that persuaded several dozen other nations to do the same. The Vatican was an outlier.\par \par \uc2 The 2013 \uc2 election\uc2  of \uc2 Pope Francis\uc2  held out the promise for a change in the church's longstanding policy of secrecy. While still the archbishop of Buenos Aires, he had been asked about the dispute over the Holocaust-era files. The Vatican, he answered, ''should open them and clarify everything.'' Many Vaticanologists thought he would use a 2014 visit to Israel to free the files. But Francis did not say anything publicly about the papers on that visit.\par \par \uc2 Francis last discussed the issue in a November 2014 interview with the Israeli newspaper Yediot Ahronot. The pope asked: ''Did Pius XII remain silent in the face of the extermination of the Jews? Did he say all he should have said? We will have to open the archives to know exactly what happened.'' According to Francis: ''There is an agreement between the Vatican and Italy from 1929 that prevents us from opening the archives to researchers at this point in time. But because of the time that has passed since World War II, I see no problem with opening the archives the moment we sort out the legal and bureaucratic matters.''\par \par \uc2 The 1929 agreement Francis cited is the Lateran Pacts between the Vatican and Benito Mussolini's Fascist Italy. It gave the church full sovereignty over Vatican City. The agreement declared that the pope was not only the equivalent of a secular monarch but also endowed with divine rights. Instead of preventing the church from releasing its archives, as Francis suggested, the agreement invests the Vatican with inviolable powers to set its own policies independent of any interference from Italy. All that is required to open the long-sealed archives is a papal decree.\par \par \uc2 Jewish advocacy groups, human rights organizations and concentration camp survivors hope that Francis' commitment to reform will \uc2 trump\uc2  the desire of Vatican traditionalists to keep the documents buried forever. On the very grounds where the Nazis murdered more than a million victims, most of them Jews, \uc2 Pope Francis\uc2  can do much more than have a photo opportunity and offer a generic condemnation of the depths of human depravity. By freeing the Vatican's Holocaust-era files he will pay a singular and lasting tribute to the dead.\par \par \uc2 Gerald Posner is the author, most recently, of ''God's Bankers: A History of Money and Power at the Vatican.''\par \par \uc2 DRAWING (DRAWING BY ANTHONY RUSSO) \par \par \uc2 Document NYTF000020160729ec7t0006k\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 'Melodrama, Act 2: New York'\par \par \uc2 Luxembourg & Dayan\par \par \uc2 64 East 77th Street, Manhattan\par \par \uc2 Through Sept. 17\par \par \uc2 This sparely theatrical and uncommonly evocative exhibition consists of three sculptures and a video. At one end of the gallery, two busts on pedestals make up a tableau about creative imagination. One portrays the composer Giuseppe Verdi. Rendered in dark wax over plaster by the Italian sculptor Vincenzo Gemito (1852-1929) in 1873, Verdi is beetle-browed with deep-set eyes, thick hair and a heavy beard, and appears profoundly thoughtful. Looking toward him is ''Italian Woman,'' a gleaming, stainless-steel, Rococo-style representation of a beautiful woman made by Jeff Koons in 1986. She might be Verdi's muse. Letters inscribed into the sculpture's base identify her as Lucia Mondella, a character from an 1827 novel, ''The Betrothed'' by Alessandro Manzoni, considered one of the great works of Italian literature.\par \par \uc2 At the gallery's other end, the subject is hands, the sculptor's primary tool. Urs Fischer's ''Foxtrot'' (2015) has a realistic pair of detached hands resting on the back of a red plastic chair. Next to it, Richard Serra's three-minute, black-and-white film, ''Hand Catching Lead'' (1968), loops on a small screen. It shows the artist's dirty hand repeatedly attempting and usually failing to catch small sheets of lead falling from above.\par \par \uc2 The second part of a trans-Atlantic production organized by the independent curator Francesco Bonami (''Act 1'' is in the gallery's London space), the exhibition inspires meditation on the archetypal wedding of mind and body out of which all art is born. \uc2 KEN JOHNSON\par \par \uc2 Anna Sew Hoy\par \par \uc2 'Invisible Tattoo'\par \par \uc2 Koenig & \uc2 Clinton\par \par \uc2 459 West 19th Street, Chelsea\par \par \uc2 Closes on Friday\par \par \uc2 If sculpture's basic task is to think imaginatively about three-dimensional form and challenge the relationship between space and objects, Anna Sew Hoy does so beautifully in ''Invisible Tattoo.'' But as the enigmatic title of the exhibition suggests, Ms. Hoy sets out to do more, teasing the boundaries between art and craft, melding different artistic lineages and evoking a sense of vision and form as a kind of mirage.\par \par \uc2 This is most obvious in the eponymous work, ''Invisible Tattoo'' (2016), a two-part sculpture made of deconstructed jeans molded around oval mirrors and placed on cinder-block pedestals. Here you feel the organic shapes and mind-bending distortions of 1960s art and architecture as well as mirrors that recall Lewis Carroll's ''Alice's Adventures in Wonderland,'' which became a psychedelic touchstone for that era.\par \par \uc2 Other sculptures use wires and steel and jeans ripped down to their seams or stuffed and resewn, snaking up the wall or slithering across the floor. Ms. Hoy's use of denim feels appropriate for a moment when jeans are so popular they range from artisanal to mass-produced, from skinny to boyfriend to high-rise. We seem to have unlimited choice -- but this, too, is a mirage, constricted by culturally dictated ideas about beauty and sexiness. In the gallery, Ms. Hoy offers a glimpse of a different realm, fantastic and impossible, where you could get a tattoo, an indelible mark on the body that just might be invisible.\par \par \uc2 MARTHA SCHWENDENER\par \par \uc2 'For Freedoms'\par \par \uc2 Jack Shainman Gallery\par \par \uc2 513 West 20th Street and 524 West 24th Street, Chelsea\par \par \uc2 Through Aug. 5\par \par \uc2 In this surreal presidential \uc2 election\uc2  year, the unlikely idea of an artist-run super PAC seems normal enough, and there is one, advertised as a first, headquartered at both branches of Shainman Gallery in Chelsea. Founded by Eric Gottesman and Hank Willis Thomas, the organization uses the money it raises, directly from donors or through the sale of art, less to advocate specific presidential candidates than to push social ideals that some of them may, with encouragement, promote.\par \par \uc2 The basic ideals are the Four Freedoms defined by Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1941 -- freedom of speech and worship, freedom from want and from fear -- and illustrated by Norman Rockwell in paintings that became posters for war bonds two years later. Copies of the posters are in the show, surrounded with less confidently utopian material by politically minded contemporary artists, some familiar (Trevor Paglen, Dread Scott, Mickalene Thomas, Carrie Mae Weems), others with still-building careers (Nina Chanel Abney, Wyatt Gallery, Coby Kennedy, Kameelah Janan Rasheed, Michele Pred, Will Steacy).\par \par \uc2 Both Shainman spaces have been set up as a combination of office and workshop. On certain days those present include an artist in residence (Ahron D. Weiner, designer of the super PAC's advertising campaign) and a scholar in residence (Domingo Borges, a former prison inmate, who gives presentations on the criminal justice system). A schedule of activities is at forfreedoms.org.\par \par \uc2 Although the leftward political leanings of this particular super PAC are unmistakable, the goal set by Mr. Gottesman and Mr. Thomas is general: demonstrate that art can be introduced into the mechanism of mainstream politics, and argue that activism in art is an end in itself, beyond partisanship. The results here take many forms.\par \par \uc2 Text posters by Ms. Rasheed cut Rockwellian romanticism with street-smart humor. A painting by Pablo Helguera, which consists of the words ''All proceeds from the sale of this art work will go to the \uc2 Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund\uc2 ,'' seamlessly unites message and medium. A banner by Mr. Scott emblazoned with the phrase ''A Man Was Lynched by Police Yesterday'' brings together history (a similar banner, without the words ''by police,'' appeared outside the offices of the N.A.A.C.P. in Manhattan in the 1930s) and current topical politics.\par \par \uc2 When Mr. Scott placed the banner outside Shainman's 20th Street space in the days after the fatal shootings of Philando Castile, Alton B. Sterling, and five police officers in Dallas, the gallery was the target of protests. The banner, which now hangs in the gallery window rather than over the street, is solid evidence that, if its message is strong and the timing is right, art in the public sphere can cause a stir. ''For Freedoms'' is bent on widening that sphere and extending the stir.\par \par \uc2 HOLLAND COTTER\par \par \uc2 Wendy White\par \par \uc2 'Santa Cruz'\par \par \uc2 Eric Firestone Gallery\par \par \uc2 4 Great Jones Street, Manhattan\par \par \uc2 Closes on Saturday\par \par \uc2 Nothing seems further from surfing and skateboarding in Southern California than a white cube gallery in New York. However, the aesthetics of these sports, with their boldly designed surfaces and the bright colors of the sun and sea, and the Zen-like concentration of participants, have frequently infiltrated and influenced contemporary art. Wendy White makes ample reference to both -- and particularly 1980s surf and skate culture -- in her show, ''Santa Cruz.''\par \par \uc2 Ms. White does not actually depict skaters and surfers. Instead, she channels the ethos of that scene and era with large blue-and-gray abstract paintings, sometimes draped with rainbow netting, and decals printed on the canvases and the wall. Pieces of black plastic cut into a heart with jagged edges and a cloud with three raindrops, both suspended from the ceiling by colored rope, conjure early computer icons and suggest an easy-to-use approach to art.\par \par \uc2 By drawing on the '80s Ms. White evokes a sense of nostalgia that is particular to her own experience but that translates well into the art realm. Artists, surfers and skateboarders all lament the professionalization of their spheres, in which the passionate play and radical experimentation are transformed into ''training'' or ''branding.'' Painters now get graduate degrees to participate in the art system; elite skaters and surfers are sponsored by companies manufacturing everything from energy drinks to underwear. Artists aren't generally sponsored like that yet, with a list of products and companies associated with their names, but maybe it's just a matter of time before they are.\par \par \uc2 MARTHA SCHWENDENER\par \par \uc2 'The Female Gaze, Part Two'\par \par \uc2 'Women Look at Men'\par \par \uc2 Cheim & Read\par \par \uc2 547 West 25th Street, Chelsea\par \par \uc2 Through Sept. 2\par \par \uc2 What do women see in men? ''The Female Gaze, Part Two: Women Look at Men'' does not definitively answer this question, but it offers plenty to talk about in the form of 38 paintings, drawings, sculptures and photographs depicting men or parts of men by 32 women. (The first part, presented in 2009, featured images of women made by women.)\par \par \uc2 While nearly all the show's works focus on men's bodies, hardly any do so with the sort of lubricious avidity often seen in female nudes by men. Painted with exactingly sensuous realism, Catherine Murphy's ''Harry's Nipple'' (2003) represents a man's hairy breast seen through a hole in his shirt, a comic rejoinder to the fetishization of female nipples. Sylvia Sleigh's ''Paul Rosano in Jacobsen Chair '' (1971), a portrait of a nude young man, turns the tables on the female odalisque. It's more a feminist conceptual gambit than a vision of sexual desire. In Cecily Brown's ''Raspberry Beret'' (2015-16), the image of a nude reclining man nearly dissolved into a busy allover welter of painterly gestures, there's more erotic sensuality in the paint than in the figure.\par \par \uc2 Several works concentrate on the penis. It seems to be viewed with horrified fascination in ''White Nob'' (2013) by Sarah Lucas, a monstrous, snowy white plaster sculpture of an erect phallus standing 43\u189\'00\'BD inches. It could be in homage to the ancient fertility god Priapus.\par \par \uc2 KEN JOHNSON\par \par \uc2 This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.\par \par \uc2 Urs Fischer's ''Foxtrot,'' left, and Richard Serra's ''Hand Catching Lead'' in ''Melodrama, Act 2.''

\par\par \uc2 National Desk; SECTA\par \b \uc2 Envisioning a Team: \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , \uc2 Clinton\uc2  and, Maybe, \uc2 Clinton\b0\par\par\uc2 By MATT FLEGENHEIMER and PATRICK HEALY \par \uc2 1,501 \uc2 words\par \uc2 29 July 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 9\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 PHILADELPHIA -- \uc2 Bill \uc2 Clinton\uc2  does not know his way around a china pattern.\par \par \uc2 He is unlikely, friends said, to dwell on the trimmings of the White House Christmas tree.\par \par \uc2 And if he is still smooth at small talk when he must be, happy to riff on sports and science until the last guest has left, the staid ceremonial duties of a presidential spouse do not hold much appeal.\par \par \uc2 With this in mind, old family hands have gravitated toward a typical Clintonian solution should the former president find himself as first gentleman in 2017: Perhaps the first daughter could help.\par \par \uc2 Just as she assumed a lead role in her father's foundation and became a chief campaign surrogate for her mother, \uc2 Chelsea \uc2 Clinton\uc2  is willing to step up should her parents need her if they return to the White House, according to the former first daughter's friends.\par \par \uc2 She is the third partner in the family business of being Clintons, and Ms. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's bond with her parents, so familiar to Americans from her adolescence in the 1990s, was on display once more on Thursday. One week after \uc2 Ivanka \uc2 Trump\uc2  served as her father's chief character witness at the Republican gathering in Cleveland, Ms. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  introduced her mother at the convention inside the Wells Fargo Center, making the case for \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's compassion and maternal touch.\par \par \uc2 ''That feeling of being valued and loved -- that's what my mom wants for every child,'' she told the crowd. ''It is the calling of her life.''\par \par \uc2 Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's historic nomination has already scrambled the established political family order, compelling Mr. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  on Tuesday night to deliver his own take on a traditional first-spouse speech: a former president producing a humanizing, if airbrushed, portrait of a partner and a parent.\par \par \uc2 Clinton\uc2  advisers say that \uc2 Chelsea \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's influence and involvement in a prospective administration have not been given much thought. But they also say that Ms. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  is likely to lend a hand around major events and holidays, at least by phone and email, and to help her father with some of the traditional duties of a president's spouse.\par \par \uc2 ''She has a deep bond with them, and she knows that she can be a lot of help to them if they return to the White House,'' said \uc2 Thomas F. McLarty III\uc2 , known as Mack, a close friend of the Clintons and a former chief of staff to Mr. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 . ''Chelsea is so substantive, and has two young children, that I don't see her playing White House social secretary. But I do think she will chip in to help her father and mother with managing life in the White House.''\par \par \uc2 Given that the spousal role often comes down to what the person makes of it, Mr. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  has some freedom to rethink the job, and Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  has signaled that she would want him to play a policy role. But the Clintons are also sensitive to not giving short shrift to the influence that first ladies have had, and advisers to the couple say that the three Clintons, as a family, will discuss ways to carry out that role.\par \par \uc2 Betty Ford arguably had more long-term impact on American life, by easing stigmas on breast cancer and alcoholism, than her one-term husband did. Jackie Kennedy and \uc2 Nancy Reagan\uc2  defined style for many women of their generations. Lady Bird Johnson remains deeply admired as a symbol of strength and loyalty to her husband. So does Eleanor Roosevelt, who became a political force in her own right.\par \par \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  redefined the role of first lady by taking on a policy role on health care -- failing on the goal of national health insurance but succeeding with congressional allies to enact the federal children's health insurance programs. And \uc2 Michelle Obama\uc2  has been a significant role model for women of color and a particular inspiration for young black girls in low-income communities.\par \par \uc2 But any suggestion that \uc2 Chelsea \uc2 Clinton\uc2  might be relied upon to perform traditional first-lady tasks has the potential to strike a nerve, prompting concerns about an overly gendered view of presidential family roles.\par \par \uc2 And such a role might seem incongruent with Ms. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's graduate degrees from Oxford and Columbia and her career in business consulting and nonprofit management. But friends of Ms. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  say she would never be offended if her parents asked her for help. Her mother, after all, was a Yale Law School star and accomplished lawyer when she threw herself into the role of first lady in the 1990s.\par \par \uc2 Ms. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  is 36 -- on the millennial borderline -- seasoned enough to headline panels on global health and women's rights and young enough, particularly in her mother's orbit of high-profile supporters, to serve as an ambassador of sorts to 20-somethings skeptical of the \uc2 Clinton\uc2  name.\par \par \uc2 She has two children, Charlotte, almost 2, and a 5-week-old, Aidan. She will not be moving back into the White House.\par \par \uc2 ''I honestly think she's trying to get through the convention,'' said Elizabeth Weindruch, a childhood friend from Little Rock, Ark., stressing that Ms. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  had not determined what she hoped to focus on after the \uc2 election\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 It was a heady week for Ms. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , preparing to address the convention 24 years after joining her parents, as not quite yet a teenager, in New York for her father's nomination.\par \par \uc2 In 1992, she grinned through orthodontic braces, played cards with friends and sustained a minor sightseeing injury. (She got leg cramps racing up the steps at the Statue of Liberty with Ms. Weindruch.)\par \par \uc2 ''We were just kids running around New York,'' Ms. Weindruch said Wednesday, en route to Philadelphia to be with Ms. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  once more.\par \par \uc2 Ms. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's schedule this week was at least as busy.\par \par \uc2 On Tuesday night, perched in a box beside her husband, Marc Mezvinsky, and Senator Elizabeth Warren, Ms. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  choked up throughout her father's speech. He recalled the evening of her birth, the time they watched a ''Police Academy'' marathon, the day he dropped her off at college (Stanford) as Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  spread liner paper across a drawer.\par \par \uc2 On Wednesday, Ms. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  held forth on gay rights and voter outreach at a lunch for the \uc2 Human Rights Campaign\uc2 , earning two standing ovations and telling the crowd that she had been straining to suppress tears all week.\par \par \uc2 An attendee, John Klenert, said he had watched Ms. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  grow up. He ''felt sorry for her'' in her youth, he said, marveling at her evolution now.\par \par \uc2 And he chafed, unprompted, at grumblings that Ms. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  should assist her mother in social affairs. ''It's an insult,'' he said. ''If and when Hillary is in the White House, she can hire somebody.''\par \par \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's campaign is likewise considering how it might put family members to best use if the Republican nominee is elected.\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 Trump\uc2  team has made clear that Ivanka, his oldest daughter, would take a leading role in an administration, along with her husband, \uc2 Jared Kushner\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 At a panel event on Tuesday, Ms. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  took aim at Ms. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , with whom she had become friends in recent years, in response to a question about Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's policies.\par \par \uc2 Ms. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  reminded the crowd that some of Ms. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's paeans to women's economic issues in her convention speech last week bore little resemblance to anything Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  had said on the campaign trail.\par \par \uc2 ''There are no policies on any of those fronts that you just mentioned on his website,'' she said, imagining a conversation with Ms. \uc2 Trump\uc2 . ''Not last week, not this week.''\par \par \uc2 A few minutes later, the youth-focused gathering -- hosted by Glamour and \uc2 Facebook\uc2 , with an open bar -- neared its end with an appearance from a pant-suited dance group, performing to a Beyonc\u233\'00\'E9 song.\par \par \uc2 Soon, the party was over. Ms. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  smiled politely and walked off the stage. She was expected a short while later in the convention hall, to cheer her parents on.\par \par \uc2 Find out what you need to know about the 2016 presidential race today, and get politics news updates via \uc2 Facebook\uc2 , \uc2 Twitter\uc2  and the First Draft newsletter.\par \par \uc2 Chelsea \uc2 Clinton\uc2  introduced her mother on Thursday night in Philadelphia.

Mark Rylance is very good as the melancholy, steadfast title character, whose relationship with a little girl named Sophie (Ruby Barnhill) propels an episodic, slightly tedious narrative. (A. O. Scott)\par \par \uc2 'Caf\u233\'00\'E9 Society' (PG-13, 1:36) Woody Allen wanders back into the worlds of 1930s Hollywood and New York, patching together an intermittently amusing, visually elegant collage of familiar themes. Steve Carell is a powerful movie agent, Jesse Eisenberg is his ambitious nephew from the Bronx, and Kristen Stewart is the young woman they both love. She's too good for either one of them, and also for this tired movie. (Scott)\par \par \uc2 \u9733\'26\'05 'Captain Fantastic' (R, 1:59) Viggo Mortensen stars in this pleasurably freewheeling movie about a young family who leave the radical isolation of their Oregon home and go back on the grid. The writer and director Matt Ross takes both his characters and his audience seriously. (Manohla Dargis)\par \par \uc2 'Central Intelligence' (PG-13, 1:54) Reuniting two former high school acquaintances (Kevin Hart and Dwayne Johnson) for an odd-couple caper of staggering dopiness, the director Rawson Marshall Thurber creates a clean-out-the-fridge soup of celebrity cameos and C.I.A. confusion. (Jeannette Catsoulis)\par \par \uc2 \u9733\'26\'05 'The Conjuring 2' (R, 2:14) This worthy sequel reunites Vera Farmiga and Patrick Wilson as the real-life paranormal investigators Lorraine and Ed Warren. This time they're looking into mysterious goings-on in a house in London. James Wan again directs and serves up some good scares, and a youngster named Madison Wolfe gives an attention-getting performance as a possessed child. (Neil Genzlinger)\par \par \uc2 \u9733\'26\'05 'Dheepan' (R, 1:49, in French) A former Tamil Tiger militant finds asylum in a French housing project in this film by Jacques Audiard (''Rust and Bone,'' ''A Prophet''), which is both an exercise in topical realism and a tense, western-tinged action drama. (Scott)\par \par \uc2 \u9733\'26\'05 'Don't Blink -- Robert Frank' (No rating, 1:22) An affectionate portrait of this prolific photographer (''The Americans'') and filmmaker (''Pull My Daisy''), still active and irascible in his 90s. (Scott)\par \par \uc2 \u9733\'26\'05 'Don't Think Twice' (R, 1:32) Mike Birbiglia's acutely observed study of a struggling six-member New York improv group that has to come to terms with the ascent of one of its members to television stardom could have been a much nastier movie. But its portraits of disappointed show business hopefuls dreading their expiration dates make no bones about their insecurities, and the ensemble acting is first-rate. (Stephen Holden)\par \par \uc2 \u9733\'26\'05 'Finding Dory' (PG, 1:43) While it lacks the technical dazzle and emotional sweep of ''Finding Nemo'' and other \uc2 Pixar\uc2  masterpieces, this sequel, with Ellen DeGeneres as the voice of an absent-minded blue tang, is a warm, lively and inclusive piece of summer entertainment. Ed O'Neill almost runs away with it as a grumpy, helpful seven-armed octopus named Hank. (Scott)\par \par \uc2 'Ghostbusters' (PG-13, 1:36) Kate McKinnon's magnificent, eccentric turn embodies Paul Feig's reboot at its best. Girls rule; women are funny; get over it. With Leslie Jones, Melissa McCarthy and Kristen Wiig. (Dargis)\par \par \uc2 'Hillary's America: The Secret History of the Democratic Party' (PG-13, 1:40) The conservative author and activist Dinesh D'Souza's cinematic anti-\uc2 Clinton\uc2  broadside has in a sense already been outstripped by current headlines and the conspiracy theories attending them. Thus relegating this movie to the status of an oldies collection, albeit a particularly rabid one. (Glenn Kenny)\par \par \uc2 \u9733\'26\'05 'Hunt for the Wilderpeople' (PG-13, 1:41) In this charming, funny movie about a lost kid and a crusty geezer (a perfect Sam Neill), the New Zealander director Taika Waititi takes some familiar story types and strips them of clich\u233\'00\'E9. (Dargis)\par \par \uc2 'Ice Age: Collision Course' (PG, 1:34) This computer-animated franchise with wisecracking woolly mammoths and a manic squirrel sputters through its latest installment in a particularly uninspired fashion. (Kenny)\par \par \uc2 'Independence Day: Resurgence' (PG-13, 1:59) No. (Dargis)\par \par \uc2 \u9733\'26\'05 'The Infiltrator' (R, 2:07) In some ways, Bryan Cranston's character in ''The Infiltrator'' is an alternate version of Walter White, the good-guy-turned-rotten he portrayed so magnetically in ''Breaking Bad.'' This seedy, drug-soaked thriller is based on a memoir by Robert Mazur (Mr. Cranston), an undercover cop who in 1986 posed as a high-rolling money launderer in a sting operation against Pablo Escobar's Colombian drug cartel. Unlike Walter, Robert is a good guy who remains good when faced with temptation. (Holden)\par \par \uc2 \u9733\'26\'05 'The Innocents' (PG-13, 1:55, in French and Polish) Much of Anne Fontaine's blistering film, set within the walls of a Polish convent in December 1945, just after the end of World War II, is based on true events recalled by a French doctor (Lou de La\u226\'00\'E2ge) stationed at a nearby Red Cross hospital. Summoned to the convent, she discovers pregnant nuns who were serially raped by Soviet soldiers and supervises the deliveries of their babies. Until its too soft ending, ''The Innocents'' is a hair-raising evocation of unspeakable barbarity. (Holden)\par \par \uc2 'The Legend of Tarzan' (PG-13, 1:49) The filmmakers behind this enjoyable romp have given Tarzan (Alexander Skarsgard) a thoughtful, imperfect makeover, which must have been tough, given the origin story's white supremacy problems. Samuel L. Jackson co-stars as a crusader based on a real human rights activist. (Dargis)\par \par \uc2 'Life, Animated' (PG, 1:29) Like the \uc2 Disney\uc2  movie clips that flood its frames, Roger Ross Williams's too-tentative documentary about Owen Suskind, an autistic young man who learned to communicate through cartoon characters, is relentlessly upbeat and frustratingly restrictive. (Catsoulis)\par \par \uc2 'Lights Out' (PG-13, 1:21) Whipping up an eerie blend of haunted-house thriller and supernatural-stalker story, the Swedish director David F. Sandberg extracts maximum frights from the simplest of conceits: an entity that materializes in darkness and vanishes in light. (Catsoulis)\par \par \uc2 \u9733\'26\'05 'The Lobster' (R, 1:59) Colin Farrell and Rachel Weisz star in Yorgos Lanthimos's mordant allegory of managed emotion and mandatory monogamy, set in a chilly, plausibly cruel imaginary world. (Scott)\par \par \uc2 \u9733\'26\'05 'Love & Friendship' (PG, 1:32) Whit Stillman takes a minor Jane Austen work and whips it up into a sharp, silly farce, starring Kate Beckinsale as Lady Susan Vernon, a Regency schemer on the prowl for money and husbands, some of whom already have wives. (Scott)\par \par \uc2 \u9733\'26\'05 'Maggie's Plan' (R, 1:38) \uc2 Rebecca Miller\uc2 's new film is a sharp, genial comedy about Maggie, a young New Yorker (Greta Gerwig) who falls in love and starts a family with an older man (Ethan Hawke), after which things get complicated. Ms. Miller's ear for emotional foibles is acute, and the cast is in good form, in particular Julianne Moore as Maggie's rival, a Danish professor. (Scott)\par \par \uc2 'The Man Who Knew Infinity' (PG-13, 1:48) Dev Patel (the ''Best Exotic Marigold Hotel'' movies) plays yet another earnest, well-meaning character in this portrait of the early-20th-century mathematician Srinivasa Ramanujan, who was mentored by the Cambridge professor G. H. Hardy (Jeremy Irons) and surmounted racism to become the first Indian to hold a fellowship at Trinity College. The film is tidy, handsome and, yes, earnest. (Andy Webster)\par \par \uc2 'Me Before You' (PG-13, 1:51) In this preposterous weepie, Emilia Clarke plays Lou, a quirky free spirit who takes a job caring for Will (Sam Claflin), an imperious quadriplegic aristocrat. If you reread the previous sentence three or four times you will figure out everything that happens in this movie, and spare yourself the chore of seeing it. (Scott)\par \par \uc2 'Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates' (R, 1:45) Two idiots need dates; they get them. (Dargis)\par \par \uc2 'The Neon Demon' (R, 1:57) A derivative, ostentatious quasi-horror movie about an aspiring fashion model (Elle Fanning) and the extreme resentment she engenders. Directed by Nicolas Winding Refn, with his tongue hanging out of his mouth, probably. (Kenny)\par \par \uc2 \u9733\'26\'05 'Norman Lear: Just Another Version of You' (No rating, 1:32) There are lessons about creativity and longevity in this assured documentary portrait by Heidi Ewing and Rachel Grady of Mr. Lear, the influential and socially minded 1970s sitcom producer. In struggles between Mr. Lear and Esther Rolle -- the ''Good Times'' star who took umbrage at the show's tag line, ''Dy-no-mite!'' -- we are reminded that effective topical entertainment rarely comes without conflict. But then, do you know how hard it is ''to make people laugh, to tackle big issues and get big ratings?'' asks Amy Poehler, a Lear admirer. ''It's so hard that people don't do it anymore.'' (Webster)\par \par \uc2 'Phantom Boy' (PG, 1:24) An attractively designed but conceptually and emotionally piddling French animated film from the makers of ''A Cat in Paris'' concerns the adventures of a sickly adolescent New York boy who can travel outside his physical body, the better to observe nefarious criminals and their evil schemes against the city. (Kenny)\par \par \uc2 'The Purge: \uc2 Election\uc2  Year' (R, 1:43) Twelve more hours of unbridled killing from this overachieving low-budget franchise, this time with some interesting, if not terribly well-developed, political overtones. (Scott)\par \par \uc2 'The Secret Life of Pets' (PG, 1:26) From the studio that unleashed the Minions on the world, this talking-animal, celebrity-voiced animated caper falls somewhere in the middle of the spectrum between cat's meow and utter dog. (Scott)\par \par \uc2 'The Shallows' (PG-13, 1:27) A healthy, confident surfer (Blake Lively) treks to an awesome beach in Mexico only to learn that a gigantic and tetchy shark likes to dine there. Chomping, frantic swimming and self-surgery ensue. (Kenny)\par \par \uc2 'Star Trek Beyond' (PG-13, 2:00) Not really ''beyond'' anything, but directed with reasonable flair by Justin Lin and inhabited by the reliably appealing crew of the rebooted Enterprise, with the welcome additions of Idris Elba as the bad guy and Sofia Boutella as a traveler stranded on a remote planet. (Scott)\par \par \uc2 'Summertime' (No rating, 1:45) Catherine Corsini's empathetic, politically astute love story chronicles the relationship between a Parisian literature professor (C\u233\'00\'E9cile de France) and a farmer's daughter (Iz\u239\'00\'EFa Higelin) in the tumult of the early 1970s. (Scott)\par \par \uc2 \u9733\'26\'05 'Train to Busan' (No rating, 1:58) Agile cinematography and hurtling action -- with a side helping of class warfare -- propel Yeon Sang-ho's public-transportation horror movie as elite passengers on a South Korean bullet train face a twitching, hissing threat from the cheap seats. (Catsoulis)\par \par \uc2 'Under the Sun' (No rating, 1:47, in Korean) A startling look at daily life in North Korea, captured by a Russian filmmaker whose finished film turns the tables on the government officials who tried to oversee his work. (Kenny)\par \par \uc2 \u9733\'26\'05 'The Wailing' (No rating, 2:36) The audacious Korean director Na Hong-jin's new movie is an expansive and sometimes excruciating horror tale. Xenophobia and possible demonic possession are among several story ingredients that boil up to a terrifying brew over the movie's two-hour-plus running time. (Kenny)\par \par \uc2 \u9733\'26\'05 'Weiner' (R, 1:40) ''What's wrong with you?'' That question, posed to the disgraced New York City mayoral candidate Anthony Weiner in the infuriating and depressing but rivetingly watchable documentary that bears his name, is never answered and only barely addressed in the film directed by Josh Kriegman (a former Weiner aide) and Elyse Steinberg. As almost everyone knows, Mr. Weiner's meteoric political career was ended -- or at least interrupted -- by a sexting scandal in which Mr. Weiner flirted with and exhibited himself to women online. The movie is also the portrait of a marriage in disarray. His wife, Huma Abedin, a trusted assistant to Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , is present in much of the film, ready to stand by her man but clearly unhappy. (Holden)\par \par \uc2 \u9733\'26\'05 'The Witness' (No rating, 1:29) The 1964 murder of Catherine Genovese, called Kitty, in Queens caused international outrage after a \uc2 New York Times\uc2  front-page article said 38 people had witnessed her murder and failed to act. This seamless documentary traces the yearslong efforts of Ms. Genovese's brother Bill to get to the bottom of what actually happened. Not merely a ''Rashomon''-like account of events, the film is also a compelling portrait of a man striving to come to grips with loss. (Webster)\par \par \uc2 Film Series\par \par \uc2 Les Durs (through Tuesday) France's biggest toughs have been the source of some of Film Forum's biggest box office successes, so it's no surprise that the theater is dedicating a summer series to three actors who specialized in playing gangsters and stoics. The stars in question are Jean Gabin, the poetic leading man of Jean Renoir's ''Grand Illusion''; Lino Ventura, who played a resistance fighter in Jean-Pierre Melville's ''Army of Shadows''; and Jean-Paul Belmondo, who kicked off the program with his turns in Jean-Luc Godard's ''Breathless'' and Melville's wonderfully labyrinthine ''Le Doulos.'' 209 West Houston Street, west of Avenue of the Americas, South Village, 212-727-8110, filmforum.org. (Ben Kenigsberg)\par \par \uc2 Gaumont\uc2 : Cin\u233\'00\'E9ma Pour Tout le Monde (Wednesday through Sept. 7) The \uc2 Gaumont\uc2  studio is one of the great constants of French cinema, as dependable as the Eiffel Tower or steak frites. Although this series celebrates the production company's 120-year history with some favorites from the canon -- including Max Oph\u252\'00\'FCls's ''The Earrings of Madame de ...'' (Saturday and Wednesday) -- it makes room for titles that are relatively disreputable or ripe for reappraisal, such as Joseph Losey's 1982 feature, ''The Trout'' (Aug. 11 and 13), starring a young Isabelle Huppert in a role originally intended for Brigitte Bardot. It also showcases the company's continuing importance with newer films like M\u233\'00\'E9lanie Laurent's 2014 ''Breathe'' (Aug. 17 and 21), a chronicle of a teenage friendship that turns obsessive and suffocating. Museum of Modern Art Roy and Niuta Titus Theaters, 11 West 53rd Street, 212-708-9400, moma.org. (Kenigsberg)\par \par \uc2 'Il Bidone' (Friday through Sunday) Nestled among classics -- it was preceded by ''I Vitelloni'' and ''La Strada'' and followed by ''Nights of Cabiria'' and ''La Dolce Vita'' -- this 1955 feature from Federico Fellini has always seemed like an odd duck in the maestro's output; it adds a touch of film noir fatalism to the sentimentality of his neorealist period. Broderick Crawford and Richard Basehart, both dubbed in Italian, and Franco Fabrizi, from ''I Vitelloni,'' play con men who steal money from the poor, exploiting their targets' desperation and credulity by posing as priests or government housing workers. One warning: Due to a lack of print availability, IFC Center is planning to screen the movie on the substandard Digital Betacam format. At 11 a.m., 323 Avenue of the Americas, at Third Street, Greenwich Village; 212-924-7771, ifccenter.com. (Kenigsberg)\par \par \uc2 Mondo Mondo (through Sunday) This retrospective celebrates the influence of the 1962 ethnographic documentary ''Mondo Cane'' (Saturday), called an antidocumentary or shockumentary by its makers. An opening disclaimer observes that it's not the journalist's job to shy away from cruelty, and the movie's reason for being is to compile bizarre and horrifying sights from around the globe. In the filmmakers' estimation, these include the mating rituals of various South Pacific islanders; birds and turtles on the Marshall Islands whose life cycles have been scrambled by radioactivity; sharks that have grown accustomed to eating human flesh thanks to an underwater cemetery; and a New York City restaurant whose patrons, some coifed like Jacqueline Kennedy, dine on beetles, muskrats and worms. Dog lovers in particular should be warned that they will never be able to un-see what is shown there, but the film remains fascinating for its sensationalism, its possible staging and the sarcastic counterpoint of its voice-over.

(Kenigsberg)\par \par \uc2 Outdoor Cinema 2016 at Socrates Sculpture Park (Wednesdays) In a field trip from its usual Houston Street location, Film Forum has selected six titles to contribute to Socrates Sculpture Park's annual outdoor movie series. (Rooftop Films, which programs outdoor movies across the city, contributed two more.) The selections all have a river theme, an apparent nod to the park's location on the East River. The water in most of the films is probably better for swimming, although Humphrey Bogart does have an encounter with leeches in ''The African Queen,'' which opened the program. Subsequent voyages will take parkgoers to Shanghai (''Suzhou River,'' Aug. 10) and the Amazon region (''Aguirre, the Wrath of God,'' Aug. 17, and the recent Oscar nominee ''Embrace of the Serpent,'' Aug. 24).

The 70mm Show (through Sept. 4) A 70-millimeter film print has a larger image area than a 35-millimeter print, which means it captures more detail; the format has a vibrancy and richness that makes just about any other type of projection seem puny by comparison. In recent years, ''The Master'' and ''The Hateful Eight'' have helped to revive interest in the medium, which is effectively obsolete. This retrospective brings back fat-celluloid favorites like ''2001: A Space Odyssey'' (Friday through Sunday) and ''Hamlet'' (Sept. 2 through 4), both of which show the technology at its most imposing. But some of the other titles are unlikely to come around again for years. These include ''Star!'' (Aug. 27 and 28), \uc2 Robert Wise\uc2  and Julie Andrews's maligned follow-up to ''The Sound of Music''; the Rolling Stones concert film ''Let's Spend the Night Together'' (Aug. 26 and 28); and ''Khartoum'' (Aug. 6 and 7), from 1966, the last feature to use the extra-wide Ultra Panavision 70 format until ''The Hateful Eight'' in 2015.

(through Thursday) Before the introduction of the PG-13 rating in 1984, quite a few movies straddled the line between PG and R -- and many got off with the lighter sentence. The Metrograph's fond look back at this period of permissiveness includes hits like ''Jaws'' (Friday and Tuesday) and ''Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom'' (Saturday, Sunday, Tuesday and Thursday), which was instrumental in the discussion to introduce the intermediate rating. The series also unearths more obscure titles whose PGs now seem baffling, like 1979's ''Tourist Trap'' (Saturday), a crude, heavily ''Psycho''-influenced thriller about a madman who renders his victims into wax mannequins. And for real scares, there is the 1978 version of ''Invasion of the Body Snatchers'' (Monday), which somehow got a legion of mucosal pod people and a naked Brooke Adams past the ratings board.

\par\par \uc2 Politics; SECT\par \b \uc2 Russia, Suspected in Hacking, Has Uneasy History With \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\b0\par\par\uc2 By MARK LANDLER \par \uc2 1,192 \uc2 words\par \uc2 29 July 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 The New York Times on the Web\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 PHILADELPHIA -- Follow along with our coverage of the Democratic National Convention.\par \par \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's apparent endorsement on Wednesday of Russian cyberspying against \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  has pulled President \uc2 Vladimir V. Putin\uc2  fully into the American political fray. But Mr. Putin's relationship with Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  has been tense at least since 2011, when, as secretary of state, she accused him of rigging an \uc2 election\uc2  and he accused her of meddling in Russian politics.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Putin -- who was then the prime minister, plotting his return to the presidency -- said her words were a ''signal'' to protesters, encouraging them to take to the streets, which they did in large numbers. Her remarks also annoyed the White House, which at that time still clung to the hope that President Obama's policy of ''resetting'' relations with Russia could be salvaged.\par \par \uc2 That episode, late in Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's tenure as secretary of state, is important to understanding why Mr. Putin's government could have a motive for hacking into the \uc2 Democratic National Committee\uc2 's computers and leaking emails to damage her electoral prospects against Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 But it also speaks to the hard-line stance toward Russia and Mr. Putin that Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  staked out in the Obama administration. At the same time that she was condemning Russia over its elections, Mr. Obama's national security adviser, \uc2 Tom Donilon\uc2 , was planning to travel to Moscow to meet Mr. Putin; her harsh words complicated his diplomacy.\par \par \uc2 Above all, the bitter exchange attests to a combustible relationship between two ambitious, self-confident leaders, both unafraid to exercise power -- one a former K.G.B. officer who emerged from the shadows; the other a famous female politician who spent decades on the public stage.\par \par \uc2 ''In our administration, Secretary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  always had a tougher line toward Putin and the Russians than other senior administration officials,'' said Michael A. McFaul, an adviser on Russia who served as United States ambassador to Moscow. ''It was Putin's strong belief that we, with \uc2 Clinton\uc2  in the lead, were trying to meddle with his regime.''\par \par \uc2 It was one of several instances where Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  was more hawkish than her boss -- differences the White House and the \uc2 Clinton\uc2  campaign have so far played down but which may loom larger in the general \uc2 election\uc2 . Certainly, Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  has been open in saying she would push back harder than Mr. Obama has against Mr. Putin's aggression in Ukraine and Syria.\par \par \uc2 Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's first meeting with Mr. Putin as secretary of state set the stage for a stormy relationship. When she went to see him in his dacha outside Moscow on March 19, 2010, he kept her waiting in front of a ceramic mantelpiece, facing a forest of cameras and boom microphones.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Putin finally turned up for what was billed as a brief photo opportunity, only to lecture her in front of the reporters about how the United States needed to lift sanctions against American companies doing business in Iran. And when Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  started to defend the Obama administration's policy, he promptly ordered the news media out of the room.\par \par \uc2 Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  laughed off the episode, telling reporters what has become an oft-repeated story about their relationship. ''Prime Minister Putin,'' she recalled asking him amid his harangue about trade policy, ''tell me about what you're doing to save the tigers in Siberia.''\par \par \uc2 Eyes brightening, Mr. Putin motioned her to his private office downstairs, where he showed her a map of Russia. Pointing to various regions, he delivered a fervent lecture about endangered tigers and polar bears. He asked her whether \uc2 Bill \uc2 Clinton\uc2  would go on a bear-tagging expedition with him in Siberia. If Bill was not available, he said, maybe Hillary would go?\par \par \uc2 Diplomats traveling with her were impressed. ''It's like he sizes somebody up and sees them as a worthy adversary or counterpart,'' said William J. Burns, a former ambassador to Moscow who served as Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's deputy at the State Department. ''I've seen him with other people who he didn't see that way, and he'd be much more dismissive and snarky.''\par \par \uc2 In retrospect, though, the meeting planted the seeds for future tensions. Eight months later, Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  canceled her attendance at a meeting he organized in St. Petersburg to save the tigers. Her excuse was that she had to stay in Washington to lobby the Senate to ratify a new arms reduction treaty.\par \par \uc2 A year later, Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  was traveling in Lithuania when reports of ballot tampering and other fraud emerged after parliamentary elections in Russia. ''The Russian people, like people everywhere, deserve the right to have their voices heard and their votes counted,'' she said in a statement, drafted by her spokeswoman, Victoria J. Nuland, a career diplomat and Soviet expert known for her sharp-edged views about Russia.\par \par \uc2 ''Putin was livid that she had spoken out,'' Mr. McFaul said.\par \par \uc2 High-ranking Russian officials even called the White House to ask whether she was speaking for the United States. That created a tempest in the West Wing, since Mr. McFaul had signed off on Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's statement. Although the president was also skeptical of Mr. Putin's intentions, he, too, had hoped to keep the reset policy alive a little longer.\par \par \uc2 There was no evidence that Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  had any regrets. Shortly before she left the State Department, she asked her top policy aide, Jake Sullivan, to draft a three-and-a-half-page exit memo from her to Mr. Obama, warning him that the reset policy was dead, that relations with Russia would deteriorate under Mr. Putin and that the United States needed to push back hard.\par \par \uc2 Advisers to Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  said they were confident she would pursue such a strategy as president. Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's latest comments -- in which he said he hoped Russia would find and expose thousands of emails that Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  did not hand over to the State Department -- only highlighted the chasm between their positions, according to these aides.\par \par \uc2 ''What \uc2 Trump\uc2  said today is reckless and demonstrates he is unfit for the Oval Office,'' said \uc2 R. Nicholas Burns\uc2 , a former top State Department official and foreign-policy adviser to Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 . He said that he was confident that Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  would strongly defend the interests of the United States and its allies against any aggression by Mr. Putin.\par \par \uc2 By 2014, after Russia had annexed Crimea and sent its tanks and troops to menace Ukraine, Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's exit memo to the president looked prescient. Speaking at a Democratic fund-raiser in California in March 2014, she likened Mr. Putin's behavior to Hitler's conquest of the Sudetenland in 1938.\par \par \uc2 When Mr. Putin was asked about that comparison by a French television station three months later, he replied: ''It's better not to argue with women. Ms. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  had never been too graceful in her statements.''\par \par \uc2 Find out what you need to know about the 2016 presidential race today, and get politics news updates via \uc2 Facebook\uc2 , \uc2 Twitter\uc2  and the First Draft newsletter.\par \par \uc2 Document NYTF000020160729ec7t0006h\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 Metropolitan Desk; SECT\par \b \uc2 A Torrent of Praise for Mario Cuomo's 1984 Democratic Convention Speech\b0\par\par\uc2 By JESSE McKINLEY \par \uc2 1,000 \uc2 words\par \uc2 29 July 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 The New York Times on the Web\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 After \uc2 Mario M. Cuomo\uc2 , then the governor of New York, delivered his ''Tale of Two Cities'' keynote address during the 1984 Democratic National Convention in San Francisco, he received a torrent of praise from across the country and predictions of presidential ambitions.\par \par \uc2 But that was not meant to be -- Mr. Cuomo, who died in 2015, never ran for higher office.\par \par \uc2 Echoes of the famed speech, however, may be evident on Thursday when Mr. Cuomo's son \uc2 Andrew M. Cuomo\uc2 , the current governor of New York, is expected to take the stage of the convention in Philadelphia to stump for \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Whether the governor will reference Mario Cuomo in his speech remains to be seen, but whatever themes he employs, one thing is clear: His father is a tough act to follow.\par \par \uc2 Indeed, a search of the state archives in Albany revealed hundreds of letters to the elder Mr. Cuomo after his 1984 speech, lauding his intellect, passion and precise diagnosis of the nation's ills. And, of course, they showcased some Queens bragging rights.\par \par \uc2 Among those who sent notes to the governor's office in the days and months after his rousing call to -arms were a football coach, an animal lover and a drama critic. A sampling of their letters:\par \par \uc2 A Queens Transplant\par \par \uc2 The year 1984 was big for the borough of Queens. Aside from Mr. Cuomo, a lawyer from the Hollis neighborhood who rose to become the most powerful man in the state, another Queens notable, Representative Geraldine Ferraro, was the first woman to be nominated for vice president by a major party when she was chosen as Walter Mondale's running mate on the Democratic ticket. (It was also not to be, of course, in a landslide \uc2 election\uc2  year for Republicans.) Still, Janice Rugoff, a Queens transplant living in Southern California, wrote to the governor to express some hometown pride over his ''vital and moving keynote speech.''\par \par \uc2 ''If we had buttons,'' Ms. Rugoff wrote, ''we would have burst them!''\par \par \uc2 A Texas Democrat\par \par \uc2 Mr. Cuomo's letters of support came from across the country, even from such seemingly solid Republican strongholds as Texas. (Ronald Reagan went on to win that state, with more than 60 percent of the vote.) E. Deloris Hairgrove-Brown, a Baptist from Pasadena, Tex., was a Democrat -- ''from a very old and political family,'' she noted -- who was deeply impressed by the New York governor. She likened him to President John F. Kennedy, though she hoped Mr. Cuomo's personal life would ''not be chronicled with the same repose as JFK.'' She wrote that she would ''pray daily'' for Mr. Cuomo if he ran for president, and asked him to send her a signed photograph. ''Please inscribe it, 'To Dee, my fellow Democrat,''' she wrote.\par \par \uc2 A Student From Brooklyn\par \par \uc2 Mr. Cuomo's speech inspired Carolyn Torres, a 17-year-old junior at St. Joseph High School in Brooklyn and an aspiring politician, to send a letter praising the governor for his energy and his stand on issues. ''Not to many people my age stayed home to watch the D. Convention,'' she wrote. ''Some thought I was Crazy. Its been worth it.'' Ms. Torres went on to praise politics in general -- ''I love to discuss, I love to debate, I love the personal sides of politics'' -- before inviting the governor to visit her school and promising to support him once she was old enough to vote. ''As a young person of today, I think we are the future,'' she wrote. ''You worked and you are making a difference. I think that's what all young people have to hear.''\par \par \uc2 An Animal Lover From Pennsylvania\par \par \uc2 Days after the \uc2 election\uc2 , some were already hoping that Mr. Cuomo would take up the mantle of the shattered and shellacked Democratic Party. Among those was Gertrude Brenkosh, of Wilkes-Barre, Pa., who identified herself as a 64-year-old animal lover with a few complaints about the \uc2 election\uc2  night coverage. ''No way should the news media keep projecting the \uc2 election\uc2 '' until the voting is complete, Ms. Brenkosh wrote. ''It is actually telling people how to vote.'' But Ms. Brenkosh seemed more of a Cuomo fan than a media critic. ''You are a good man,'' she wrote. ''And if you run for president you have my vote.''\par \par \uc2 A Football Coach\par \par \uc2 The New Jersey Generals football team, of the defunct United States Football League, is a name that has resurfaced in this year's presidential campaign; it was owned by \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2 . In 1984, their head coach was Walt Michaels, a former head coach of the New York Jets, who had just led the Generals to their best year ever. ''Magnificent keynote address!'' Mr. Michaels wrote just days after the San Francisco speech. ''Those of us who know you were never in doubt. Now the entire nation is aware.''\par \par \uc2 A Drama Critic\par \par \uc2 Jerry Tallmer, a longtime and well-respected drama critic who died in 2014, wrote in personal and poetic terms about the impact of the governor's speech. He began with a memory of listening to a radio speech -- ''on a bed in a summer shanty on Fire Island, hot, dozing'' -- by Adlai Stevenson, the Democratic presidential nominee in 1952 and 1956. ''It cut through mud, and through me, like a knife,'' Mr. Tallmer wrote. He went on to say that Mr. Cuomo's address had affected him similarly. ''I watched, listened, shaking sometimes,'' Mr. Tallmer wrote on stationery from The New York Post, his employer. ''It was so tough. So angry. So right.'' (The word ''right'' is underlined twice.) He added that his 23-year-old son called it ''the best speech he'd ever heard in his life.''\par \par \uc2 ''I'm sure it was,'' Mr. Tallmer concluded. ''Thank you.''\par \par \uc2 Follow The \uc2 New York Times\uc2 's Metro coverage on \uc2 Facebook\uc2  and \uc2 Twitter\uc2 , and sign up for the New York Today newsletter.\par \par \uc2 Document NYTF000020160729ec7t00060\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 National Desk; SECTA\par \b \uc2 Candidates Set to Get Intelligence Briefings as Each Questions the Other's Trustworthiness\b0\par\par\uc2 By MARK MAZZETTI \par \uc2 839 \uc2 words\par \uc2 29 July 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 14\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 WASHINGTON -- \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2  and \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  have each described the other as unfit to be trusted with classified information. But as is customary for the official nominees of both parties, the two candidates will get their first intelligence briefings as early as next week.\par \par \uc2 American intelligence officials will soon contact the two campaigns to schedule a wide-ranging briefing for each on global conflicts, the status of America's military campaigns overseas and the latest maneuverings by foreign governments, both friend and foe.\par \par \uc2 This quadrennial rite of passage for presidential candidates usually takes place while few people pay attention. Not now. Recent statements on the campaign trail, and barbed accusations by both candidates about their opponent's ability to handle classified information, have focused attention on the intelligence briefings and raised questions about how much, or how little, the spies will share with the candidates.\par \par \uc2 The subject came up again on Wednesday after Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's comments at a news conference, where he said he hoped the Russians had hacked Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's computer server and then encouraged them to publish whatever they had stolen. This drew outrage from current and former government officials, both Republicans and Democrats, who said a presidential candidate had for the first time invited a foreign power to carry out espionage on American soil. Some former senior intelligence officials said Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's comments bordered on treason.\par \par \uc2 For his part, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  said that Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's decision to set up a private email server during the time she was secretary of state meant she could not be trusted to receive classified briefings. ''Now why are they giving her briefings? Why are these people with great knowledge of the inner workings of our country and our security, why are they giving \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  briefings?'' Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  asked. ''Because it's going to get revealed.''\par \par \uc2 The Office of the Director of National Intelligence coordinates the briefings that the candidates will receive, and they will be conducted by intelligence briefers who will meet each candidate on the campaign trail, at a nearby F.B.I. field office or other secure government facility.\par \par \uc2 The information given to the candidates hardly amounts to the crown jewels of American intelligence. Current and former government officials said the briefings were broad overviews of how American spy agencies see the state of the world, similar to the briefing that James R. Clapper Jr., the director of national intelligence, gives to Congress each year. The briefings will contain top secret information, but the candidates are given no information about covert action programs or the identities of intelligence sources.\par \par \uc2 During an appearance on Thursday at the Aspen Security Forum, Mr. Clapper said that the three most significant topics for the candidate briefings would be the threat of cyberattacks, the Islamic State and Russia.\par \par \uc2 This year, Mr. Clapper said that career intelligence officers would conduct the briefings, and that neither he nor any other political appointee would attend.\par \par \uc2 ''As a legal matter, the president can tell the nominees as much or as little as he believes is necessary or prudent,'' said Susan Hennessey of the \uc2 Brookings Institution\uc2 , adding that President Obama had indicated that he would allow intelligence officials to make the determination about what information Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  and Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  will receive.\par \par \uc2 ''With all forms of sharing classified information, there is a strong tendency to err on the side of caution,'' she said.\par \par \uc2 Shortly after the November \uc2 election\uc2 , the president-elect will receive a more detailed set of intelligence briefings.\par \par \uc2 The practice of giving intelligence briefings to presidential candidates dates back to the Truman administration, but not the politics surrounding them.\par \par \uc2 On Wednesday night at the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia, Democrats weighed in. ''\uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2 , who wants to be president of the United States, is asking one of our adversaries to engage in hacking or intelligence efforts against the United States of America to affect an \uc2 election\uc2 ,'' Leon E. Panetta, who served as C.I.A. director and secretary of defense under Mr. Obama, told the delegates.\par \par \uc2 Senator Harry Reid, the Senate minority leader, had a proposal for American spy agencies planning to meet with Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 ''I would suggest to the intelligence agencies: If you're forced to brief this guy, don't tell him anything, just fake it, because this man is dangerous,'' Mr. Reid, a Nevada Democrat, said in an interview Wednesday with The Huffington Post. ''Fake it, pretend you're doing a briefing, but you can't give the guy any information.''\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's position is that he is already schooled in national security issues, like how to defeat the Islamic State. ''I know more about ISIS than the generals do, believe me,'' Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  said in Iowa in November.\par \par \uc2 James R. Clapper Jr., the director of national intelligence, in February at a Senate Armed Services Committee hearing.

\par\par \uc2 Politics; SECT\par \b \uc2 Democratic Convention Day 4 Takeaways: Over? She's Just Starting\b0\par\par\uc2 By MATT FLEGENHEIMER \par \uc2 771 \uc2 words\par \uc2 29 July 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 The New York Times on the Web\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 PHILADELPHIA -- \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  stepped into history. Her daughter, Chelsea, lent a hand. And supporters of Bernie Sanders packed up their signs, some of his admirers still unmoved by Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  as the clock ran out on the Democratic National Convention. Here are our takeaways from the convention's last night:\par \par \uc2 She's been around. And maybe that's O.K.\par \par \uc2 Bill \uc2 Clinton\uc2  took pains this week to cast his wife as a ''change maker.'' You will not hear Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  object.\par \par \uc2 But under the brightest spotlight of an \uc2 election\uc2  brimming with outsider fervor -- powering \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2  to the Republican nomination and Mr. Sanders to unexpected success -- Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  presented herself as something different. She is a creature of the system and unapologetic about her r\u233\'00\'E9sum\u233\'00\'E9.\par \par \uc2 ''Sometimes the people at this podium are new to the national stage,'' she said, preparing to tick off her many titles. ''I am not one of those people.''\par \par \uc2 It is a gambit premised in part on her atypical Republican opponent -- and a hope that promises of incremental change might sound more palatable when the alternative is viewed as truly dangerous.\par \par \uc2 ''I sweat the details,'' Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  said. Voters might not. But she is betting, at least, that they think someone should.\par \par \uc2 She is not done courting Sanders voters.\par \par \uc2 Demonstrations inside and outside the convention hall this week made clear that Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  had some work to do to persuade at least some die-hard supporters of Mr. Sanders.\par \par \uc2 On Thursday, she seemed to acknowledge as much, quickly addressing them directly with a simple message: I hear you.\par \par \uc2 ''Your cause is our cause,'' she said, thanking Mr. Sanders for placing issues of economic and social justice ''front and center, where they belong.''\par \par \uc2 Total unity has been elusive, and could remain so. As Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  accepted the nomination, some Sanders delegates stood stone-faced, occasionally booing or silently protesting.\par \par \uc2 Democrats will keep talking about \uc2 Trump\uc2 's proposed Muslim ban.\par \par \uc2 During the Republican primary race, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's proposed ban on Muslim immigration appeared to do nothing but help at the polls, even as rivals objected with varying degrees of outrage.\par \par \uc2 Democrats appear convinced they can win the argument among the wider electorate. And they may have found their most potent voice: Khizr Khan, an American Muslim whose son, Humayun S. M. Khan, was killed in Iraq.\par \par \uc2 In a stirring address, his stoicism building to a controlled simmer, Mr. Khan challenged Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  on behalf of ''patriotic American Muslims'' everywhere. ''You have sacrificed nothing,'' Mr. Khan said, his wife standing silently beside him, ''and no one.''\par \par \uc2 For organizers, the choice to showcase Mr. Khan amounted to a pointed dare: Are these people not American enough for you, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 ?\par \par \uc2 There's another 'law and order' franchise.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  has presented himself as something of a one-man anti-crime plan, arguing that he is the lone force standing between the United States and semi-lawless dystopia. Republican leaders have accused Democrats of giving terrorism issues short shrift in Philadelphia.\par \par \uc2 But as Thursday's slate made clear, Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's team believes that Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , with his scattershot defense policies and often erratic statements, has supplied an opportunity. For much of the evening, matters of public safety took center stage, with testimony from a retired Marine general -- to chants of ''U.S.A.!'' -- a Texas sheriff and the relatives of fallen officers.\par \par \uc2 It was consistent with a theme of the week: No presumed Republican motif -- from an emphasis on national defense to conspicuous invocations of faith to warm quotations of Ronald Reagan -- is safe from Democratic encroachment in the age of \uc2 Trump\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 About that glass ceiling ...\par \par \uc2 In her presidential runs, Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  has at times struggled with how, and how often, to highlight her gender. No more.\par \par \uc2 First \uc2 Chelsea \uc2 Clinton\uc2  paid tribute to her maternal compassion, saying that Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's own mother would be proud.\par \par \uc2 Then Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , calling herself ''my mother's daughter and my daughter's mother,'' stopped to cheer her nomination as ''a milestone in our nation's march toward a more perfect union.''\par \par \uc2 There is a risk in turning off male voters, with whom she has fared poorly in surveys. Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  argued explicitly that they, too, had a stake in her success, whether or not they recognized it. ''When any barrier falls in America,'' she said, ''it clears the way for everyone.''\par \par \uc2 Find out what you need to know about the 2016 presidential race today, and get politics news updates via \uc2 Facebook\uc2 , \uc2 Twitter\uc2  and the First Draft newsletter.\par \par \uc2 Document NYTF000020160729ec7t0004d\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 Politics; SECT\par \b \uc2 Soundtrack for a Convention Week: Alicia Keys, Paul Simon and Many Others\b0\par\par\uc2 By NICK CORASANITI \par \uc2 730 \uc2 words\par \uc2 29 July 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 The New York Times on the Web\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Demi Lovato, Alicia Keys, Paul Simon, \uc2 Snoop Dogg\uc2 , The Black Eyed Peas, Joe Walsh and Lenny Kravitz.\par \par \uc2 These aren't the headlining acts of the next big summer music festival. They're just a few of the many big artists performing on the convention stage and in concert halls around Philadelphia during the four-day Democratic National Convention.\par \par \uc2 Inside the Wells Fargo Center, elaborate performances and musical interludes have been woven into the prime-time schedule. Mr. Simon sang ''Bridge Over Troubled Water'' in the lead-up to Senator Bernie Sanders's address on Monday night, and Lenny Kravitz sang ''Let Love Rule'' before Senator Tim Kaine and President Obama took the stage on Wednesday.\par \par \uc2 ''They're so deeply interested in bringing artists and entertainers together to conventions and political events because they've come to realize over time that they need to get the people that the people in this country are listening to,'' said Jon Rubin, the chairman of \uc2 Rock the Vote\uc2 . ''There's a lot of things to listen to other than politicians that are a lot more compelling.''\par \par \uc2 Mr. Rubin's group was one of many that organized and hosted concerts around the city this week to capitalize on the focus on the \uc2 election\uc2  and highlight issues, while providing a party as well.\par \par \uc2 ''If you're voting this year, put your cellphone or your lighter in the air,'' shouted Dre Sinatra, a D.J. who backs the artist Ty Dolla Sign, at the \uc2 Rock the Vote\uc2  show on Wednesday night at the Fillmore. ''We came here for something positive, right?''\par \par \uc2 The event also featured a performance by the Black Eyed Peas, whose set stretched into the early morning on Thursday. HeadCount, an organization devoted to signing people up to vote, also hosted a concert this week, with Grace Potter playing at the Electric Factory until last call.\par \par \uc2 ''There are so many issues that entertainers, artists, activists, we're all fighting for,'' said Luis Calderin, the vice president for marketing and creative at \uc2 Rock the Vote\uc2 , ''that the lines of an activist versus a musician are kind of gone. You look at someone like Beyonc\u233\'00\'E9, and she is as much of a member of Black Lives Matter as Erica Garner.''\par \par \uc2 At the convention on Monday, Ms. Lovato addressed mental health issues before singing her hit ''Confident.'' Ms. Keys spoke about gun violence before serenading the audience with ''Superwoman.'' And Andra Day sang ''Rise Up'' after speeches by the Mothers of the Movement, a group of black women who have lost children in clashes with the police or in gun violence.\par \par \uc2 ''Until we deal with gun violence in this country, we can't claim 'home of the brave,''' Ms. Keys proclaimed, vamping softly on piano chords before diving into the opening lyrics of ''Superwoman.''\par \par \uc2 Not all convention guests, delegates and local residents can get tickets for every show; some events are open only to a specific guest list, as a thank you for supporting an industry or cause -- and to encourage further engagement.\par \par \uc2 On Monday night, Joe Walsh and Jason Isbell ripped through solos for those invited to an event hosted by the Distilled Spirits Council. Nelly and D.J. Jazzy Jeff performed at the \uc2 Recording Industry Association of America\uc2  concert. And on Thursday, \uc2 Snoop Dogg\uc2  is to play at a concert hosted by Priorities USA and other groups supporting \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 . Lady Gaga and Mr. Kravitz will play a show across the river in Camden, N.J., for delegates and invited guests.\par \par \uc2 The concerts may have all centered on one side of the political aisle, but many artists and organizers also see their performances as a buffer and a salve to the growing polarization in the country.\par \par \uc2 ''Music is the universal language, it definitely brings people together,'' said Aloe Blacc, a singer who gave multiple performances throughout the week. ''Music is kind of the last playground. If you think of how raceless and classless a playground is, how children just play together in a sandbox without any kind of sense of difference, that's what music is. It's the adult's last playground.''\par \par \uc2 Find out what you need to know about the 2016 presidential race today, and get politics news updates via \uc2 Facebook\uc2 , \uc2 Twitter\uc2  and the First Draft newsletter.\par \par \uc2 Document NYTF000020160729ec7t0003y\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 NEWS ANALYSIS\par \uc2 National Desk; SECTA\par \b \uc2 Asking the Public to Set Doubts Aside and Put Faith in Competence\b0\par\par\uc2 By MICHAEL BARBARO; Amy Chozick contributed reporting. \par \uc2 1,281 \uc2 words\par \uc2 29 July 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 13\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 PHILADELPHIA -- The trust of the American electorate remains out of her reach. Its affections still elude her.\par \par \uc2 So after decades in public life, \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  grasped for something less lofty and far more attainable here on Thursday night: an unquestioned acknowledgment of her readiness for the job.\par \par \uc2 The most consequential speech of her campaign, and of her career, seemed to contain an unspoken concession: By now it is all but impossible for Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  to shake herself loose from the elaborate, decades-old scaffold of assumptions -- built up by scandal and bolted in place by her enemies -- that her motives are impure.\par \par \uc2 But it offered a firm and extensive counterargument: A succession of senior government positions, deep dives in the intricacies of policy and high-stakes international negotiations have prepared her for the presidency in ways that \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2  cannot possibly match.\par \par \uc2 ''It's true,'' she said, proudly embracing her reputation for jargon-laden 10-point plans and dog-eared briefing books. ''I sweat the details of policy.''\par \par \uc2 ''Because it's not just a detail if it's your kid -- if it's your family. It's a big deal. And it should be a big deal to your president.''\par \par \uc2 Besieged by lingering doubts about her honesty, Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  made the case for a different kind of trust onstage in Philadelphia: not the textbook definition, but a more pragmatic faith in her judgment, experience, temperament and priorities.\par \par \uc2 She asked voters to trust her instincts, reciting an old saying she learned in the Methodist Church.\par \par \uc2 ''Do all the good you can, for all the people you can, in all the ways you can, as long as ever you can,'' she said.\par \par \uc2 She asked them to trust in her compassion. ''To drive real progress, you have to change both hearts and laws,'' she said. ''You need both understanding and action.'' She asked them to trust in her own resilience. ''More than a few times, I've had to pick myself up and get back in the game.''\par \par \uc2 It was a speech that embraced her undeniable strengths in a topsy-turvy campaign against a wily and unpredictable rival: She had the thick skin and pressure-tested personality to be commander in chief. Her opponent, she said over and over, did not.\par \par \uc2 ''\uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  can't even handle the rough-and-tumble of a presidential campaign,'' Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  said. ''He loses his cool at the slightest provocation.''\par \par \uc2 That message of maturity, Democratic and Republican campaign operatives said, could prove decisive.\par \par \uc2 ''For those voters on the bubble,'' said David Axelrod, a former strategist and adviser to President Obama, ''I think that is a tiebreaker in this \uc2 election\uc2 .''\par \par \uc2 But in a conspicuous absence, Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  chose not to touch on her biggest vulnerability: the belief, widely held by voters, that she is a calculating and dishonest figure.\par \par \uc2 Even her closest allies acknowledge is a perilous reputation she may never dispel. ''It's a tricky piece of business, how she addresses this,'' Mr. Axelrod said. ''There is no set of words that can entirely resolve these issues.''\par \par \uc2 Poll after poll shows that a startlingly wide cross-section of voters simply do not trust her: 67 percent of registered voters in a New York Times/CBS News poll this month, many of them wary of her inconsistent explanations for using a private email server when she was secretary of state.\par \par \uc2 So Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  is asking for trust of a different kind.\par \par \uc2 The strategy rests on the proposition that voters are capable, in the words of Stuart Stevens, a longtime Republican strategist, ''of holding contradictory thoughts in balance.''\par \par \uc2 ''With her, you can have real doubts about her, but you can still trust her to be a president,'' he said.\par \par \uc2 A persuasive role model: her husband.\par \par \uc2 Bill \uc2 Clinton\uc2  successfully confronted a similar dilemma in 1992, when he asked voters to distinguish breaches of trust in his personal life from the faith he asked them to place in him as their next president. Trust in my vision for the country, he said, no matter what you think of my marital infidelity.\par \par \uc2 At his convention 24 years ago, Mr. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  faced down his damaged reputation with striking directness, quoting a young voter who had approached him at a campaign event and bluntly asked him, ''Why should I trust you?''\par \par \uc2 His response then was much like his wife's is today: to persuade voters that he could be trusted, above all, to battle tirelessly on their behalf.\par \par \uc2 On Thursday, Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  vowed to be a champion of the overlooked and overworked. ''I will carry all of your voices and stories with me to the White House,'' she said, in an echo of her husband's famously empathetic style.\par \par \uc2 ''What the campaign wants,'' said Paul Begala, Mr. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's chief strategist in 1992, ''is for people to move away from this position that she is fundamentally dishonest, to 'She made a mistake there, but I trust her to fight for me.' ''\par \par \uc2 Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  had ample help in Philadelphia. Throughout the Democratic convention, a procession of big-name speakers reached, one by one, for ways to attest to her trustworthiness, often in highly personal terms, and beseeched voters who are skeptical of Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  to take them at their word.\par \par \uc2 Michelle Obama\uc2  vouched for her as a mother of two young women. ''I trust \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  to lead this country,'' Mrs. Obama said, ''because I've seen her lifelong devotion to our nation's children, not just her own daughter, who she has raised to perfection.''\par \par \uc2 Senator Tim Kaine, Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's running mate, testified as the father of a Marine. ''I trust \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  with our son's life,'' he said.\par \par \uc2 And a retired general, \uc2 John Allen\uc2 , stood up for her as a former commander of United States military forces in Afghanistan. ''We trust in her judgment,'' he said on Thursday night, surrounded by fellow generals, admirals and veterans. ''We know that she, as no other, knows how to use all instruments of American power, not just the military, to keep us all safe and free.''\par \par \uc2 The message was not subtle. And that was deliberate.\par \par \uc2 John D. Podesta, the chairman of Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's campaign, said in an interview that the aim was to portray her as someone who, when politics gives way to the serious business of governing, can be counted on. ''A person who, when the doors close and the cameras are off, people trust,'' he said.\par \par \uc2 For most presidential candidates, trust is not a flaw to be fixed, but a quality to exploit or a rhetorical device to deploy.\par \par \uc2 For George W. Bush, who lacked gravitas and a deep r\u233\'00\'E9sum\u233\'00\'E9 when he sought the presidency, it was a way to recast inexperience as humility. ''If you give me your trust,'' he said at his convention in 2000, ''I will honor it.''\par \par \uc2 For \uc2 Mitt Romney\uc2 , whose vast wealth and business tactics risked alienating voters, it was a chance to see him in a new, less menacing light. He was, he told his convention in 2012, ''deeply moved by the trust you have placed in me.''\par \par \uc2 Those men asked the country to trust in them -- just as Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  has urged voters to trust him alone to fix what ails the nation.\par \par \uc2 On Thursday night, Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  rejected that argument, promising, ''We will fix it together.''\par \par \uc2 Her message: Do not trust her alone. Trust ''us.''\par \par \uc2 Find out what you need to know about the 2016 presidential race today, and get politics news updates via \uc2 Facebook\uc2 , \uc2 Twitter\uc2  and the First Draft newsletter.\par \par \uc2 Document NYTF000020160729ec7t00039\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 ABOUT NEW YORK\par \uc2 Metropolitan Desk; SECTA\par \b \uc2 Another Ex-Mayor Takes the Stage, but This Time, to Ease an Anxious Nation\b0\par\par\uc2 By JIM DWYER \par \uc2 853 \uc2 words\par \uc2 29 July 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 18\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 In a few words he wrote just before going onstage on Wednesday night, \uc2 Michael R. Bloomberg\uc2  made a simple, arctic crack about \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's mental health at the Democratic National Convention.\par \par \uc2 It's not just candidates: The political campaign this year is driving voters crazy.\par \par \uc2 A friend who is a psychiatrist recently told me that he was seeing the emergence of a new disorder: patients gripped with worry that Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , the Republican nominee, will become president.\par \par \uc2 I thought the doctor couldn't be serious.\par \par \uc2 Or was he?\par \par \uc2 ''At least two sessions a day, I'm listening to people who are in despair that \uc2 Trump\uc2  might win,'' the psychiatrist said. ''They are really consumed by worry about it.''\par \par \uc2 He asked that he not be identified, explaining that he was worried about trolling by fringe elements: ''I don't need a bunch of white supremacists clogging up my phone line, even if it's just to gloat. (Put that in the story too.)''\par \par \uc2 Now, these episodes of what appears to be \uc2 Trump\uc2  Anxiety Disorder are the experiences of one doctor who practices in Manhattan. If we have learned nothing else from Woody Allen movies, it is that inhabitants of the borough have a highly evolved ability to find things to worry about, like dogs who can turn a smelly sneaker or a Christian Louboutin stiletto into a chew toy.\par \par \uc2 Over the past two weeks, two former New York mayors, Mr. Bloomberg and \uc2 Rudolph W. Giuliani\uc2 , each spoke in featured spots at one of the political conventions. (The current mayor, \uc2 Bill de Blasio\uc2 , also had a turn at the Democratic convention, though it was during a prolonged lull in the proceedings.)\par \par \uc2 The talks by both former mayors were like mood-altering drugs. Mr. Giuliani's speech was a triple-dose of the amphetamine Adderall. At the Republican National Convention, he gave a nostril-flaring, fire-breathing warning of a pending apocalypse and said Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  was the only person capable of bringing about salvation.\par \par \uc2 In a long line of New York street-corner prophets preaching of impending doom, Mr. Giuliani spoke about a world on the edge of an abyss: ''There's, there's, there's no next \uc2 election\uc2 . This is it. There's no more time for us left to revive our great country.''\par \par \uc2 Mr. Bloomberg's speech, on the other hand, was a beta-blocker, a class of drugs often administered to calm people suffering from anxiety. This was his second appearance at a political convention. In 2004, when the Republican convention was held in the city, Mr. Bloomberg as mayor served as chairman of the host committee. ''The president deserves our support,'' he had said of George W. Bush, then seeking a second term. ''We are here to support him.''\par \par \uc2 Since then, Mr. Bloomberg has declared himself an independent, a member of no political party, and flirted with the idea of running for president. About three weeks ago, the campaign of \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  asked if he might give a speech endorsing her, \uc2 Kevin Sheekey\uc2 , an adviser to Mr. Bloomberg, said.\par \par \uc2 In his second convention speech -- this time for a Democratic candidate -- Mr. Bloomberg would be able to speak, Mr. Sheekey said, to about 18 percent of the country who is unsure whether to vote for either Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  or Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 . In his remarks, he would endorse her but specifically take issue with positions held by the Democrats.\par \par \uc2 ''This was not an address written for people in the room,'' Mr. Sheekey said. ''Ahead of it, we talked about speaking through the boos, and not losing your rhythm.''\par \par \uc2 In his prepared remarks, Mr. Bloomberg -- who made his own fortune -- ripped apart Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  as a businessman who had been given a $1 million stake from his father and still managed to leave a trail of bankruptcies, lawsuits, and small-business owners and employees who felt they had been cheated. ''I'm a New Yorker, and I know a con when I see one,'' the former mayor said.\par \par \uc2 (While Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  is a species of New Yorker, he usually files for bankruptcy outside the city. Only one of the six bankruptcies associated with his businesses, his belly flop on the Plaza Hotel, was heard in a Manhattan court.)\par \par \uc2 On Wednesday evening, Mr. Bloomberg rehearsed that speech, went back to his hotel to shower and change, then returned to the convention about 90 minutes ahead of his scheduled slot. ''He said, 'I've rewritten the ending,''' Mr. Sheekey said. His prepared speech had already been loaded into the teleprompter.\par \par \uc2 The new words were hardly soaring poetry. But in that moment, and in this season of high anxiety, they rang out.\par \par \uc2 ''Let's elect a sane, competent person,'' Mr. Bloomberg said.\par \par \uc2 He's not much of an orator, but when he got to the word ''sane,'' he hit it hard.\par \par \uc2 This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.\par \par \uc2 Email: dwyer@nytimes.com Twitter: @jimdwyernyt\par \par \uc2 Document NYTF000020160729ec7t0002z\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

Any casual surfing of the television channels tonight will show murder after murder. Sadly, some of the most dramatic ''crime stories'' never make prime time -- the stories of men and women being released from prison, facing barriers that limit housing and jobs, fighting personal demons while navigating societal restrictions, struggling just to get through the day.\par \par \uc2 Such stories are the ones that should be surfacing at political conventions.

\par\par \b \uc2 Clinton\uc2  Makes Her Pitch --- Nominee to Take On \uc2 Trump\uc2  in Rust Belt\b0\par\par\uc2 By Peter Nicholas and Carol E. Lee   \par \uc2 899 \uc2 words\par \uc2 29 July 2016\par \uc2 The Wall Street Journal\par \uc2 J\par A1\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 PHILADELPHIA -- \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's first order of business after the Democratic convention is a bus trip in the battlegrounds of Pennsylvania and Ohio, the opening move in a strategy to defend her party's grip on states President \uc2 Barack Obama\uc2  won and to brand her rival as unfit to be president.\par \par \uc2 It shows a campaign eager to close off a likely effort by \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2 , her Republican opponent, to build an Electoral College majority by winning working-class, white voters in the Rust Belt and other slowly diversifying states. Democrats hope to capitalize on a convention that has drawn stronger television ratings so far than those for the Republican convention last week.\par \par \uc2 Initially viewing Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  as possibly the weakest general-\uc2 election\uc2  candidate in the Republican primary field, Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's allies now accept that the campaign will be a slog. Polling shows the two candidates are running about even in the popular vote.\par \par \uc2 "I fully expect this to be a close and competitive \uc2 election\uc2  all the way through the end," said Geoff Garin, a pollster and strategist in Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's 2008 presidential campaign.\par \par \uc2 Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  has used the convention to address a basic vulnerability: Voters largely don't trust or like her. A Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll this month showed that 20% of Democrats have a negative view of her -- a higher number than for any Democratic nominee in the last quarter-century.\par \par \uc2 A string of convention speakers from her husband, former President \uc2 Bill \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , to President \uc2 Barack Obama\uc2 , told stories during the convention meant to show a warmer, more empathetic face of the former secretary of state, senator and first lady.\par \par \uc2 As Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  tries to make an affirmative case for herself, another clear goal of the \uc2 Clinton\uc2  campaign is to undercut Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , who himself is viewed negatively by a majority of voters, by raising concerns that he is so temperamentally unstable he can't be trusted with the nuclear codes.\par \par \uc2 John Podesta\uc2 , the \uc2 Clinton\uc2  campaign chairman, told reporters this week that the way to win is to demonstrate Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  is "unfit, that he's unprepared and that we can't put him in the Oval Office." He added: "That's the core of our strategy."\par \par \uc2 Republicans counter Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's persona is a liability. Michael Steele, a former Republican National Committee chairman, said in an interview: "This is not an \uc2 election\uc2  about policy and ideology. It's an \uc2 election\uc2  about, 'What do I think of you as a leader.' She has a lot of qualifications, but they just don't trust her or like her. That's hard" to overcome.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's campaign didn't immediately respond to requests for comment.\par \par \uc2 Clinton\uc2  aides are looking at the electoral map in granular detail to plot the best path to 270 electoral votes. It's no accident that Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  is planning a trip on Monday to Omaha. Under Nebraska's unusual system, candidates can pick up Electoral College votes by winning specific congressional districts. Mr. Obama picked up one electoral vote in 2008 by capturing the district that includes Omaha.\par \par \uc2 The campaign also hopes to retake North Carolina, a state that Mr. Obama won in 2008 but lost in 2012. Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  has made repeated trips to the state -- the latest to Charlotte on Monday.\par \par \uc2 Even Utah might be in play. Robby Mook, the \uc2 Clinton\uc2  campaign manager, said this week that the traditionally Republican state, which hasn't voted for the Democratic nominee since 1964, is a "heavy lift." But he added that Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  created "headwinds" for himself, having "alienated the Mormon Church."\par \par \uc2 At a rally in Utah in March, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  questioned whether the 2012 GOP nominee, \uc2 Mitt Romney\uc2 , was truly a Mormon.\par \par \uc2 "While I think it's going to be a close \uc2 election\uc2  in terms of the popular vote, she does have a distinct advantage in terms of the Electoral College map," Mr. Garin said. He said that she has "many more pathways" to an Electoral College majority than Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  has.\par \par \uc2 For Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  to win, he would need to flip some states that Democrats have been winning, such as Ohio and Pennsylvania, which helps explain why Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's bus tour starts in those two states, said David Axelrod, a former Obama White House and campaign adviser. "He's trying to put this together primarily among white voters," Mr. Axelrod said.\par \par \uc2 Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  will start her bus tour accompanied by Sen. Tim Kaine (D., Va.), her running mate. A roster of high-profile campaign surrogates also will stump for Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 . Mr. Obama's political team has been coordinating closely with the \uc2 Clinton\uc2  campaign and expects the president to be a frequent presence on the trail in the fall. With a job approval rating topping 50%, Mr. Obama can be particularly helpful in mobilizing minority voters and getting them to vote.\par \par \uc2 Mark Penn\uc2 , a senior strategist in Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's 2008 presidential race, said, "She now has an almost unprecedented team of surrogates, from President \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , who is great with swing voters, to President Obama, who can fire up the base and whose ratings have been rising."\par \par \uc2 (See related article: "Candidate Underlines Contrasts to Rival" -- WSJ July 29, 2016)\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=wjco20160729000119"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document J000000020160729ec7t00031\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw272\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4080\pichgoal600

\par\par \b \uc2 Clinton\uc2  Makes Her Pitch --- Candidate Underlines Contrasts to Rival\b0\par\par\uc2 By Laura Meckler and Siobhan Hughes   \par \uc2 1,017 \uc2 words\par \uc2 29 July 2016\par \uc2 The Wall Street Journal\par \uc2 J\par A1\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 PHILADELPHIA -- \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  accepted the Democratic Party's nomination for president Thursday, casting herself as a leader whose steadiness and unifying approach stand in sharp contrast with her opponent.\par \par \uc2 Her speech to a raucous convention crowd repeatedly slammed Republican nominee \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  as unfit and someone who "loses his cool at the slightest provocation." She referenced his own words from last week's Republican convention.\par \par \uc2 "Don't believe anyone who says 'I alone can fix it,'" she said. "Americans don't say: 'I alone can fix it.' We say: 'We'll fix it together.'"\par \par \uc2 But she also recognized that many Americans don't like her much, either, and suspect she's out for herself. Her speech -- and the entire week's convention -- aimed to improve her image with stories about her family and her early work for children. She said her interest in the details of policy matter to the people they affect. "I get it that some people just don't know what to make of me," she said.\par \par \uc2 Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  spoke for 57 minutes, 18 minutes fewer than Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's speech in Cleveland last week.\par \par \uc2 Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  leaves the Democratic National Convention with a largely unified party, set for an \uc2 election\uc2  that will test whether she can lead them to a third term in the White House. Her chief challenges include convincing Americans dissatisfied with the slow and uneven economic recovery and fearful of a spate of new terrorism attacks that staying the course is better than betting on the unpredictable agenda of Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 To win over skeptics, Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  outlined a plan to boost jobs, particularly for workers whose incomes have stagnated since the 2007 recession. Her immediate priorities, she said, would including a large increase in infrastructure spending, an immigration overhaul, new gun restrictions, paid family leave and significant new subsidies to make public college tuition-free for most families.\par \par \uc2 She said she would fund her plans with tax increases on Wall Street, corporations and the "super rich."\par \par \uc2 "Some of you are frustrated, even furious. And you know what? You're right," Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  said of Americans facing economic challenges.\par \par \uc2 Democrats argued all week that the New York billionaire was temperamentally unfit for the job. Taking note of turbulence and terrorism across the globe, Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  cast herself as the person prepared to be commander in chief.\par \par \uc2 "Imagine him in the Oval Office facing a real crisis. A man you can bait with a tweet is not a man we can trust with nuclear weapons," the former secretary of state said. Given the turbulence and terrorism across the globe, she said Americans are "looking for steady leadership."\par \par \uc2 Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  also drew an implicit contrast with Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's recent comments that he might not defend \uc2 NATO\uc2  allies if they don't keep their financial commitments. "I'm proud to stand by our allies in \uc2 NATO\uc2  against any threat they face, including from Russia," she said.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's fiery message of unfairness and decline in America has resonated with white, working class voters in particular. On Thursday, Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's goal was to paint a more hopeful, optimistic vision of a nation that comes together and is, as her campaign slogan puts it, "stronger together."\par \par \uc2 To underscore that message, the evening roster of speakers included a pair of Republicans and Khizr Khan, the father of a Muslim U.S. soldier from Virginia who was killed in Iraq.\par \par \uc2 "\uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2 , you're asking Americans to trust you with their future. Let me ask you: have you even read the United States Constitution? I will gladly lend you my copy," Mr. Khan said. "Have you ever been to Arlington Cemetery? Go look at the graves of brave patriots who died defending United States of America. You'll see all faiths, genders, and ethnicities. You have sacrificed nothing."\par \par \uc2 In her introduction, \uc2 Chelsea \uc2 Clinton\uc2  spoke in personal terms about her mother's care and devotion to her -- soccer games, a dinosaur park, notes left behind to open while she was out of town. "That feeling of being valued and loved -- that's what my mom wants for every child," she said.\par \par \uc2 Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's task was complicated by the passions stirred by her former primary rival Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders,who drew millions of supporters with his outrage over income inequality and campaign against the political and financial establishment.\par \par \uc2 While Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  and Mr. Sanders made their peace ahead of the convention week, his supporters sporadically protested his defeat outside and inside the Wells Fargo Center.\par \par \uc2 A June Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll underscored Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's challenge in following fellow Democrat \uc2 Barack Obama\uc2 's two terms. Asked if they wanted the next president to take a steady approach to the way government operates or to bring major changes even if it isn't clear what those changes will be, 56% favored change compared with 41% who wanted a steady approach.\par \par \uc2 "\uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  cannot afford to simply embrace the status quo, but must show that there will be a separate route for the country's future," said \uc2 Peter Hart\uc2 , who co-directs the Journal/NBC News poll.\par \par \uc2 Ed Rendell, a former governor of Pennsylvania and a \uc2 Clinton\uc2  backer, described the sort of voter who might be drawn to Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 : a welder who once earned $80,000 a year and is now bagging groceries. "If you're hurting, it's hard to convince you (to) keep the people who are in," he said.\par \par \uc2 Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  aimed to address those concerns, partly in personal terms. As she has many times on the campaign trail, she told the story of her mother, who was abandoned as a young girl and got by on the kindness of others. "No one gets through life alone," she said.

\par\par \b \uc2 The Democratic Convention: In Social Media Face-Off, Campaigns Come Out Even\b0\par\par\uc2 By Natalie Andrews   \par \uc2 453 \uc2 words\par \uc2 29 July 2016\par \uc2 The Wall Street Journal\par \uc2 J\par A5\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 The parties' conventions drew large audiences on social media, and it was hard to tell who was winning the engagement battle.\par \par \uc2 On the third day of the Democratic National Convention, 12 million \uc2 Facebook\uc2  users in the U.S. generated 44.4 million likes, posts, comments and shares related to the convention. The top post of Wednesday night was a photo shared by Democratic presidential nominee \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  of the candidate hugging President \uc2 Barack Obama\uc2  at the end of the program.\par \par \uc2 By comparison, on the third day of the Republican convention, when Indiana Gov. Mike Pence introduced himself to the delegates, 11.9 million \uc2 Facebook\uc2  users in the U.S. generated 40.3 million like, posts, comments and shares. The top post was a \uc2 Facebook\uc2  Live video of \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2 's helicopter arrival.\par \par \uc2 The two campaigns have tried to use social media to upstage one another's conventions.\par \par \uc2 On Tuesday Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  tweeted, "No matter what \uc2 Bill \uc2 Clinton\uc2  says and no matter how well he says it, the phony media will exclaim it to be incredible. Highly overrated!" On Wednesday, he hosted a \uc2 Reddit\uc2  "Ask Me Anything" during the Democratic convention early-evening programming.\par \par \uc2 On the same day as Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's big convention speech last week, the \uc2 Clinton\uc2  campaign launched "\uc2 Trump\uc2  yourself," an online app that superimposed insults quoted from Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's remarks onto supporters' \uc2 Facebook\uc2  profile pictures. In its first day and a half, the site had 1.2 million page views from over 800,000 unique visitors. Half of those people authorized their accounts to be connected to the app, granting the \uc2 Clinton\uc2  campaign access to their data, a \uc2 Clinton\uc2  campaign aide said.\par \par \uc2 Social media was an integral part of Mr. Obama's 2008 presidential campaign. The campaign rallied young voters through a \uc2 Facebook\uc2  app that gave it access to the lists of supporters' friends. The data Mr. Obama collected from social media is widely believed to have helped him connect with young voters.\par \par \uc2 In 2012, \uc2 Twitter\uc2  emerged as a medium for \uc2 election\uc2  news. The breakout social media star of the 2016 campaign is yet undecided, though Snapchat and \uc2 Twitter\uc2 's Periscope are vying for the crown.\par \par \uc2 Of the two 2016 candidates, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  has the largest following on social media -- with 10.3 million \uc2 Twitter\uc2  followers and 9.9 million \uc2 Facebook\uc2  likes, compared with Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's 7.78 million followers and 4.8 likes.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  is mentioned more on social media. "His supporters absolutely love him and his opponents absolutely dislike him," said Kellan Terry, political analyst at \uc2 Brandwatch\uc2 , a social media data company.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=wjco20160729000110"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document J000000020160729ec7t0002s\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw272\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4080\pichgoal600

\par\par \b \uc2 The Democratic Convention: Lobbyists Pick Up Where They Left Off --- Curbs on industry were lifted at this year's event, but few noticed the difference\b0\par\par\uc2 By Rebecca Ballhaus   \par \uc2 742 \uc2 words\par \uc2 29 July 2016\par \uc2 The Wall Street Journal\par \uc2 J\par A6\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 PHILADELPHIA -- The 2016 Democratic convention here was expected to mark a comeback for lobbyists at an event that four years earlier had banned their industry from donating to it.\par \par \uc2 Heather Podesta, one of Washington's top lobbyists, couldn't tell the difference.\par \par \uc2 This week's convention -- seen through the eyes of Ms. Podesta, whom The Wall Street Journal shadowed -- featured a slew of corporate-sponsored events and party gatherings. Attended by lobbyists and lawmakers alike, the festivities were lavish and at times bizarre.\par \par \uc2 There was a cocktail reception at a Walgreens where guests, sandwiched between the cough-drop aisle and a makeup display, sipped strawberry mojitos and chewed beet-flavored popcorn. The event was co-sponsored by Walgreens and Revlon, whose parent company, MacAndrews and Forbes, is among Ms. Podesta's clients.\par \par \uc2 At \uc2 FedEx\uc2 's afternoon party, lit entirely in purple, guests plucked shrimp from a two-foot-high pile and ate over gold-draped bar tables.\par \par \uc2 At the Democratic convention in 2012, registered lobbyists were prohibited from giving to the event and from donating to or working on the Obama presidential campaign. Instead, Ms. Podesta, who is a former sister-in-law of \uc2 Clinton\uc2  campaign Chairman \uc2 John Podesta\uc2 , raised money for congressional races.\par \par \uc2 But many convention perks -- credentials for box seats in the arena, tickets to the most exclusive parties -- were the same, and the rules were loose. Finance officials from the \uc2 Democratic National Committee\uc2  still attended events she hosted that week.\par \par \uc2 "We're part of the fiber of the political process," she said. "Having raised millions of dollars helping Democrats, I know a couple of them."\par \par \uc2 Ms. Podesta's unchanged experience in 2016 from four years ago illustrates how deeply lobbyists are enmeshed in the parties they support, financially or otherwise. At events this week, lobbyists and lawmakers exchanged hugs and air kisses, and several fondly referred to conventions as a "family reunion."\par \par \uc2 The restrictions imposed in 2012 didn't exist this year. Registered lobbyists through June raised $7 million for Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's campaign, and lobbyists are playing key roles in the political operations of campaigns in both parties.\par \par \uc2 Ms. Podesta, whose firm recently added a Republican arm, for the first time attended the GOP convention last week in Cleveland. She was in and out in 36 hours, but she left her mark with stickers bearing the slogan: "Make lobbying great again."\par \par \uc2 Conventions, she said, are about helping clients feel they aren't missing out on networking events.\par \par \uc2 Fundraising plays a major part in that. Lobbyists raise money for campaigns and political parties, and in return receive tickets and credentials for the evening's events.\par \par \uc2 At the end of Ms. Podesta's brunch Tuesday, her chief of staff parceled out her share of those tickets, which she could then pass on to clients and other prominent Democrats.\par \par \uc2 Ms. Podesta is a top bundler for Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's campaign, having raised over $400,000 for the former secretary of state through June, according to \uc2 Federal \uc2 Election\uc2  Commission\uc2  records. She has also donated nearly $240,000 to Democrats this \uc2 election\uc2  cycle, including nearly 30 congressional campaigns.\par \par \uc2 In 2012, while banned from the presidential \uc2 election\uc2 , Ms. Podesta placed a greater focus on Senate races. She donated $200,000 to congressional campaigns, parties and outside groups, including $75,000 to a Senate super PAC. In return, the parties helped make up the gap in credentials and tickets that the DNC typically would have supplied.\par \par \uc2 In the nearly 100-degree weather here, Ms. Podesta bustled between corporate-sponsored luncheons and cocktail parties. "I'm loving the puppy Snapchats," she told a congressman's fiancee, who recently acquired a new dog.\par \par \uc2 As evening drew closer, the rooms began to hum with chatter about what time to get to the arena that night, and which parties are best to attend. From there, Ms. Podesta would figure out which tickets her clients will want the most.\par \par \uc2 "My day-to-day work is being a substantive strategist and implementer," she said. "But for three weeks every four years, I'm a concierge."\par \par \uc2 The goal is to ensure all the goodies have been parceled out. "The biggest loser move," Ms. Podesta said, "is to walk into the hall with more than one credential."\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=wjco20160729000108"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document J000000020160729ec7t0002q\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw272\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4080\pichgoal600

Epstein   \par \uc2 539 \uc2 words\par \uc2 29 July 2016\par \uc2 The Wall Street Journal\par \uc2 J\par A7\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 Republican presidential nominee \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  said Thursday his comments inviting Russia to dig up \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's lost emails -- which caused an uproar from much of the U.S. national-security community -- weren't meant to be taken literally.\par \par \uc2 "Of course, I'm being sarcastic," Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  said during an appearance on Fox News.\par \par \uc2 Asked about fears that Russia might be meddling in the U.S. \uc2 election\uc2 , a top U.S. intelligence official on Thursday said Moscow could be seeking payback for what it viewedas concerted attempts by the U.S. to interfere in elections in Russia.\par \par \uc2 "They see a U.S. conspiracy behind every bush and ascribe far more impact than we're actually guilty of, but that's their mind-set," said U.S. Director of National Intelligence James Clapper, speaking at a security conference in Aspen, Colo.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Clapper said U.S. intelligence agencies haven't reached a firm conclusion on whether Russia or any other country was behind the recent computer breach that stole emails and other records from the \uc2 Democratic National Committee\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 "I'll just say that don't think we're quite ready yet to make a call on attribution," Mr. Clapper said. "I mean, we all know there are just a few usual suspects out there. But in terms of the process that we try to stick to, I don't think we're ready to make a public call yet."\par \par \uc2 Close to 20,000 of those emails were released by \uc2 WikiLeaks\uc2  last week, a move that proved embarrassing to senior DNC officials because they involved plots in some cases to undermine the presidential candidacy of Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont. DNC Chairman \uc2 Debbie Wasserman Schultz\uc2  resigned after the emails were made public.\par \par \uc2 The remarks by the nation's top intelligence chief came as Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  rejected criticism of his invitation Wednesday to the Russian government to hack into the emails of Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , his Democratic rival.\par \par \uc2 In the Fox News interview, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  also said Russian President \uc2 Vladimir Putin\uc2  is "a better leader" than President \uc2 Barack Obama\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 "He's a better leader than Obama, because Obama's not a leader, so he's certainly doing a better job than Obama is," Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  said.\par \par \uc2 Though Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's invitation to the Russia government drew bipartisan criticism, the White House on Thursday said the GOP nominee would soon begin receiving classified intelligence briefings.\par \par \uc2 "The administration is confident that they can both provide relevant and sufficient briefings to the two major party presidential candidates, while also protecting sensitive national security information," White House press secretary \uc2 Josh Earnest\uc2  said.\par \par \uc2 In response to a question about recent comments by Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  on foreign policy, particularly the U.S. relationship with the \uc2 North Atlantic Treaty Organization\uc2  and the development of nuclear weapons in Asia, Mr. Clapper said he wouldn't offer any opinion. But he said he has heard concerns from his counterparts overseas based on rhetoric on the campaign trail. "I can say with some authority that such statements, such rhetoric are very bothersome to our foreign interlocutors, our foreign partners," he said.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=wjco20160729000053"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document J000000020160729ec7t0001f\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw272\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4080\pichgoal600

\par\par \b \uc2 Election\uc2  2016: Tight House Races Heat Up\b0\par\par\uc2 By Kristina Peterson   \par \uc2 754 \uc2 words\par \uc2 29 July 2016\par \uc2 The Wall Street Journal\par \uc2 J\par A7\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 The end of the Democratic convention marks the conclusion of the presidential nominating contest, but not the end of the congressional primary season, which could still see some of its biggest upsets next week.\par \par \uc2 The anti-Establishment sentiment that helped install \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  as the GOP's presidential nominee hasn't sent many House Republicans tumbling from their perches so far.\par \par \uc2 As of this month, two House GOP lawmakers have lost primaries: Reps. Renee Ellmers of North Carolina and Randy Forbes of Virginia. In both cases, redistricting in the state played a key role in the shake-up.\par \par \uc2 On the Democratic side, one lawmaker lost his party's nomination. Former Rep. Chaka Fattah of Pennsylvania was defeated in April after he was indicted on charges of misusing hundreds of thousands of dollars of taxpayer, charity and campaign funds. Mr. Fattah resigned in June after a federal jury convicted him.\par \par \uc2 "The three incumbents we've seen lose were under extraordinary circumstances," rather than a reflection of this year's populist uprising, said Nathan Gonzales, editor of the nonpartisan Rothenberg & Gonzales Political Report. "The lack of incumbents losing primaries is a remarkable story line so far this \uc2 election\uc2  cycle."\par \par \uc2 That could begin to change next week, when two House Republicans appear vulnerable on their own -- without new district lines playing a role. Still, both lawmakers have unusual personal and political situations that made them targets, rather than being part of a broad-based frustration with incumbents.\par \par \uc2 In Kansas, third-term GOP Rep. Tim Huelskamp faces a rare serious challenge not from a more conservative rival, but from a more centrist one.\par \par \uc2 Roger Marshall\uc2 , an obstetrician-gynecologist, could benefit from local frustration with Mr. Huelskamp, whose dust-ups with GOP congressional leaders have given him a reputation as an obstructionist. The lawmaker has frequently voted against leadership-backed budget and debt-limit bills, saying they aren't conservative enough for him to support.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Huelskamp lost his coveted spot on the House Agriculture Committee in 2012 after tangling with GOP leaders. That helped persuade the \uc2 Kansas Farm Bureau\uc2  earlier this month to endorse Mr. Marshall -- the first time the influential trade group has ever backed a challenger over an incumbent in that district. In December, the \uc2 Kansas Livestock Association\uc2  endorsed Mr. Marshall.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Huelskamp has said his relationship with GOP leadership has improved since former House Speaker \uc2 John Boehner\uc2  of Ohio was succeeded by \uc2 Paul Ryan\uc2  of Wisconsin last year.\par \par \uc2 He is now on the House Steering Committee, the powerful internal Republican group in charge of doling out committee assignments, and has said he expects to be reinstated to the agriculture panel.\par \par \uc2 In Tennessee, third-term GOP Rep. Scott DesJarlais's Aug. 4 primary could also be a nail-biter reminiscent of his victory by less than 40 votes two years ago. His biggest rival this year is expected to be Grant Starrett, a young real-estate executive who worked on 2012 GOP presidential nominee \uc2 Mitt Romney\uc2 's campaign.\par \par \uc2 Mr. DesJarlais hopes to have gotten past a controversy in 2012 when the public became aware of court transcripts from his divorce proceedings that showed that he had extramarital affairs and that his ex-wife had two abortions. Mr. DesJarlais opposes abortion rights.\par \par \uc2 As of July 15, Mr. DesJarlais had less than $250,000 in cash on hand, compared with more than $377,000 for Mr. Starrett.\par \par \uc2 "We've always run a lean campaign because he's a conservative and he's not going to take people's money if he doesn't need it," said Tyler Privette, Mr. DesJarlais's campaign manager. Mr. Privette said the controversy surrounding the lawmaker's divorce has receded and that his constituents are more focused on "issues that will affect their day-to-day lives."\par \par \uc2 On the Democratic side, next week will determine which two candidates in Washington will advance in the competitive race to succeed Rep. Jim McDermott, who is retiring after nearly three decades in the House.\par \par \uc2 Under Washington's top-two primary system, the two candidates from any party who do best on Tuesday will advance to November's general \uc2 election\uc2 , but the favorites in the liberal district are all Democrats.\par \par \uc2 The leading contenders are state \uc2 Sen. Pramila Jayapal\uc2 , who was endorsed by Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders; state House legislator Brady Pinero Walkinshaw and King County Council Chairman Joe McDermott, who isn't related to the incumbent.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=wjco20160729000052"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document J000000020160729ec7t0001e\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 Politics; SECT\par \b \uc2 Democratic Convention Night 3: What You Missed\b0\par\par\uc2 By NICHOLAS FANDOS  \par \uc2 826 \uc2 words\par \uc2 28 July 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 The New York Times on the Web\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved.  \par \par \uc2 President Obama defended his legacy and laid out the ways \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  would continue it at the Democratic National Convention on Wednesday. Other speakers included Vice President \uc2 Joseph R. Biden Jr\uc2 ., \uc2 Michael R. Bloomberg\uc2  and Senator Tim Kaine, Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's running mate.\par \par \uc2 Here are the highlights (or watch live and get our real-time analysis):\par \par \uc2 Mr. Obama, in the night's most anticipated speech, offered a defiantly optimistic assessment of America's future and of the woman who he hopes will lead it. Even as he acknowledged ''we're not done perfecting our union,'' he said that in his experience, \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's vision of the country as chaotic and in decline rang hollow and would not be rewarded.\par \par \uc2 ''The America I know is full of courage, and optimism, and ingenuity,'' Mr. Obama said, amid searing attacks on Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , the Republican nominee. ''This year, in this \uc2 election\uc2 , I'm asking you to join me -- to reject cynicism, reject fear, to summon what's best in us.''\par \par \uc2 Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  shares that vision, he said, and she has been ''in the arena'' fighting for it for much of her life.\par \par \uc2 _____\par \par \uc2 With the convention floor still on its feet for Mr. Obama, Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  walked out on stage and warmly embraced the president. She did not make any remarks but greeted the crowd with waves.\par \par \uc2 _____\par \par \uc2 Mr. Kaine delivered his first major national address since joining Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's ticket, and he packed a lot in. Slipping between English and Spanish and, at times, into an impersonation of Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , Mr. Kaine sought to sow doubt about Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's character and bolster Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's. Along the way, he also introduced himself to voters across the country unfamiliar with his record.\par \par \uc2 ''If any of you are looking for that party of Lincoln,'' Mr. Kaine said in a direct appeal to dissatisfied Republicans, ''we've got a home for you.''\par \par \uc2 _____\par \par \uc2 In an emotional and fiery appeal to middle-class Americans, Mr. Biden laid out a vision of an America that ''always, always moves forward'' on the strength of its values. Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , he said, was not only unfit to lead such a nation through a dangerous world, but his \uc2 election\uc2  would be a betrayal of the nation's values.\par \par \uc2 ''A man who seeks to sow division in America for his own gain and disorder around the world, a man who confuses bluster with strength -- we simply cannot let that happen as Americans,'' Mr. Biden said.\par \par \uc2 _____\par \par \uc2 Mr. Bloomberg, the former mayor of New York and a political independent who opted not to run for president, said he was addressing the convention to convey a single message: ''It is an imperative that we elect \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  the next president of the United States.''\par \par \uc2 Leaning on his own business record, Mr. Bloomberg, a billionaire, said he understood ''the appeal of a businessman president'' but that Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  was ''a risky, reckless, radical choice.''\par \par \uc2 _____\par \par \uc2 Leon E. Panetta, who served as both C.I.A. director and defense secretary under Mr. Obama, delivered a sharp rebuke of Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's comments Wednesday encouraging Russian intelligence services to hack Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's email.\par \par \uc2 ''\uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  today once again took Russia's side,'' Mr. Panetta said, adding, ''it is inconceivable to me that any presidential candidate would be that irresponsible.''\par \par \uc2 ''This is no time to gamble with our future,'' he said.\par \par \uc2 _____\par \par \uc2 Greeted with chants of his name, Harry Reid, the Senate Democrats' retiring leader, outlined one final fight: defeating Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  to preserve the party's legislative agenda. He also tied Senate Republicans, who he said had given rise to ''a hateful con man,'' to Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's candidacy, a strategy that Democrats think could help them retake control of the Senate.\par \par \uc2 _____\par \par \uc2 Governor Jerry Brown of California turned the convention's full attention toward climate change for the first time this week. Calling it ''the existential threat of our time,'' Mr. Brown painted the Republican ticket as dangerously anti-science. And lifting California up as an example, he said Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  would help usher in a national green economy that would not only mitigate environmental disaster but also create jobs.\par \par \uc2 ''\uc2 Trump\uc2  says there's no drought in California,'' he said. ''I say \uc2 Trump\uc2  lies.''\par \par \uc2 _____\par \par \uc2 Crime and policing were major themes at last week's Republican convention, but Charles H. Ramsey, a former head of police in Philadelphia and Washington, suggested they had missed the mark. Gun violence will drop with the adoption of ''common sense'' gun measures, he said, and ''frayed'' relationships between communities and police will be restored only through ''strong, steady'' leadership like Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's. ''We can't play to America's worst fears,'' he said.

\par\par \uc2 EDITORIAL\par \uc2 Editorial Desk; SECTA\par \b \uc2 What Was Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  Thinking?\b0\par\par\uc2 By THE EDITORIAL BOARD \par \uc2 638 \uc2 words\par \uc2 28 July 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 26\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 From the beginning, \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  has styled his presidential campaign as an insurgency that upended rules and challenged conventions. In the process, he has exposed himself repeatedly as a purveyor of views that are not only outside the political mainstream, but decidedly un-American.\par \par \uc2 On Wednesday, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  crossed a new line by practically inviting Russia, an increasingly aggressive American adversary, to interfere in the presidential \uc2 election\uc2  by cyberspying on \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's email correspondence when she was secretary of state. ''Russia, if you're listening, I hope you're able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing,'' Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  told a news conference. ''I think you will probably be rewarded mightily by our press.'' And this came just days after fingers started pointing at Russia as the possible culprit in the hacking of \uc2 Democratic National Committee\uc2  computers holding emails that became public.\par \par \uc2 Some \uc2 Trump\uc2  supporters dismissed the comments as the master reality-television showman once again doing and saying outrageous things for entertainment value. Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  has proved to be crafty at dominating news cycles; on Wednesday, his headline-grabbing news conference was all the more strategic coming hours before President Obama's speech on Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's behalf at the Democratic convention.\par \par \uc2 Given that many voters are uneasy about Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's email issue, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  is not about to let it fade. Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  was investigated by the Justice Department for her use of private servers, and no charges were brought. Whatever Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  may think of that outcome, it in no way justifies his call for a foreign power to spy electronically on his opponent, a proposition so shocking it immediately triggered a debate on social media and elsewhere about whether it was treason.\par \par \uc2 It is not treason. It is constitutionally protected free speech. Nonetheless, the remarks further call into question Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's commitment to democracy, his understanding of what it means to be commander in chief and his fitness to lead. He was, in effect, urging Russia to commit a crime that would damage national security.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's friendly come-on to the Russians came the morning after American intelligence agencies told the White House they had ''high confidence'' that Russian intelligence was behind the hacked D.N.C. computers, leading to the release of nearly 20,000 emails that showed favoritism toward Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  over Senator Bernie Sanders. The United States is actively trying to discourage hacking, which is a criminal act, and get countries like China to adhere to norms for operating in cyberspace.\par \par \uc2 What Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  should have done was to warn President \uc2 Vladimir Putin\uc2  of Russia that if he interfered in the \uc2 election\uc2 , American political leaders would be united in imposing consequences of some kind on his nation, as the Republican candidate's vice-presidential running mate, \uc2 Gov. Mike Pence\uc2  of Indiana, has suggested.\par \par \uc2 That Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  has not done so reinforces the growing perception that he is ready and willing to pursue policies favored by Mr. Putin, who has made clear his preference for Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  over Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 . News reports have questioned Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's financial dealings with Russian companies, providing another reason he should release his tax returns, like all recent major party presidential candidates.\par \par \uc2 The bizarre affinity for Mr. Putin is just one reason to question Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's judgment. He has endorsed waterboarding, even though it is illegal; he has argued for retaliating against political enemies and journalists; and he has proposed excluding people from America based on their religion. It grows ever harder to imagine that he could honor the high office to which he aspires.\par \par \uc2 Follow The \uc2 New York Times\uc2  Opinion section on \uc2 Facebook\uc2  and \uc2 Twitter\uc2  (@NYTOpinion), and sign up for the Opinion Today newsletter.\par \par \uc2 Document NYTF000020160728ec7s0006x\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

Reporting was contributed by Gary Gately from Baltimore; Ashley Parker from Doral, Fla.; and Richard P\u233\'00\'E9rez-Pe\u241\'00\'F1a from New York. \par \uc2 1,491 \uc2 words\par \uc2 28 July 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 1\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 BALTIMORE -- The state's attorney here dropped all remaining charges Wednesday against three city police officers awaiting trial in the death of Freddie Gray, closing the book on one of the most closely watched police prosecutions in the nation without a single conviction -- and few answers about precisely how the young man died.\par \par \uc2 The announcement ended a sweeping, deeply polarizing prosecution that began last spring, as National Guard troops rumbled through the streets, with Baltimore under curfew and residents tense after looting and riots that broke out after Mr. Gray sustained a fatal spinal cord injury in police custody.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Gray, a 25-year-old black man, had been arrested after he spotted a police presence as he walked with friends and ran away. He was found unresponsive and not breathing after he rode unsecured in a police transport wagon after his arrest on a bright morning in April 2015, and died a week later. Six officers were charged with crimes including manslaughter and murder; the first trial ended in a hung jury, and three more officers were acquitted after trials before a judge.\par \par \uc2 Wednesday's extraordinary turn put into sharp relief the wrenching national debate over race and policing, after a month of deadly shootings of black men and deadly retaliations against police officers around the nation. Just a few weeks ago, President \uc2 Obama\uc2  pleaded for racial healing after five police officers in Dallas were gunned down by a black Army veteran. The outcome also left the city deeply divided over whether its top prosecutor, Marilyn J. Mosby, 36, had overreached in her initial charges.\par \par \uc2 Facing cameras in front of a bright-colored mural -- a homage to Mr. Gray -- in the blighted West Baltimore neighborhood where he grew up, she defended herself, sounding every bit as fiery and passionate as she was a year ago in May when she drew national attention in announcing the charges. She accused the police department of working to thwart her investigation.\par \par \uc2 ''We do not believe Freddie Gray killed himself,'' Ms. Mosby said, calling the decision to drop the charges ''agonizing.'' Complaining she lacked an independent investigatory agency, she added, ''Without real substantive reforms to the current criminal justice system, we could try this case 100 times and cases just like it, and we would still end up with the same result.''\par \par \uc2 But a police union official, Lt. Gene Ryan, and lawyers for the six officers struck back, with Lieutenant Ryan calling Ms. Mosby's accusations ''outrageous.'' They argued that the judge, Barry G. Williams, who had prosecuted police misconduct while working for the Justice Department, had followed the evidence -- even if Ms. Mosby did not like where it led.\par \par \uc2 ''You can get a conviction against the police, whether a bench trial or a jury trial, if you do an investigation,'' said one of the lawyers, Ivan Bates. But, he said, if ''you quickly want to automatically say that the officers are guilty because they're the police, then you perpetrate that fear that's already there and that's dividing our country.''\par \par \uc2 The exchanges showed that even in a majority-black city, with a black mayor and a black prosecutor, there are no easy answers to questions involving race and policing. The case featured a black victim and had a black judge. And three of the six officers are black, as is the defense lawyer who spoke on their behalf Wednesday.\par \par \uc2 In the end, there was anguish on all sides of the debate here and around the country.\par \par \uc2 ''We're nowhere,'' \uc2 Chuck Wexler\uc2 , executive director of the Police Executive Research Forum, said in a telephone interview. ''Both sides walk away from this feeling like they didn't get justice -- the people who were concerned about Freddie Gray, and the people who are concerned about cops doing their job.''\par \par \uc2 ''We haven't gotten to the bottom of the Freddie Gray case,'' he said.\par \par \uc2 Despite the lack of convictions, Ms. Mosby, 36, argued that her work had not been for naught; there have been police department reforms, and the city is ''one step closer to equality.'' Officers now routinely buckle up prisoners traveling in police wagons, she said, and cameras record what happens inside.\par \par \uc2 In Baltimore, Wednesday's news was met with grim resignation. Supporters and detractors of the police seemed, by this point, to expect the outcome. And it was clear that, more than a year after the arrest of Mr. Gray, whom officers said was carrying an illegal knife, deep divisions remained.\par \par \uc2 In the Sandtown-Winchester neighborhood, where Mr. Gray grew up, residents unanimously agreed with Ms. Mosby's assertion that Mr. Gray's death was a homicide. Alethea Booze, 72, said she had witnessed the arrest. ''He wasn't hollering until two officers put that knee in his back and he was screaming,'' Ms. Booze said. ''Everybody was screaming, 'Call the ambulance, call the ambulance,' and the officers didn't do anything.''\par \par \uc2 All six officers face administrative hearings led by the police in nearby counties. Four are back at work, a in desk jobs. The Department of Justice is investigating the Baltimore Police Department to determine if it engaged in a pattern of racial discrimination.\par \par \uc2 Ms. Mosby's move caused ripples on the presidential campaign trial, as the Republican nominee, \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , who has cast himself as the law-and-order candidate, sharply criticized her, telling reporters, ''I think she ought to prosecute herself.''\par \par \uc2 Ms. Mosby was elected in 2014 on a promise to aggressively prosecute police misconduct; she faces re-\uc2 election\uc2  in 2018. But she is under intense pressure from activists who say she has not done enough to prosecute misconduct in less high-profile cases; on Wednesday, she vowed to ''fight for a fair and equitable justice system for all, so that whatever happened to Freddie Gray never happens to another person in this community again.''\par \par \uc2 Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake -- who decided not to seek re-\uc2 election\uc2  after the unrest -- asked residents to be patient as they absorbed the news. On Tuesday night in Philadelphia, the mayor called the roll that resulted in the nomination of Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  for president, part of her duties as secretary of the Democratic National Committee.\par \par \uc2 To Black Lives Matter activists, the outcome was a clear disappointment -- though perhaps not a surprise. DeRay Mckesson, a leader of the movement who ran unsuccessfully for mayor of Baltimore, echoed Ms. Mosby's call for criminal justice reform.\par \par \uc2 ''The dismissals are a reminder that the laws, practices and policies justify the actions of the police at all costs,'' Mr. Mckesson said in a text message. ''Freddie Gray should be alive today and someone should be held responsible for his death.''\par \par \uc2 The officers' trials opened with a sputter in December, when a jury deadlocked in the case of Officer William G. Porter, who had checked on Mr. Gray during the van ride, but had not belted him in or called medical attention. The mistrial caused delays -- Ms. Mosby's office appealed to Maryland's highest court in a successful bid to compel Officer Porter to testify against his fellow officers -- but the next up, Edward M. Nero, was acquitted in May.\par \par \uc2 The driver of the van, Officer Caesar R. Goodson Jr., faced the toughest charge -- second-degree murder -- and was acquitted in June. And Lt. Brian Rice, the highest-ranking officer present for the arrest, was acquitted this month.\par \par \uc2 Over four trials, prosecutors and defense lawyers argued that Mr. Gray's injury had occurred in the van, and Judge Williams agreed in his ruling in Lieutenant Rice's case. But outside the courthouse, in the streets of Mr. Gray's neighborhood, another theory on his death has thrived: that he was injured by the officers before he got into the van.\par \par \uc2 The theory is fed by some witness statements and a video showing Mr. Gray being dragged into the van, his legs mostly limp (although he appeared to make some limited motion), that have impressed themselves far deeper into the city's consciousness than prosecutors' arguments have.\par \par \uc2 That -- coupled with the lack of convictions and now the abandonment of the prosecution altogether -- has fed a lingering sense of frustration among those who once saw in Ms. Mosby's prosecution a hopeful sign.\par \par \uc2 ''We thought we were going to get answers -- the way proceedings have gone, that has not come about,'' said A. Dwight Pettit, a Baltimore lawyer who has represented plaintiffs in police brutality cases. ''That's the tragedy of this case.''\par \par \uc2 Marilyn J. Mosby, Baltimore's top prosecutor, spoke at a news conference Wednesday as Freddie Gray's father, in cap, looked on.

\par\par \uc2 National Desk; SECTA\par \b \uc2 Cybersecurity Experts Aren't Sure if Email Hacker Is a Person or a Front\b0\par\par\uc2 By CHARLIE SAVAGE and NICOLE PERLROTH \par \uc2 1,223 \uc2 words\par \uc2 28 July 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 16\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 WASHINGTON -- Who is Guccifer 2.0, the self-proclaimed Romanian ''lone hacker'' responsible for copying thousands of emails and other files from the \uc2 Democratic National Committee\uc2  -- a real person, or a front created by Russian intelligence officials?\par \par \uc2 Technology specialists have been debating that question since June 15, when \uc2 CrowdStrike\uc2 , a cybersecurity firm hired by the \uc2 Democratic National Committee\uc2 , announced that sophisticated hacker groups with Russian links were responsible for breaching the committee's computer servers. Within hours of the announcement, someone using the moniker Guccifer 2.0 started a blog to mock that finding, posting several of the stolen documents and claiming sole credit.\par \par \uc2 But the publication by \uc2 WikiLeaks\uc2  of an archive of the committee's internal emails -- and the uproar they caused on the eve of the Democratic National Convention -- have focused wider attention on who, or what, is operating behind that name. While \uc2 WikiLeaks\uc2  has not said how it obtained the emails, Guccifer 2.0 claimed in a blog post last month to have sent them to \uc2 WikiLeaks\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Cybersecurity specialists have pointed to an array of forensic and technical evidence suggesting that Guccifer 2.0 might not be a Romanian as claimed. That evidence included metadata hidden in the early documents indicating that they were edited on a computer with Russian language settings. American intelligence officials believe that Guccifer 2.0 is a front for the G.R.U., Russia's military intelligence service, according to federal officials briefed on the investigation.\par \par \uc2 In blog posts, \uc2 Twitter\uc2  messages, and electronic chats with journalists, Guccifer 2.0 has insisted such skeptics are wrong.\par \par \uc2 Against that backdrop, Guccifer 2.0's words are taking on heightened interest. They may be clues to a person's decision to intervene in the American \uc2 election\uc2 , or they may be a case study of a 21st-century Russian information campaign -- the work of different intelligence officials, crowded around a keyboard.\par \par \uc2 ''Just because the Wizard of Oz says he's a wizard doesn't actually mean he is,'' said Peter Singer, a security strategist at the \uc2 New America Foundation\uc2 , a public policy institute.\par \par \uc2 The original ''Guccifer'' (pronounced GUCCI-fer) is a real person: Marcel Lazar Lehel, a Romanian hacker who used the pseudonym Guccifer to hack various accounts belonging to American celebrities and government officials, including members of the Bush family, former Secretary of State Colin L. Powell, and Sidney Blumenthal, an informal adviser to \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Mr. Lehel was arrested in Romania in 2014 for hacking the email accounts of several Romanian officials. In April, he was extradited to the United States to face hacking charges and pleaded guilty in May before a federal judge in Alexandria, Va. While awaiting sentencing, Mr. Lehel claimed to have hacked Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's private email server, but federal officials have found no evidence to support his claim.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Lehel is known for his fixation on what conspiracy theorists call the Illuminati, a shadowy group that they believe controls the world. The first Guccifer 2.0 blog post, and messages Guccifer 2.0 sent along with packages of files that same day to the websites Gawker and The Smoking Gun, also denounced the Illuminati.\par \par \uc2 Other oddities also arose. Technical specialists, scouring metadata on documents posted to Guccifer 2.0's blog, found some that were last marked by a person with a user name in Cyrillic that appeared to be a nod to Felix E. Dzerzhinsky, best known for establishing the early Soviet secret police forces.\par \par \uc2 On June 21, Motherboard, an online technology magazine, posted a \uc2 Twitter\uc2  chat log of an interview with Guccifer 2.0, in which the person using that account claimed to be Romanian and denied working with the Russian government. Pressed on why Russian language markings showed up in the metadata of the documents he had sent out, Guccifer 2.0 claimed that was just a ''watermark.''\par \par \uc2 ''I don't like Russians and their foreign policy. I hate being attributed to Russia,'' Guccifer 2.0 wrote.\par \par \uc2 During the interview, Motherboard switched from using English to Romanian and to Russian. Guccifer 2.0 claimed not to speak Russian and abruptly cut off the interview.\par \par \uc2 Motherboard later reported findings of linguistics specialists who said that his Romanian answers did not seem like those of a native speaker, and that the syntax of several of his English lines echoed Russian sentence constructions.\par \par \uc2 And a linguistic analysis provided to The \uc2 New York Times\uc2  by Shlomo Argamon, a chief scientist at Taia's Global, a cybersecurity firm that has questioned cyberattack attribution claims in the past, also concluded that Guccifer 2 is Russian.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Argamon, who is a professor of computer science and the director of the master of data science program at the Illinois Institute of Technology, found seven oddities in the hacker's English text, five of which pointed clearly to Russian as the speaker's native tongue.\par \par \uc2 ''The linguistic evidence consistently points towards the writer being either a native Russian speaker,'' Mr. Argamon said. ''It is possible that the writer is a Romanian speaker who has studied Russian. However, the writer denied knowing any Russian, and so the most reasonable conclusion is that he is a Russian native speaker rather than a Romanian native speaker.''\par \par \uc2 On June 30, Guccifer 2.0 posted additional documents from the Democratic National Commitee's servers on the WordPress blog. The post again denied Russian links, and spoke admiringly of Julian Assange, the founder of \uc2 WikiLeaks\uc2 ; Edward J. Snowden, the former intelligence analyst who leaked archives of surveillance documents; and Chelsea Manning, the Army private who sent a huge trove of military and diplomatic documents to \uc2 WikiLeaks\uc2  in 2010.\par \par \uc2 That post accused Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  of being ''bought and sold,'' in contrast to Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , who it said ''has earned his money himself. And at least he is sincere in what he says.''\par \par \uc2 But the post still expressed opposition to Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's ideas ''about closing borders and deportation policy.'' Of Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, the post said, ''He never had a chance to win the nomination as the Democratic Party itself stood against him!''\par \par \uc2 The Hill, a newspaper that covers Congress, reported on July 13 that Guccifer 2.0 had reached out to it and had provided documents about Democratic campaign donors and lobbyists.\par \par \uc2 It quoted Guccifer 2.0 as saying in an electronic chat, ''The press [is] gradually forget[ing] about me, [W]ikileaks is playing for time and [I] have some more docs.'' The next day, Guccifer 2.0 posted those documents on the blog. That was the last blog posting.\par \par \uc2 The Guccifer 2.0 \uc2 Twitter\uc2  account posted a few more messages. The most recent one, on July 22, expressed excitement that \uc2 WikiLeaks\uc2  had posted the archive of nearly 20,000 Democratic committee emails that ''I'd given them!!!''\par \par \uc2 Since then, that account has fallen silent, too. No messages were posted even as the Democratic Party chairwoman, Representative \uc2 Debbie Wasserman Schultz\uc2 , resigned and Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's campaign manager accused the Russian government of providing the leaked emails to \uc2 WikiLeaks\uc2  to help Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Find out what you need to know about the 2016 presidential race today, and get politics news updates via \uc2 Facebook\uc2 , \uc2 Twitter\uc2  and the First Draft newsletter.\par \par \uc2 Document NYTF000020160728ec7s0004u\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 DORAL, Fla. -- \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2  said on Wednesday that he hoped Russian intelligence services had successfully hacked \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's email, and encouraged them to publish whatever they may have stolen, essentially urging a foreign adversary to conduct cyberespionage against a former secretary of state.\par \par \uc2 ''Russia, if you're listening, I hope you're able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing,'' Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  said during a news conference here in an apparent reference to Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's deleted emails. ''I think you will probably be rewarded mightily by our press.''\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's call was another bizarre moment in the mystery of whether \uc2 Vladimir V. Putin\uc2 's government has been seeking to influence the United States' presidential race.\par \par \uc2 His comments came amid questions about the hacking of the \uc2 Democratic National Committee\uc2 's computer servers, which American intelligence agencies have told the White House they have ''high confidence'' was the work of the Russian government.\par \par \uc2 At the same news conference, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  also appeared to leave the door open to accepting Russia's annexation of Crimea two years ago -- which the United States and its European allies consider an illegal seizure of territory. That seizure, and the continued efforts of Russian-aided insurgents to undermine the government of Ukraine, are the reason that the United States and its allies still have economic sanctions in force against Moscow.\par \par \uc2 When asked whether he would recognize Crimea ''as Russian territory'' and lift the sanctions, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  said: ''We'll be looking at that. Yeah, we'll be looking.''\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's apparent willingness to avoid condemning Mr. Putin's government is a remarkable departure from United States policy and Republican Party orthodoxy, and has fueled the questions about Russian meddling in the campaign. Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  has denied that, saying at the news conference that he has never met Mr. Putin, and has no investments in Russia.\par \par \uc2 ''I would treat \uc2 Vladimir Putin\uc2  firmly, but there's nothing I can think of that I'd rather do than have Russia friendly as opposed to the way they are right now,'' he said, ''so that we can go and knock out ISIS together.''\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  later tried to modify his remarks about hacking Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's emails, contending they represented an effort to get the Russians to turn over their trove to the F.B.I.\par \par \uc2 With the political conventions coming to an end on Thursday, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  is expected to receive his first national security briefings from American intelligence agencies in coming days. It is unclear whether those briefings -- which describe the global challenges facing the United States but not continuing covert operations or especially sensitive intelligence -- will change any of his views.\par \par \uc2 His comments about Russian hacking came on a day when Obama administration officials were already beginning to develop options for possible retaliation against Russia for the attack on the \uc2 Democratic National Committee\uc2 . As is often the case after cyber incidents, the options for responding are limited and can be viewed as seeming too mild or too escalatory.\par \par \uc2 The administration has not publicly accused the Russian government of the \uc2 Democratic National Committee\uc2  hacking, or presented evidence to back up such a case. The leaked documents, first published by a hacker who called himself ''Guccifer 2.0'' and who is now believed to be a character created by Russian intelligence, portrayed some committee officials as favoring Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's candidacy while denigrating her opponent, Senator Bernie Sanders. The release of the internal party emails and documents led to the resignation of \uc2 Debbie Wasserman Schultz\uc2  as chairwoman of the party.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  contended on Wednesday that the political uproar over whether Russia was meddling in the \uc2 election\uc2  was a ''total deflection'' from the embarrassing content of the emails. Many Republicans, even some who say they do not support Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , say they agree.\par \par \uc2 If Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  is serious in his call for Russian hacking or exposing Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's emails, he would be urging a power often hostile to the United States to violate American law by breaking into a private computer network. He would also be contradicting the Republican platform, adopted last week in Cleveland, saying that cyberespionage ''will not be tolerated,'' and promising to ''respond in kind and in greater magnitude'' to all Chinese and Russian cyberattacks.\par \par \uc2 In the past, the Obama administration has stopped short of retaliating against Russia -- at least in any public fashion -- for its attacks on the State Department and White House unclassified email systems, or on networks used by the Joint Chiefs of Staff. It never even publicly identified Russian intelligence as the source of those intrusions, though the subject was widely discussed by senior United States officials when they were not speaking for attribution.\par \par \uc2 In contrast, the United States did bring indictments against Chinese and Iranian hackers for thefts of intellectual property and attacks on American banks, and imposed economic sanctions against North Korea in early 2015, for hacking into \uc2 Sony Pictures Entertainment\uc2 's computers.\par \par \uc2 Almost as soon as Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  spoke, other Republicans raced in to try to reframe his remarks and argue that Russia should be punished. A spokesman for Speaker Paul D. Ryan termed Russia ''a global menace led by a devious thug.'' The spokesman, Brendan Buck, added: ''Putin should stay out of this \uc2 election\uc2 .''\par \par \uc2 Even \uc2 Gov. Mike Pence\uc2  of Indiana, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's running mate, issued a statement, saying that ''if it is Russia and they are interfering in our elections, I can assure you both parties and the United States government will ensure there are serious consequences.'' Mr. Pence did not attend Wednesday's news conference because he was giving local television interviews, and an aide to Mr. Pence said that his team had written his statement about Russia before Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  began speaking.\par \par \uc2 Shortly after that Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  sent a message on \uc2 Twitter\uc2  declaring ''If Russia or any other country or person has \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's 33,000 illegally deleted emails, perhaps they should share them with the \uc2 FBI\uc2 !''\par \par \uc2 The fact that the Democratic committee's servers were targeted -- and, apparently, not those of the \uc2 Republican National Committee\uc2  -- has brought up inevitable comparisons with the origins of the Watergate scandal, when burglars found little after breaking into Democratic committee offices before the 1972 \uc2 election\uc2 . The hackers, more than 40 years later, were more successful: A reconstruction of events suggests the first successful piercing of the Democrats' networks occurred in June 2015, long before the Russians, or anyone else, could have known Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  would get the nomination.\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 Clinton\uc2  campaign, eager to turn the subject from the chaos caused by the email release to the question of Russian interference, accused Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  of encouraging Russian espionage.\par \par \uc2 ''This has to be the first time that a major presidential candidate has actively encouraged a foreign power to conduct espionage against his political opponent,'' said Jake Sullivan, Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's chief foreign policy adviser, whose emails from when he was a State Department aide were among those that were hacked.\par \par \uc2 ''This has gone from being a matter of curiosity, and a matter of politics, to being a national security issue,'' he added.\par \par \uc2 For his part, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  cast doubt on the conclusion that Russia was behind the hacking. ''I have no idea,'' he said. He said the ''sad thing'' is that ''with the genius we have in government, we don't even know who took the \uc2 Democratic National Committee\uc2  emails.''\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  then argued that if Russia, or any other foreign government, was behind the hacking, it showed just how little respect other nations had for the current administration.\par \par \uc2 ''President \uc2 Trump\uc2  would be so much better for U.S.-Russian relations'' than a President \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  said. ''I don't think Putin has any respect whatsoever for \uc2 Clinton\uc2 .''\par \par \uc2 Former Representative Pete Hoekstra of Michigan, a Republican who had served as chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, said Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  was right to keep hammering Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  on the subject of her private emails.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Hoekstra said he was untroubled by Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's goading of a foreign power, particularly in light of Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's use of a private server while she was secretary of state.\par \par \uc2 ''\uc2 Trump\uc2  is bringing up a fairly valid point: \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , with her personal email at the State Department, has put the Russians in a very enviable position,'' Mr. Hoekstra said. ''Most likely the Russians already have all that info on Hillary.''\par \par \uc2 But Representative Jason Chaffetz, a Utah Republican who led the House oversight committee that looked into Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's emails, was more critical. If Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's comments were meant literally, he said in an interview, ''I think he was absolutely wrong and out of line. I would never have said it that way, and I think it was ill-advised.''\par \par \uc2 If the remark was tongue-in-cheek, he added, it failed at political humor.\par \par \uc2 Find out what you need to know about the 2016 presidential race today, and get politics news updates via \uc2 Facebook\uc2 , \uc2 Twitter\uc2  and the First Draft newsletter.\par \par \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2  on Wednesday in Doral, Fla.

\par\par \uc2 OP-ED COLUMNIST\par \uc2 Editorial Desk; SECTA\par \b \uc2 Putin, \uc2 Trump\uc2  and Our \uc2 Election\b0\par\par\uc2 By NICHOLAS KRISTOF \par \uc2 892 \uc2 words\par \uc2 28 July 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 27\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Some foreign leaders settle for stealing billions of dollars. Russia's president, \uc2 Vladimir Putin\uc2 , may have wanted to steal something even more valuable: an American presidential \uc2 election\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 As our \uc2 election\uc2  takes a turn that could be drawn from a Cold War spy novel (except it would be too implausible), Putin has an obvious favorite in the race: \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2 . ''It's crystal clear to me'' that Putin favors \uc2 Trump\uc2 , says Michael McFaul, a Stanford professor who was ambassador to Russia until 2014. ''If I were Putin, I would rather deal with \uc2 Trump\uc2 , too, given the things he has said about foreign policy.''\par \par \uc2 Look, Democratic Party leaders exchanged inappropriate emails showing bias for \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  over Bernie Sanders, and a hacker's disclosure has properly triggered a ruckus. But that scandal pales beside an effort apparently by a foreign dictatorship to disrupt an American presidential \uc2 election\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 It also seems scandalous to me that \uc2 Trump\uc2  on Wednesday effectively invited Russia to hack into \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's computers for deleted emails from when she was secretary of state, saying at a press conference, ''Russia, if you're listening, I hope you're able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing.''\par \par \uc2 Yes, \uc2 Trump\uc2  is entertaining. But increasingly, the antonym of ''gravitas'' is ''\uc2 Trump\uc2 .'' \uc2 Clinton\uc2  could have responded by inviting Russia to hack into \uc2 Trump\uc2 's computers and release his tax returns; she didn't because the hack would be illegal and her plea would be unpresidential.\par \par \uc2 In his press conference, \uc2 Trump\uc2  also cast doubt on the idea that Russia hacked the \uc2 Democratic National Committee\uc2 's computers. ''It's probably not Russia,'' he said, suggesting it might be China, or ''some guy with a 200 I.Q.''\par \par \uc2 So let's go through the evidence.\par \par \uc2 America's intelligence agencies have assessed with ''high confidence'' that Russia's government was behind the hack, and private security companies have identified two Russian teams of hackers that were inside D.N.C. computers. One team is called Cozy Bear and is linked to the F.S.B., the successor to the K.G.B., and another is called Fancy Bear and is linked to the G.R.U., or Russian military intelligence. Cyber experts are very familiar with both Cozy Bear and Fancy Bear.\par \par \uc2 The next question is whether Russia was also behind the release of the stolen emails to \uc2 WikiLeaks\uc2 . Someone using the name Guccifer 2.0 claimed to be behind the hack, denied Russian involvement and claimed to be Romanian -- but wrote Romanian badly. ThreatConnect, a private security firm, issued a meticulous report showing that Guccifer used a Russia-based VPN (virtual private network) service and displayed other ''heavy traces of Russian activity.''\par \par \uc2 ''Guccifer 2.0 is a Russian propaganda effort,'' ThreatConnect concluded.\par \par \uc2 After talking to experts, I have the sense that there's considerable confidence that Russia is the culprit, but more doubt about whether Putin gave the order and about whether the aim was to benefit \uc2 Trump\uc2  or simply to create havoc.\par \par \uc2 ''I think the most likely explanation is that someone in Russian intelligence, probably very high up, decided to help \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2 ,'' said Benjamin Wittes, a security expert at the \uc2 Brookings Institution\uc2 , but he added that there's no solid evidence for this.\par \par \uc2 One reason for caution is that history shows that ''intelligence community'' is sometimes an oxymoron. In the 1980s, the United States accused Russia of conducting chemical warfare in Southeast Asia, citing ''yellow rain'' in jungles there. Years later, it turned out that this ''yellow rain'' may have actually been bee excrement.\par \par \uc2 Democrats should be particularly wary of hinting that \uc2 Trump\uc2  is some sort of conscious pawn of the Russians, or is controlled by Moscow through financial investments. It's true that his son Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  Jr. said in 2008 that ''we see a lot of money pouring in from Russia.'' But do you really think that if \uc2 Trump\uc2  were an agent he would have exaggerated his ties, as he did last year, saying of Putin, ''I got to know him very well''? In fact, \uc2 Trump\uc2  acknowledged Wednesday, he has never even met Putin.\par \par \uc2 The reason Moscow favors \uc2 Trump\uc2  isn't some conspiracy. It's simply that Putin dislikes \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , while \uc2 Trump\uc2 's combination of international ignorance and catastrophic policies would benefit Putin. In particular, \uc2 Trump\uc2 's public doubts about \uc2 NATO\uc2  renounce more than half a century of bipartisan orthodoxy on how to deal with Russia, and undermine the Western alliance that checks Putin.\par \par \uc2 One nightmare of security specialists is Russia provoking unrest among ethnic Russians in Estonia, Latvia or Lithuania and then using rioting as an excuse to intervene. \uc2 NATO\uc2  members would be obliged to respond, but frankly it's not clear that they would -- and \uc2 Trump\uc2 's loose rhetoric increases the risk of paralysis and a collapse of the alliance.\par \par \uc2 In that sense, \uc2 Trump\uc2  poses a national security risk to the West, and that's reason enough Putin would be thrilled to see him elected president.\par \par \uc2 I invite you to sign up for my free, twice-weekly email newsletter.

\par\par \uc2 Politics; SECT\par \b \uc2 What \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  Said About Russian Hacking and \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's Emails\b0\par\par\uc2 By THE NEW YORK TIMES \par \uc2 1,309 \uc2 words\par \uc2 28 July 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 The New York Times on the Web\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2  held a news conference Wednesday morning during which he challenged Russia to find \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's missing email correspondence and made extensive comments about United States-Russian relations. Here are highlights of what he said:\par \par \uc2 On allegations of Russian computer hacking and Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's emails\par \par \uc2 ''By the way, they hacked -- they probably have her 33,000 emails. I hope they do. They probably have her 33,000 emails that she lost and deleted because you'd see some beauties there. So let's see.''\par \par \uc2 ...\par \par \uc2 ''And that's why -- if it is Russia, nobody even knows this, it's probably China, or it could be somebody sitting in his bed. But it shows how weak we are, it shows how disrespected we are. Total -- assuming it's Russia or China or one of the major countries and competitors, it's a total sign of disrespect for our country. Putin and the leaders throughout the world have no respect for our country anymore and they certainly have no respect for our leader. So I know nothing about it. It's one of the most far-fetched I've ever heard.''\par \par \uc2 _____\par \par \uc2 On how he would approach the Russian president, \uc2 Vladimir Putin\par \par \uc2 ''I would treat \uc2 Vladimir Putin\uc2  firmly but there's nothing that I can think of that I'd rather do than have Russia friendly as opposed to the way they are right now so that we can go and knock out ISIS together with other people and with other countries. Wouldn't it be nice if we actually got along with people, wouldn't it be nice if we actually got along, as an example, with Russia? I'm all for it and let's go get ISIS because we have to get ISIS and we have to get them fast.''\par \par \uc2 _____\par \par \uc2 On releasing his tax returns\par \par \uc2 ''It depends on the audit. It depends on the audit, not a big deal. By the way, just so you understand, I've released my papers, 104 pages of documents. I built an unbelievable company, tremendous cash, tremendous company with some of the great assets of the world. You've seen it. You were all very disappointed when you saw it actually but that's O.K. Far, far greater than anybody ever thought. I have a great company. I built an unbelievable company but if you look there you'll see there's nothing in Russia.\par \par \uc2 ''And as far as the tax returns, as soon as the audits complete, like any lawyer would tell you, Greta Van Susteren she was going over it a while ago, she's a lawyer. She said well no lawyer would let somebody release a tax return when they're under audit. It's a routine audit. I've gone through audits, which I think is very unfair, for 15 years. I have friends that are very rich and never get audited. I'm audited every year. Maybe that's because of politics, who knows.''\par \par \uc2 _____\par \par \uc2 On Mr. Putin and Russia's alleged hacking of the \uc2 Democratic National Committee\uc2  email system\par \par \uc2 ''Why do I have to get involved with Putin? I have nothing to do with Putin. I've never spoken to him. I don't know anything about him other than he will respect me. He doesn't respect our president. And if it is Russia -- which it's probably not, nobody knows who it is -- but if it is Russia, it's really bad for a different reason, because it shows how little respect they have for our country, when they would hack into a major party and get everything. But it would be interesting to see -- I will tell you this -- Russia, if you're listening, I hope you're able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing. I think you will probably be rewarded mightily by our press. Let's see if that happens. That'll be next. Yes, sir.''\par \par \uc2 _____\par \par \uc2 On Putin's view of the United States and the presidential \uc2 election\par \par \uc2 ''I don't think he respects \uc2 Clinton\uc2 . I don't think Putin has any respect whatsoever for \uc2 Clinton\uc2 . I think he does respect me. And I hope I get along great with him. It's possible that we won't, Jeremy. I hope that we get along great with Putin because it would be great to have Russia with a good relationship.\par \par \uc2 ''Right now, we don't have a good relationship. Putin has said things over the last year that are really bad things. O.K.? He mentioned the ''N'' word one time. I was shocked to hear him mention the ''N'' word. You know what the ''N'' word is, right? He mentioned it. I was shocked.\par \par \uc2 ''He has a total lack of respect for President Obama. No. 1, he doesn't like him. And No. 2, he doesn't respect him. I think he's going to respect your president if I'm elected. And I hope he likes me.''\par \par \uc2 _____\par \par \uc2 On his relations with Russia\par \par \uc2 ''No, I have nothing to do with Russia, John. How many times do I have say that? Are you a smart man? I have nothing to with Russia, I have nothing to do with Russia.\par \par \uc2 ''And even -- for anything. What do I have to do with Russia? You know the closest I came to Russia, I bought a house a number of years ago in Palm Beach, Fla.\par \par \uc2 ''Palm Beach is a very expensive place. There was a man who went bankrupt and I bought the house for $40 million and I sold it to a Russian for $100 million including brokerage commissions. So I sold it. So I bought it for 40, I told it for 100 to a Russian. That was a number of years ago. I guess probably I sell condos to Russians, O.K.?\par \par \uc2 (QUESTION OFF-MIC)\par \par \uc2 ''Of course I can. I told you, other than normal stuff -- I buy a house if I sold it to a Russian. I have nothing to do with Russia. I said that Putin has much better leadership qualities than Obama, but who doesn't know that?\par \par \uc2 _____\par \par \uc2 On asking Russia to hack servers in the United States\par \par \uc2 ''No, it gives me no pause. If they have them, they have them. We might as well -- hey, you know what gives me more pause? That a person in our government, crooked \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  -- here's what gives me pause. Be quiet. I know you want to save her. That a person in our government, Katy, would delete or get rid of 33,000 emails. That gives me a big problem. After she gets a subpoena! She gets subpoenaed, and she gets rid of 33,000 emails? That gives me a problem. Now, if Russia or China or any other country has those emails, I mean, to be honest with you, I'd love to see them.''\par \par \uc2 _____\par \par \uc2 On business dealings with Russia\par \par \uc2 ''We wanted to; we were doing Miss Universe four or five years ago in Russia. It was a tremendous success. Very, very successful. And there were developers in Russia that wanted to put a lot of money into developments in Russia. And they wanted us to do it. But it never worked out.\par \par \uc2 ''Frankly I didn't want to do it for a couple of different reasons. But we had a major developer, particular, but numerous developers that wanted to develop property in Moscow and other places. But we decided not to do it.''\par \par \uc2 _____\par \par \uc2 On recognizing Crimea as a Russian territory\par \par \uc2 ''We'll be looking at that. Yeah, we'll be looking.''\par \par \uc2 Find out what you need to know about the 2016 presidential race today, and get politics news updates via \uc2 Facebook\uc2 , \uc2 Twitter\uc2  and the First Draft newsletter.\par \par \uc2 Document NYTF000020160728ec7s00070\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 National Desk; SECTA\par \b \uc2 Reagan's Assailant Is Ordered Released\b0\par\par\uc2 By GARDINER HARRIS; Mike McPhate contributed reporting from New York. \par \uc2 967 \uc2 words\par \uc2 28 July 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 17\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 WASHINGTON -- John W. Hinckley Jr., who tried to assassinate President Ronald Reagan in 1981, will be allowed to live permanently with his elderly mother in Williamsburg, Va., leaving the psychiatric hospital where he has been imprisoned for several decades, a federal judge ruled on Wednesday.\par \par \uc2 Judge Paul L. Friedman of the United States District Court for the District of Columbia wrote in his opinion that Mr. Hinckley, 61, no longer posed a danger to himself or others. The release should begin no sooner than Aug. 5, the judge said.\par \par \uc2 Although Mr. Hinckley has been living part time in Williamsburg for years, family and friends of Reagan's said they were outraged that he would be allowed to reside there permanently.\par \par \uc2 ''I think it's terribly sad and wrong,'' Patti Davis, one of Reagan's daughters, said in a telephone interview. In a blog post on her website, Ms. Davis wrote that she had long been haunted by the shooting.\par \par \uc2 ''If John Hinckley is haunted by anything, I think it's that he didn't succeed in his mission to assassinate the president,'' Ms. Davis wrote.\par \par \uc2 In a news conference on Wednesday, \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , the Republican presidential nominee, also denounced the release.\par \par \uc2 ''And by the way, David Hinckley should not have been freed, O.K.?'' Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  said. When someone said that the man's name was John Hinckley, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  corrected himself.\par \par \uc2 A spokeswoman for the Justice Department, which has consistently opposed Mr. Hinckley's appeals for greater freedom, said it was reviewing the ruling. A spokeswoman for the Secret Service, which sometimes secretly follows Mr. Hinckley while he is on supervised release, said the agency would not comment.\par \par \uc2 Since 2014, Judge Friedman has allowed Mr. Hinckley to have 17-day stays in Williamsburg, where he has voluntary jobs doing landscaping at a Unitarian church and working in the library and cafeteria of a psychiatric hospital. He has also taken up bowling, attends lectures and outdoor concerts, and exercises regularly at a community center.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Hinckley will have restrictions. He will have to work or volunteer at least three days a week, and if he fails to show up, his absence must be reported to the authorities. He must live with his mother for at least the first year and carry a cellphone that tracks his movements.\par \par \uc2 The judge forbade Mr. Hinckley from speaking to or contacting the news media, and he can drive unaccompanied only within a 30-mile radius of Williamsburg, although he can also drive by himself to monthly hospital appointments in the Washington area.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Hinckley was once psychotic and depressed. After seeing the 1976 film ''Taxi Driver,'' in which a disturbed man plots to assassinate a presidential candidate, he became fixated on Jodie Foster, who played a child prostitute in the film.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Hinckley began to identify with the main character in the film, Travis Bickle, played by Robert De Niro.\par \par \uc2 After Ms. Foster entered \uc2 Yale University\uc2 , Mr. Hinckley moved to New Haven to be close to her and left notes, letters and poems at her dormitory. Failing to win her affections, Mr. Hinckley stalked President \uc2 Jimmy Carter\uc2  and was eventually arrested on firearms charges. After the 1980 \uc2 election\uc2 , Mr. Hinckley stalked the newly elected President Reagan in an attempt to impress Ms. Foster.\par \par \uc2 On March 30, 1981, after more unsuccessful trips to New Haven, Mr. Hinckley wrote a letter to Ms. Foster describing his plan to kill Reagan. He waited outside the Washington Hilton Hotel for Reagan to arrive and waved at the president as he went inside to deliver a speech.\par \par \uc2 Forty minutes later, when Reagan emerged from the hotel, Mr. Hinckley crouched down and fired six shots, hitting four men: Reagan; James S. Brady, the White House press secretary; Timothy J. McCarthy, a Secret Service agent; and Thomas K. Delahanty, a Washington police officer. Mr. Brady sustained permanent brain damage and eventually died from his injuries in 2014.\par \par \uc2 A jury found Mr. Hinckley not guilty by reason of insanity, a decision that shocked the public and lawmakers across the country. He was sent for treatment to St. Elizabeths, a psychiatric hospital in Washington, where he has been confined ever since.\par \par \uc2 Judge Friedman ordered that Mr. Hinckley have no contact with Ms. Foster, or any members of Reagan's or Mr. Brady's families, or those of his other victims. He is not allowed to be in the same area as current presidents, vice presidents, members of Congress or other senior members of an administration, and he is not allowed to have \uc2 Facebook\uc2 , \uc2 Twitter\uc2  or other social media accounts without the unanimous consent of his treatment team.\par \par \uc2 The judge said that if Mr. Hinckley violated the terms of his leave, he could be returned to the hospital.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Hinckley has various physical ailments, including arthritis and high blood pressure. He attempted suicide several times, the last in 1983, but has been largely free of severe mental illness for more than 20 years, according to his doctors.\par \par \uc2 Kenneth M. Duberstein, who was briefly Reagan's chief of staff, said he was astonished by the judge's ruling. ''The consequences of trying to kill the leader of the free world should be prison for life,'' Mr. Duberstein said.\par \par \uc2 Dan Gross, the president of the Brady Campaign and Center to Prevent Gun Violence, said that ''all Americans should be outraged that it will be just as easy for Jim's would-be killer to buy a gun today as it was 35 years ago.''\par \par \uc2 John W. Hinckley Jr. in 2003. Since 2014, he has been allowed 17-day stays in Williamsburg, Va., where his mother lives.

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 PHILADELPHIA -- He spoke of desiring her: her thick blond hair, her flowery white skirt, her magnetic personality.\par \par \uc2 He was almost titillating as he recalled chasing after her and getting close enough to ''touch her back.''\par \par \uc2 He used intimate details to reveal her feelings about his three marriage proposals.\par \par \uc2 Never before has a spouse talked about a presidential nominee at a political convention quite like \uc2 Bill \uc2 Clinton\uc2  described \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  here on Tuesday night. Then again, a man has never talked about a woman in this context before.\par \par \uc2 It had always been political wives who shared personal anecdotes to warm up their husbands, especially in the eyes of female voters. Those details were rarely very emotional, though, for fear of feminizing the nominees. Future presidents did not want Americans to hear about them crying.\par \par \uc2 From the dais of the Democratic convention, Mr. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  talked about Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  crying, and so much more.\par \par \uc2 In doing so, Mr. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  began redefining the American presidency as a female institution.\par \par \uc2 A \uc2 Clinton\uc2  win in November would obviously give the country a female president. But for 227 years, the presidency has been associated with stereotypically male qualities -- strength, resolve, fearlessness -- and the embodiment of power in a deeply patriarchal political system. American attitudes about the presidency would not change overnight with her \uc2 election\uc2 , and certainly would not with one speech by a spouse. But Mr. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  was clearly trying to nudge voters to see a woman's strengths and experiences as a natural fit for the presidency.\par \par \uc2 He did not shy away from portraying Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  as a girlfriend, wife, and mother -- the first time, surely, that the moment a presidential nominee's water broke was recounted to a rapt convention audience and millions more at home. These were the characterizations that her advisers avoided in her 2008 campaign for fear she would appear weak. Mr. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  argued in favor of her candidacy by highlighting qualities traditionally associated with women, such as tenderness and compassion and loyalty. Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  ''calls you when you're sick, when your kid's in trouble, or when there is a death in the family,'' he said.\par \par \uc2 And as he shared details of their courtship for a good eight minutes, he imbued Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  with the aura of a sexual being. Not even Jackie Kennedy did that for Jack.\par \par \uc2 ''In the spring of 1971, I met a girl,'' Mr. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  began, sounding like a narrator in an old Philip Roth novel or like a confessional letter to Esquire. ''After the class, I followed her out, intending to introduce myself,'' he continued, recalling that his confidence abandoned him. ''Somehow, I knew this would not be just another tap on the shoulder, that I might be starting something I couldn't stop.''\par \par \uc2 Not everyone appreciated the former president's lingering over his early attraction to the 23-year-old Hillary Rodham. Rachel Maddow, the MSNBC host, called it ''shocking and weird,'' and suggested it diminished Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's many accomplishments.\par \par \uc2 ''It was a controversial way to start, honestly, talking about the girl, a girl, leading with this long story about him being attracted to an unnamed girl and thinking about whether he was starting something he couldn't finish, building her whole political story, for the whole first half of the speech around her marriage to him,'' Ms. Maddow said.\par \par \uc2 But Mr. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  clearly wanted to tell Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's story through the lens of their courtship and 40-year marriage.\par \par \uc2 This was an audacious strategy, given that their marriage is one of the most complicated and contentious in modern politics. One of his fiercest declarations -- ''she will never quit when the going gets tough, she will never quit on you'' -- could not help but conjure up his history of infidelities. In doing so, he humanized a marriage that has baffled many Americans while also reminding people of his philandering and her compromises.\par \par \uc2 The approach was ''a risky one given the fact that the speaker has famously not maintained Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  as the sole object of his sexual desire in the ensuing 45 years since she first caught his eye,'' said \uc2 Katherine Jellison\uc2 , a professor of history at Ohio University who focuses on women and gender.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's bet was that by talking so personally about Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , voters would envision qualities that they want in a president. He also hoped people would see through what Mr. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  called the ''cartoon'' image of Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  as a dishonest and untrustworthy figure. A majority of American voters see her that way, according to polls, an image that Mr. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  links to Republicans and other political enemies, as well as the news media. He used his speech to offer a loving and layered portrait instead, recalling how Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  struggled to leave their daughter at college on move-in day, and how they cried together on Tuesday morning over the death of an old friend.\par \par \uc2 Whether his speech causes people to see Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  differently -- or makes people uncomfortable with the \uc2 Clinton\uc2  marriage all over again -- will become clearer in time, not only through polls but also in the chatter among voters.\par \par \uc2 And while Ms. Maddow and others offered a critique of Mr. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's portrait, clearly uncomfortable with the framing of the first female major party nominee as an attractive girl, the speech seemed less directed at them and more at the voters who cannot warm to Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 After all, polls already show that Americans believe Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  is up to the job; they just are not sure they like her enough to elect her to do it.\par \par \uc2 Clinton\uc2  haters will surely be unmoved. And skeptics may have a hard time absorbing anything new about Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  after living with her in the public spotlight for more than 20 years.\par \par \uc2 Yet there is something undeniably endearing about a husband celebrating ''that big laugh of hers,'' as Mr. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  did, or admitting that his wife took a big gamble moving to Arkansas and marrying him.\par \par \uc2 ''His deeply personal language also struck and moved me, and especially his seeing her as a sexual person and someone he desired as well as a highly intelligent person, capable of getting things done,'' said Carol Gilligan, an expert in gender studies and a professor at New York University. She added: ''It also struck me as profoundly democratic: she's a human being -- not a god -- living in a woman's body.''\par \par \uc2 Political wives often make their husbands sound like saints. Mr. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  made Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  sound likable, which is no small thing in politics.\par \par \uc2 ''I married my best friend,'' he said. ''I have lived a long, full, blessed life. It really took off when I met and fell in love with that girl in the spring of 1971.''\par \par \uc2 His implication was obvious. America would really take off as well, if voters would just fall in love with that girl, too.\par \par \uc2 Find out what you need to know about the 2016 presidential race today, and get politics news updates via \uc2 Facebook\uc2 , \uc2 Twitter\uc2  and the First Draft newsletter.\par \par \uc2 Left, Bill and Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  celebrating his victory in a 1982 Democratic runoff \uc2 election\uc2  in the Arkansas governor's race. Right, Mr. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  during his appearance on Tuesday at the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia, where he spoke intimately and at length about his relationship with his wife.

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Sarah Silverman has delivered many memorable lines in her career, but for now, she is perhaps most closely associated with these words she spoke onstage at the Democratic National Convention on Monday night: ''Can I just say, to the Bernie or Bust people: You're being ridiculous.''\par \par \uc2 During the primary season, Ms. Silverman, the outspoken, Emmy Award-winning comedian and star of films like ''I Smile Back,'' had been an enthusiastic supporter of Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont. ''This past year, I've been feeling the Bern,'' she said from the stage, adding, ''Relax, I put some cream on it.'' She went on to express support for \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , calling for harmony within her party. ''I will vote for Hillary with gusto, as I continue to be inspired and moved to action by the ideals set forth by Bernie, who will never stop fighting for us.''\par \par \uc2 But many delegates were in no laughing mood, and some who backed Mr. Sanders booed and jeered the convention speakers throughout the afternoon and evening. When Ms. Silverman and Senator Al Franken of Minnesota came out that night to introduce a musical performance by Paul Simon, the crowd began to grow restless and break into chants of ''Bernie!'' Neither Mr. Franken's counter-chant (''Hillary!'') nor Ms. Silverman's (''Unity!'') could quell the protests, so Ms. Silverman followed with her rebuke, now famous, which drew applause at the Wells Fargo Center (as well as passionate tweets, both pro and con, from home viewers.)\par \par \uc2 Speaking by telephone from New Hampshire on Tuesday, Ms. Silverman talked about her convention experience and her thoughts about Mr. Sanders and Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 . These are edited excerpts from that conversation.\par \par \uc2 How were you invited to participate in the convention?\par \par \uc2 Jane Sanders\uc2  emailed me directly, and also the D.N.C. reached out to my publicist. I thought: Yeah. One thing they don't do right at these conventions is their language isn't accessible to everybody. Most people who vote don't know what \uc2 Citizens United\uc2  means, or what ''oligarchy'' means. It's important to talk in plain English. Part of \uc2 Trump\uc2 's success is he talks in simple language and he just says things like, ''Everything's going to be great'' and ''We're going to be great'' and ''It's all going to be great.'' That's what a lot of politicians do. They speak in vague terms so that they can get the mass appeal.\par \par \uc2 Did you see your speech as an attempt to soothe supporters of Mr. Sanders, who might still have raw feelings from the primaries?\par \par \uc2 There's a lot of heartbreak in it. But the truth of the matter is, it's so simple. Look, Bernie ran as a Democrat, so as to not split the vote. I voted for Ralph Nader when Gore quote-unquote lost to Bush. He didn't want to do that. The Bernie or Bust people, the people who are like, Bernie or nothing, I don't know what their long-term plan is or what their perfect scenario could possibly be. I couldn't love Bernie more, and to help him at this point is to make sure he has an ally in office. People who change the world aren't always the president. I don't think he needs to be president, and I can't wait to see what Obama does out of office. This movement has never been something that he planned on ending with the \uc2 election\uc2 . And I'm absolutely voting for Hillary. You'd be crazy not to.\par \par \uc2 Knowing how much booing and raucousness there had been in those first hours of the convention, how did you feel about having to go out and face that crowd?\par \par \uc2 I focused on the audience at home, which is usually not what I like to do. But the loudest voice doesn't mean that it's the right voice or the majority voice at all. It was almost like the \uc2 Red Sox\uc2  and the \uc2 Yankees\uc2  -- there wasn't a common sense to it. I understand the passion behind Bernie. No one's more passionate than me. I just don't see it as a defeat that he doesn't get to be president. He's so effective anyway.\par \par \uc2 And in the moment that you addressed the Bernie or Bust people ----\par \par \uc2 I wasn't going to say the ''ridiculous'' thing. They told us to stretch, and I just saw these people going: ''Boo! Bernie!'' Whatever.\par \par \uc2 When you're a comic, and you do material that you mean in one way, and people take it in another -- like years ago, I would do a lot of racial stuff, and I meant it in a very bleeding-heart liberal way, ultimately. By being the idiot.There were people who would take that literally, and we would call those mouth-full-of-blood laughs. They're the laughs you don't want. And those people cheering for Bernie when he came out -- the whole place was so inspired; the whole room was amazing. But that little section of quote-unquote Bernie Bros or whatever, it's the fans you don't want. The fundamentalists of any group, including fans of Bernie or fans of Hillary or fans of anyone are a bummer. So that's just a given. It's not that big a deal.\par \par \uc2 Did you feel as if you were addressing them as a comedian would knock down a heckler?\par \par \uc2 No, no -- it didn't feel like heckles. It was such chaos. You can't hear, really, anything that's going on at all. It just is a really loud white noise. It's too much to take in or hear any individual voices. It wasn't a heckler return. It was something that's been burbling in me.\par \par \uc2 Was there anything you wanted to do in your speech that the \uc2 Democratic National Committee\uc2  wouldn't allow?\par \par \uc2 At the very beginning, when Al said, ''I'm Al Franken, and this past year I've been hashtag-I'm With Her,'' and I was going to say, ''And I'm Sarah Silverman, and this past year I've been with the possibly agnostic Jew.'' Because you know the Right is going to use these emails to try to separate them. It's what they want so badly. I just felt like, let the comedian defuse it and just address the elephant in the room. But they were like, no. And they are right. They're right. But I get so indignant. At least I'm aware, and awareness brings change, so maybe I'll be less obnoxious.\par \par \uc2 What kind of feedback did you get in the immediate aftermath, coming off the stage?\par \par \uc2 I have not been on \uc2 Twitter\uc2  or social media yet. I will absolutely \uc2 Google\uc2  myself. I've been nonstop, and I'm sick and I'm weak and I'm visiting my parents. So mostly, I've had a ton of feedback from my friends and family, from emails and texts. It's been very positive, but they're all people who love me, so I don't know. The people from the D.N.C. were very happy.\par \par \uc2 If people who still support Mr. Sanders say that they feel you've sold them out somehow, how would you feel?\par \par \uc2 That's their opinion. I learned the hard way, through comedy, to defend what you're putting out there is silly. Once you put it out there, it's for other people to experience, and you can't control it. I thought a lot about it, and it seems so clear to me that it's the right thing to do. If they love Bernie so much, why are they disregarding his wishes? He clearly is backing Hillary. Any backlash that I'm a sellout, that's theirs to have and hold. It has nothing to do with me. If you don't get Zen about it, you could really go crazy. My mom would always watch MSNBC and get so riled up. I would always tell her, ''Mom, sometimes you have to change the channel. Watch a 'Bones' or a 'Law & Order' or something.''\par \par \uc2 (PHOTOGRAPH BY JIM WILSON/THE NEW YORK TIMES) \par \par \uc2 Document NYTF000020160728ec7s0006d\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 ON WASHINGTON\par \uc2 National Desk; SECTA\par \b \uc2 Gun Laws, Long Avoided, Return to the Agenda\b0\par\par\uc2 By CARL HULSE \par \uc2 1,132 \uc2 words\par \uc2 28 July 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 1\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 PHILADELPHIA -- After treating gun control as political poison for two decades, Democrats led by \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  are again vigorously championing new gun restrictions as a central element of their campaigns.\par \par \uc2 It is a pronounced shift. Stung by the loss of the House in 1994 after they enacted an assault rifle ban, and wary of the proven influence of the \uc2 National Rifle Association\uc2 , many Democrats have shied away from gun control proposals for fear of provoking an electoral backlash with little to show for it. Democrats couldn't race away from a discussion of gun laws fast enough.\par \par \uc2 But a string of mass shootings involving high-powered weapons, rising anxiety about domestic terrorism, and killings of and by police officers have emboldened Democrats. They say the shootings are intensifying support for gun control, elevating weapons policy to a top-tier issue, with particularly strong appeal to suburban female voters.\par \par \uc2 Citing polls showing strong support for new restrictions even among gun owners, gun control advocates believe the public is open to expanded background checks, new limits on gun purchases and more scrutiny of gun manufacturers and dealers. They intend to enthusiastically press the case in races across the country.\par \par \uc2 ''For the first time, this is a winning issue in the general \uc2 election\uc2 ,'' said Senator Christopher S. Murphy, the Connecticut Democrat who has become a leading proponent of gun control since the Sandy Hook Elementary School shootings in his state in 2012.\par \par \uc2 Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  is expected to identify stiffer gun control laws as a priority in her acceptance speech at the Democratic National Convention on Thursday night, setting up a clear contrast with \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , who frequently notes his N.R.A. endorsement.\par \par \uc2 A top N.R.A. official was given a prime speaking slot at the Republican convention last week, a sign of the ties between Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  and the organization.\par \par \uc2 A bloc of Democratic convention time Wednesday night was set aside specifically to highlight gun issues, with emotional appearances by survivors and relatives of those killed in the mass shootings at the Connecticut elementary school, the Pulse nightclub in Orlando, Fla., and the Emanuel A.M.E. Church in Charleston, S.C.\par \par \uc2 ''I think the American public is at the point where they've seen enough,'' said Maura Healey, the attorney general of Massachusetts, who last week moved to expand her state's ban on the sale of assault-style weapons.\par \par \uc2 Ms. Healey spoke at a session organized by Americans for Responsible Solutions, the group founded as a counter to the N.R.A. by Gabrielle Giffords and her husband, Mark Kelly. She is the former Arizona congresswoman grievously wounded in a 2011 assassination attempt that killed six others. The group has had a big presence at the convention, with a rally and other events.\par \par \uc2 Ms. Giffords took the stage on Tuesday night at a private concert featuring the rock group Drive-By Truckers, which included a song about a 2015 mass shooting at Umpqua Community College in Oregon on its latest album, to urge those attending to rally behind stronger gun control.\par \par \uc2 ''Stopping gun violence takes great courage,'' Ms. Giffords, who still struggles with speaking because of her injuries, told the admiring crowd. ''Fight, fight, fight. The nation's counting on you.''\par \par \uc2 Her group has criticized Senator Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire, one of the most endangered Republicans on the ballot this year, for opposing expanded background checks. Gun control is likely to be a line of attack in many other Senate and House races.\par \par \uc2 The renewed Democratic focus on gun control has not escaped the notice of the N.R.A. The organization is taking it seriously given the significant money behind it from the Giffords group as well as from former Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg of New York, a billionaire who funds gun control advocacy through the organization Everytown for Gun Safety.\par \par \uc2 An N.R.A. spokeswoman, Jennifer Baker, said the American public would ultimately reject added gun control because Democrats, while cloaking their gun agenda in the language of ''common sense,'' really want to go much further.\par \par \uc2 ''The political elites and D.C. politicians don't understand Middle America,'' she said. ''They don't understand that voters support the Second Amendment and the individual right to self-protection.''\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 NRA\uc2  says that it will on Thursday, in a move timed to Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's speech, begin running a new ad that says she would put an individual's right to self-defense at risk.\par \par \uc2 Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's advocacy of stronger gun restrictions was viewed skeptically by some during the Democratic primary campaign because it was one issue where she could get to the left of Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, who had opposed some gun control measures as a member of the House. Conversely, in her 2008 primary campaign against \uc2 Barack Obama\uc2 , she tried to appeal to gun owners and raised suggestions that he was not as committed to gun rights as she was.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Murphy and other gun control advocates say Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  is firmly committed to making gun control a major theme of her campaign, providing a mandate to act on the issue should she prevail in November.\par \par \uc2 ''This issue is a core value for \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  and it is good politics,'' Mr. Murphy said.\par \par \uc2 Her choice of running mate, Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia, reinforced the perception that gun safety was going to be a mainstay of the campaign. Mr. Kaine, the former governor of the state, is a longtime advocate of stricter gun laws who moved to bar the mentally ill from acquiring guns after the 2007 mass shooting at \uc2 Virginia Tech\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Virginia figures into the rising Democratic call on guns in another way. Democrats and analysts say they first began to realize the atmosphere had changed when the longtime \uc2 Clinton\uc2  ally \uc2 Terry McAuliffe\uc2  was elected governor while pushing new gun controls. His campaign manager in that successful run was Robby Mook, now the manager of Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's presidential campaign.\par \par \uc2 Given deep Republican resistance in Congress, major changes in gun laws anytime soon seem unlikely. But the convention is demonstrating that Democrats have recovered their voice on the issue.\par \par \uc2 Find out what you need to know about the 2016 presidential race today, and get politics news updates via \uc2 Facebook\uc2 , \uc2 Twitter\uc2  and the First Draft newsletter.\par \par \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  joined President Obama on the podium Wednesday night at the Democratic convention. He said Republicans were fanning ''resentments and blame and hate and anger.''

\par\par \uc2 UNBUTTONED\par \uc2 Style Desk; SECTD\par \b \uc2 Changing the Rules of Power Dressing\b0\par\par\uc2 By VANESSA FRIEDMAN \par \uc2 1,535 \uc2 words\par \uc2 28 July 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 1\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 When \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  takes the stage at the Wells Fargo Center in Philadelphia on Thursday to formally accept the nomination as the Democratic candidate for president of the United States, she will make history and automatically become a role model for women in a way that goes beyond all of her achievements thus far.\par \par \uc2 Over the months until the general \uc2 election\uc2  (and perhaps beyond), she will be scrutinized in evermore exacting detail, not just for her economic platform and her emails, but also for her body language, her eating habits, her relationships. And, yes, her clothes.\par \par \uc2 This is life in the contemporary political arena, where who a candidate is as a person -- the choices she makes every day -- is as picked over as her positions, in part because those are choices we all share.\par \par \uc2 Most of us don't have to decide on sanctions against Syria, or whether to try to reinstate the Glass-Steagall Act, but we all have to get dressed in the morning. That's the sweet spot where public politician and private person meet.\par \par \uc2 It's not an embarrassment, or an affront. It's reality. And right now it is an enormous opportunity: to redefine what being a female leader means, on every level. There is finally critical mass to seize it.\par \par \uc2 For years \uc2 Angela Merkel\uc2 , the chancellor of Germany, with her palette of Pantone jackets and black pants, has set the tone, tweaking the male uniform by disaggregating tops and bottoms and expanding the color range while keeping within a traditional framework.\par \par \uc2 Effectively she was buying into the idea that for a woman to wield power in what was historically a man's world, she had to pretty much dress like a man -- but brighter!\par \par \uc2 After all, the only alternative Western role model was Margaret Thatcher. But post-power, her skirt suits, pussy-bow blouses and hair-sprayed bouffant calcified into caricature.\par \par \uc2 Now, however, between Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  and \uc2 Theresa May\uc2 , Britain's new prime minister (and to a certain extent, \uc2 Nicola Sturgeon\uc2 , the first minister of Scotland), two more women are in the public eye, not as spouses of world leaders, but as the leaders themselves -- or the potential leaders. And they are, quietly but unquestionably, changing the rules about what it means to look like a president or prime minister.\par \par \uc2 Or, as Ivanka \uc2 Trump\uc2  said at the Republican convention, ''C.E.O. of the country.'' Or simply C.E.O.\par \par \uc2 It doesn't have to mean looking like a man in female colors.\par \par \uc2 Ms. May, who took office earlier this month, is the starkest proponent of this. She has been entirely unabashed about her own interest in fashion, especially shoes, from leopard-print kitten heels to lipstick-print ballet flats and patent leather over-the-knee boots, worn to greet the president of Mexico during a trip to Buckingham Palace.\par \par \uc2 At the Women in the World summit last October, in an interview on stage with \uc2 Tina Brown\uc2 , Ms. May said: ''I'm a woman, I like clothes. One of the challenges for women in politics, in business, in all areas of working life, is to be ourselves, and to say you can be clever and like clothes.''\par \par \uc2 She told the \uc2 BBC\uc2  radio program Desert Island Discs that if she were cast away, her ''luxury item'' would be a lifetime subscription to \uc2 Vogue\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 She has refused to admit that caring about fashion is irreconcilable with caring about, say, nuclear policy, and in doing so she is setting a precedent that allows women to use clothes to express a facet of their persona that may otherwise be denied, without it undermining expectations.\par \par \uc2 Not to mention giving permission for girls and young women to expect that just because they want to wear something that looks less like corporate armor and more like high style, it does not mean they are not highly intelligent and serious people.\par \par \uc2 Indeed, an oft-repeated story these days involves Ms. May meeting a young woman in the House of Commons who was wearing a trendy pair of shoes. ''I said I liked them, and she said my shoes were the reason she became involved in politics,'' Ms. May said.\par \par \uc2 The prime minister has even indicated that fashion may be a political advantage, calling her shoes an ''icebreaker.'' (This parallels similar stories from the former Secretary of State \uc2 Madeleine K. Albright\uc2 , who wrote an entire book, ''Read My Pins,'' about her strategic use of jewelry, which she called ''part of my personal diplomatic arsenal'' during her time in \uc2 Bill \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's cabinet.)\par \par \uc2 Of all of Ms. May's looks, her shoes have received the most attention. But to me, certain dresses have stood out: a navy Roland Mouret with an asymmetric neckline to speak at the Conservative Party Conference last year; a purple sheath when it was announced that she was one of two women left in the party leadership contest.\par \par \uc2 They break the traditional divide between, say, first lady and first person (i.e., \uc2 Michelle Obama\uc2  and Mrs. Merkel), in which historically first ladies wore dresses, and women in the business of governing wore, well, the pants. And the jackets.\par \par \uc2 There have been exceptions to this rule, most notably in South America, where women have held more power positions that they have in Europe and the United States. The former Argentine president, Cristina Fern\u225\'00\'E1ndez de Kirchner, for example, was known for her lace and floral frocks.\par \par \uc2 Even so, women like the embattled Brazilian President \uc2 Dilma Rousseff\uc2  and the Chilean President Michelle Bachelet tend to the Merkel school of dress: a uniform of colorful jackets and straight skirts or trousers.\par \par \uc2 Indeed, you can see it in the contrast between Ivanka \uc2 Trump\uc2 , the female power player of the \uc2 Trump\uc2  campaign, and Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 ; Mrs. Obama and Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts. Both Ms. \uc2 Trump\uc2  and Mrs. Obama (much as they may cringe at the comparison) wore neat, round-necked dresses during the recent conventions, Ms. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's, sleeveless and Mrs. Obama's, cap-sleeved.\par \par \uc2 Mrs. Obama arguably established this model, abandoning the first-lady-in-skirt-suits model generally adopted by both Laura and \uc2 Barbara Bush\uc2  as well as \uc2 Nancy Reagan\uc2 , and using a dress to project a less fussy, traditional persona and her right to bare arms.\par \par \uc2 But Ms. Warren almost always sports a sleek jewel-toned jacket over a round-necked black shirt and black trousers. And Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  has declared allegiance to trouser suits, the ones she settled on when she began her political career after the White House. As first lady, she tended toward the pastel and the classic and the skirt, but when she began her Senate campaign, she wore only black trouser suits.\par \par \uc2 And though that soon gave way to tone-on-tone colors, they have become the symbol of the before and after stages in her life: from behind-the-scenes power, wife and helpmeet to candidate in her own right.\par \par \uc2 Even within this more Merkel-like continuum, though, Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  has been branching out, wearing leather (Leather! When was the last time you saw a would-be president in leather that did not involve him standing on the deck of an aircraft carrier?) and beading, from both lesser-known names and designer labels, including Ralph Lauren and \uc2 Giorgio Armani\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 ''I think America, and the electorate, is finally ready to embrace that, the idea of women politicians wearing something that is fun and feminine, without it being an issue,'' said Lyn Paolo, the costume designer for ''Scandal'' and ''How to Get Away With Murder.'' ''It's about time. And I am really proud of her that she is trying new things.''\par \par \uc2 Admittedly, it is unlikely that on Thursday night Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  will try something too far out there. As Tammy Haddad, a consultant and the former MSNBC political director, said, when it comes to convention dressing, the best practice is to choose your clothes ''like your running mate: Do no harm and pick something you are comfortable in.'' Also an outfit in which you can easily raise your arms.\par \par \uc2 And certainly, it's easier to depart from expectations after you've won than it is to rock the boat beforehand. And everyone's focus should be on Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's words, her clothes just a useful tool to support them.\par \par \uc2 Either way, however, we are edging into a time when it is possible to conceive of an era in which women not only run the world (Sorry, could not end this without the de rigueur nod to Beyonc\u233\'00\'E9), but also don't have to don mufti to do it.\par \par \uc2 Imagine that.\par \par \uc2 Continue following our fashion and lifestyle coverage on \uc2 Facebook\uc2  (Styles and Modern Love), \uc2 Twitter\uc2  (Styles, Fashion and Weddings) and \uc2 Instagram\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , the Democratic presidential candidate, in Las Vegas this month. She has favored trouser suits in tone-on-tone colors.

\par\par \uc2 National Desk; SECTA\par \b \uc2 Divisions Linger at Convention, but Both Parties Have Faced Worse Infighting\b0\par\par\uc2 By ADAM NAGOURNEY; Yamiche Alcindor contributed reporting. \par \uc2 1,336 \uc2 words\par \uc2 28 July 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 12\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 PHILADELPHIA -- For all the noise, demonstrations, walkouts and silent protests, the divisions on display here as Democrats nominated \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  for president do not appear to present a major threat to her candidacy, paling in contrast to intramural battles that have doomed nominees in the past and that threaten \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2  today.\par \par \uc2 Even as Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , the Republican presidential nominee, has sought to take advantage of the acrimony by appealing directly to the supporters of Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's campaign has methodically used the first three days of this convention to win over those supporters.\par \par \uc2 Almost on the hour, the lights in the convention hall have dimmed to present ''\uc2 Trump\uc2  in His Own Words,'' a series of short video clips that show Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  offering contentious views on, for example, women and pregnancy in the workplace, advertisements clearly aimed at Sanders backers at the gathering.\par \par \uc2 ''I don't think it's going to be a permanent division,'' said Gov. Jerry Brown of California, a Democrat who lost his own bitter primary campaign for president against \uc2 Bill \uc2 Clinton\uc2  in 1992 and whose state delegation has been a hotbed of Sanders support. ''The stakes are high. The issues are very sharp. There will be a real convergence around the core ideas of the campaign.''\par \par \uc2 Despite a modest walkout after the roll call and a march on the convention hall by Sanders supporters as Mr. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  spoke on Tuesday, the convention has offered each night a broad cross-section of the party leadership that has allied behind Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 : speeches of support from President Obama, Vice President \uc2 Joseph R. Biden Jr\uc2 ., Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Howard Dean, whose 2004 candidacy for president recalls the one Mr. Sanders ran.\par \par \uc2 ''The Sanders people walked out last night -- there were less than 100 of them!'' Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the Senate minority leader, said.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Sanders was given a prime-time speech to make the case to his supporters that it was time to rally behind Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 . At the behest of the \uc2 Clinton\uc2  campaign, he moved to nominate her by acclamation to make it appear unanimous, just as she had done for \uc2 Barack Obama\uc2  in 2008. Even before the convention began, polls showed that a substantial majority of Mr. Sanders's backers said they would vote for Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  over Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , and if history is any guide, those numbers will only grow as \uc2 Election\uc2  Day approaches.\par \par \uc2 Todd Gitlin, a historian, said both parties have over the years faced divisions that were deeper and that festered through \uc2 Election\uc2  Day, including when Hubert Humphrey emerged from a Democratic primary contest with Eugene McCarthy and \uc2 Robert F. Kennedy\uc2  to lose to Richard M. Nixon in 1968, as well as when Barry Goldwater, after a divided Republican convention four years earlier, lost to Lyndon B. Johnson.\par \par \uc2 The current Republican Party may also fall into that category, given how many powerful Republicans have refused to back Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 . ''In 1968, the cleavage in the party was far deeper than it is now,'' Mr. Gitlin said. ''The hatred in the streets between the Humphrey supporters and the supporters of Kennedy and McCarthy was so intense. People like me didn't vote. I don't think we are looking at anything like that today.''\par \par \uc2 Which is not to say that this is going to be an easy walk down the aisle. In interviews, Democrats said they worried less about Sanders supporters voting for Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  than about them not turning out at all, or casting votes for, say, the Libertarian Party or Green Party candidates. ''I think there will be some loss of votes to third-party candidates,'' Stanley Greenberg, a Democratic pollster, said.\par \par \uc2 Former President George Bush has long blamed his re-\uc2 election\uc2  defeat in 1992 on the third-party candidacy of \uc2 Ross Perot\uc2 . Ralph Nader, who ran for president in 2000 on a third-party line, cost Al Gore, a Democrat, the \uc2 election\uc2  against Mr. Bush's son, in the view of many party members.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Sanders's support for Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  crystallized only recently. Well into the summer, he was still making a vigorous case against her -- on issues like trade and what he described as her sympathies to Wall Street -- drawing loud cheers and hardening opposition to Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  at his rallies. ''Long after it was clear he was not going to be a nominee, he was attacking her as an instrument of Wall Street,'' Mr. Greenberg said.\par \par \uc2 The reconciliation was no doubt complicated even more this week when \uc2 Gov. Terry McAuliffe\uc2  of Virginia, a longtime adviser to the Clintons, strongly suggested to an interviewer that Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  would change her position again on the Trans-Pacific Partnership Treaty and try to put it in effect once she was in the White House. Mr. Sanders has made opposition to the treaty, a pact with the United States and 11 other Pacific Rim nations, a central part of his campaign, forcing Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , who once supported the treaty, to publicly disavow it.\par \par \uc2 In this context, even a plea from Mr. Sanders to his supporters to embrace Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  may not be enough, at least for some of them.\par \par \uc2 ''She really needs to do actual concrete things to show that she recognizes what a dire situation our country and world is in,'' said Lisa Flythe, a Sanders delegate from Brooklyn who works as a customer-service representative. ''She needs to take concrete actions to enact a progressive agenda from workers' rights to eliminating T.P.P.''\par \par \uc2 At one point on Wednesday night, Sanders supporters, wearing green shirts and scattered across the hall, broke into loud chants of ''No more war,'' drowning out Leon E. Panetta, who was the director of the Central Intelligence Agency and the defense secretary under Mr. Obama, as he praised Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's foreign policy credentials.\par \par \uc2 Still, some of Mr. Sanders's supporters said that given the choice, they were ready to support her. ''I think it's appropriate to tell the Bernie supporters to support Hillary because of the alternative,'' said Taz Tally, a Democratic delegate from Homer, Alaska, ''and in my view, if you choose not to vote, it's basically a vote for Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , which is scary.''\par \par \uc2 Governor Brown, who endorsed Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  in the final days of the Democratic primary in California, said he did not think people who voted for Mr. Sanders would support Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 ''\uc2 Trump\uc2  is too antithetical to anything that Sanders people talk about,'' he said. ''There's a similarity on trade, but immigration, the N.R.A., \uc2 Trump\uc2  is a real outlier. And while he picked up the nomination of the Republican Party, he's not close to the mainstream that would make crossover likely from Democrats to Republicans.''\par \par \uc2 In the end, the party divisions appear to be, as they have been through much of the campaign, as generational as they are ideological. ''There will continue to be a hard left, some of whom are na\u239\'00\'EFve,'' Mr. Gitlin, the historian, said, referring to Sanders backers. ''They are young. This is their first crusade. They feel betrayed. They were true believers: They believed that Bernie was the man and Bernie was transformative. They were in this for victory. The feeling of betrayal is very real.''\par \par \uc2 Find out what you need to know about the 2016 presidential race today, and get politics news updates via \uc2 Facebook\uc2 , \uc2 Twitter\uc2  and the First Draft newsletter.\par \par \uc2 Top, supporters of Senator Bernie Sanders and others on Day 2 of the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia.

\par\par \uc2 National Desk; SECTA\par \b \uc2 A Chance for Future Stars to Emerge\b0\par\par\uc2 By MICHAEL D. SHEAR \par \uc2 1,351 \uc2 words\par \uc2 28 July 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 11\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 PHILADELPHIA -- Twelve years ago Wednesday in Boston, it was Senator \uc2 John Kerry\uc2 's presidential convention. But it was \uc2 Barack Obama\uc2 's night.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Obama, then a little-known state senator in Illinois, delivered a 16-minute keynote speech at the 2004 Democratic National Convention that set his political career in motion. And this week in Philadelphia, a new generation of Democrats is jockeying for attention. Few will have their careers launched with the rocket-fuel intensity that Mr. Obama's speech provided, but that will not stop them from trying.\par \par \uc2 On the main stage at the Wells Fargo Center and along the sidelines of the convention, more than a dozen Democratic senators, mayors, governors, cabinet members and state lawmakers are carefully peeking past this year's presidential \uc2 election\uc2  to 2020 or 2024 as they work ballrooms full of delegates, donors and activists who would be critical to the pursuit of a national campaign.\par \par \uc2 By tradition, and in deference to the current generation, personal ambitions are largely unspoken here as the Democratic faithful gather to anoint \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  and to prepare for battle against \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2 . Asked about their national prospects in the next decade, most quickly demurred.\par \par \uc2 ''I can barely think about what I'm having for lunch today,'' joked Kamala Harris, the California attorney general, who is spending the week darting from one grip-and-grin to another. She is running for the Senate this year and is widely seen as a talented national prospect.\par \par \uc2 Like Ms. Harris, those eager to break out of the pack someday are all here.\par \par \uc2 Senator \uc2 Cory Booker\uc2  of New Jersey gave a booming, passionate speech that was well received in the arena but was criticized by television viewers who thought he was shouting. Mayor Kasim Reed of Atlanta was scheduled to take the main stage on Wednesday. The Castro brothers, Representative Joaquin Castro of Texas and Juli\u225\'00\'E1n Castro, the secretary of housing and urban development, have both been mentioned as possible chairmen of the \uc2 Democratic National Committee\uc2 , though it is not clear whether either wants the job.\par \par \uc2 John W. Hickenlooper, the governor of Colorado, arrived in Philadelphia with a packed schedule that included a reception with Washington lobbyists, luncheons for the \uc2 Democratic Governors Association\uc2  and interviews with national news networks. \uc2 Gov. Terry McAuliffe\uc2  of Virginia is here, as are Senators Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota and Kirsten Gillibrand of New York, each shaking hands and testing messages.\par \par \uc2 ''Our policies are stuck in the 'Mad Men' era,'' Ms. Gillibrand said during her time on the podium on Monday, part of the prime-time lineup but before the headliners.\par \par \uc2 ''At every convention, there's always one bright shining, new star; we just don't know who it is here yet,'' said Stephanie Cutter, a veteran Democratic strategist who was deputy campaign manager for Mr. Obama's re-\uc2 election\uc2  in 2012. ''The connections that you make, the fund-raising potential and even the media exposure are huge investments for anyone's political career.''\par \par \uc2 By winning the nomination, Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  has broken at least one glass ceiling, giving hope to those who are eager for more women to achieve political success. If she wins, the ultimate ceiling would finally be shattered.\par \par \uc2 But compared with Republicans, Democrats have seen fewer of their young members rise to top positions in Washington, which can be a springboard to the White House. Beyond Mr. Obama, the leadership of the Democratic Party is an aging one: \uc2 Nancy Pelosi\uc2 , the House minority leader, and Harry Reid, the minority leader in the Senate, are both 76. Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  is 68. Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts is 67, and Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont is 74.\par \par \uc2 By contrast, the average age of the Republican House leadership is under 50 -- Speaker Paul D. Ryan is 46 -- and many of the party's committee chairmen are relatively young.\par \par \uc2 If Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  wins the White House in November, the party may need to spend the next eight years discovering which young Democratic politicians can appeal to millennials and win elections. If she loses, the Democratic Party will be under pressure to find a new standard-bearer in just four years.\par \par \uc2 That could be Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia, whose selection as Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's running mate immediately made him one of the Democrats best positioned to follow Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  on the national stage.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Kaine, who is 58, surprised many in his party with a forceful and effective speech when Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  introduced him last week in Florida. His address Wednesday night at the convention provides him the opportunity to do the same in front of a much bigger audience. But his political future will also depend on the verdict that voters deliver this fall.\par \par \uc2 Other Democrats are not waiting for eight years to start developing a national identity and a network of friends, activists and donors.\par \par \uc2 On Tuesday, Ms. Harris began her day with an early-morning appearance on MSNBC's ''Morning Joe,'' where she gushed about Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  and tried to express understanding for the still-frustrated supporters of Mr. Sanders.\par \par \uc2 Next up was a stop at a panel discussion titled ''Bigger Than the Boomers: Why Millennials Are the Most Important Demographic of 2016,'' hosted on the second floor of the Ritz Carlton by Media Matters Action Network, Voto Latino and other liberal groups.\par \par \uc2 ''My sister, Maya, and I joke that we grew up surrounded by a bunch of adults who spent full time marching and shouting about this thing called justice,'' Ms. Harris said, offering the kind of biographical introduction that is still necessary for her. ''And frankly, that's why I wanted to be a lawyer.''\par \par \uc2 It was a short walk to the Marriott in Center City Philadelphia, where Ms. Harris arrived in the huge ballroom on the fifth floor just a few minutes after Mr. Sanders made an appearance. The crowd, some of whom had shouted and booed when Mr. Sanders urged them to support Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , was still noisy when she took the microphone.\par \par \uc2 ''Had people not marched and shouted, most of us wouldn't be here this morning,'' she said, repeating her story about her parents having been protesters.\par \par \uc2 She spoke only briefly, but the crowd quieted while she talked about the issues she wants to confront in the Senate: climate change and ''Big Oil,'' immigration, banking overhaul, college loans and a new ''smart crime'' approach to the country's criminal justice problems.\par \par \uc2 ''She's strong, she's articulate, she just makes a lot of sense,'' said Rich Gipson, a retired teacher from Merced, Calif., who called himself a fan of Ms. Harris's. ''She's on top of the list. Coming from California, she is naturally going to become a leader of the country.''\par \par \uc2 Ms. Harris's message to the Californians in the audience was that the state should assume a leadership role beyond its borders. The state's huge population and complex issues should give it an outsize role in shaping the way the country deals with its problems, she said.\par \par \uc2 She was talking about the state, but she might just as well have been talking about her political fortunes. She concluded with a plea that seemed to have an echo of her ambitions.\par \par \uc2 ''Let us lead, like we have been doing in California,'' she urged. ''Let's be a leader for our country.''\par \par \uc2 Find out what you need to know about the 2016 presidential race today, and get politics news updates via \uc2 Facebook\uc2 , \uc2 Twitter\uc2  and the First Draft newsletter.\par \par \uc2 Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey during the roll call vote at the Democratic National Convention on Tuesday, top.

\par\par \b \uc2 Rocky 1993 Taught Nominee Caution\b0\par\par\uc2 By Laura Meckler   \par \uc2 1,779 \uc2 words\par \uc2 28 July 2016\par \uc2 The Wall Street Journal\par \uc2 J\par A1\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 WASHINGTON -- \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  arrived at the White House in 1993 determined to chart a new course as first lady. She would lead her husband's ambitious effort to enact a health-care plan and make good on his promise of a 2-for-1 presidency.\par \par \uc2 What followed was one of the most trying years of her life. She faced scandal investigations, harsh media coverage, personal tragedy and, by year's end, a health-care plan spiraling toward defeat.\par \par \uc2 Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's introduction to Washington politics began her transformation from an outspoken former first lady of Arkansas to the cautious and sometimes mistrustful Democratic presidential nominee who will take the stage in Philadelphia on Thursday.\par \par \uc2 That year helps explain the \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  who campaigns today: a scripted politician focused on incremental policy advances that may have a better chance of success but fall short of what many in her party want.\par \par \uc2 Patti Solis Doyle, a longtime aide who was a manager of Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's first presidential campaign, says the "unrelenting" criticism of that year left her risk-averse. "You can see her think about the words coming out of her mouth, knowing she knows, 'I have to be careful about what I say,' " she says.\par \par \uc2 At times back then, the controversies were created by others. In some cases, she made things worse for herself by her own miscalculations.\par \par \uc2 Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  "was hurt and surprised by the extent of the criticism and suspicion she ran into when she came to Washington," according to Robert Reich, a longtime friend who served as President \uc2 Bill \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's first labor secretary. "If you suddenly found yourself moving through a field of land mines, you would be much more cautious and you'd start armoring yourself."\par \par \uc2 Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  set a different tone for a political wife during her husband's 1992 campaign. When asked about her decision to practice law while her husband was governor of Arkansas, she responded: "I suppose I could have stayed home and baked cookies and had teas, but what I decided to do was to fulfill my profession." Such comments offended some voters and touched a nerve as the nation debated the changing role of women.\par \par \uc2 Criticism she received took a toll. Years later, allies saw her desire for privacy in her decision, as secretary of state, to use a private email server for official business. She says she did so for convenience. Republicans have accused her of violating government policy and jeopardizing national security, and the Obama administration's Federal Bureau of Investigation director called her conduct "extremely careless."\par \par \uc2 Her handling of various probes into her email practices has become a drag with voters. In a June Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll, 69% of people said they were concerned that Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  has a "record of being dishonest and not trustworthy." She has admitted she made a mistake and that it has hurt her credibility.\par \par \uc2 "A lot of people tell pollsters they don't trust me," she said last month at a speech in Chicago, in a rare moment of introspection. "I've thought a lot about what's behind it. You hear 25 years' worth of wild accusations, anyone would start to wonder. And it certainly is true, I've made mistakes; I don't know anyone who hasn't."\par \par \uc2 Newt Gingrich\uc2 , who was in the House Republican leadership in 1993, says he recalls Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  coming to see him and other House GOP leaders to discuss health care. "My advice was don't try to write a comprehensive bill because it will collapse," he says. "She thanked us and went back to do whatever she was going to do."\par \par \uc2 Mr. Gingrich says when Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  got to the Senate, her approach had changed. "She certainly was a more bipartisan and more open person as a senator, more than when she was first lady, and that may be a function of what she learned," he says.\par \par \uc2 Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  declined to comment for this article.\par \par \uc2 When she arrived at the White House with her husband in January 1993, a Gallup poll found 46% of Americans thought she should play an active role in policy-making, and 49% thought she shouldn't.\par \par \uc2 She set up offices in the West Wing of the White House, where the president's top advisers work, and in the East Wing, where first ladies had long overseen pet projects.\par \par \uc2 Her husband put her in charge of the effort to overhaul the health-care system, a process vexed from the start. Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  kept the deliberations of the task force she led behind closed doors, cloaking the process in secrecy and feeding suspicions they had something to hide.\par \par \uc2 The president's economic advisers and key lawmakers blocked her effort to add a health-care proposal to a budget bill that was on a fast-track through Congress. Then it was pushed behind other priorities. With each passing month, the president's political capital diminished.\par \par \uc2 That March, her father had a stroke, and she rushed to Little Rock, Ark., to be with him. She spent the next 16 days at her dying father's bedside, she recalled in her memoir.\par \par \uc2 There was one speech she felt she couldn't cancel, at the University of Texas. She jotted notes on the flight to Austin and wound up delivering a rumination on what she called "the politics of meaning." It was a call for Americans to take personal responsibility to create the society they wished to live in, and to strengthen the institutions of family and community so the nation might emerge from its "spiritual vacuum."\par \par \uc2 "It is not going to be easy to redefine who we are as human beings in this postmodern age," she said.\par \par \uc2 The next day, her father died. One of her best friends, Diane Blair, was in Austin and described the speech, in a note to herself, as "an extraordinary event," according to her papers, housed at the \uc2 University of Arkansas\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Elsewhere, Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  was mocked. One columnist called the whole thing "psychobabble." The \uc2 New York Times Magazine\uc2  characterized her musings as "easy, moralistic preaching" and put Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  on its cover for an article it titled "Saint Hillary."\par \par \uc2 After that, the first lady shied away from such public introspection, says Melanne Verveer, her deputy chief of staff at the time."When you get burned, you don't really want to go into the fire again."\par \par \uc2 Early in the administration, the \uc2 Clinton\uc2  team learned of accounting irregularities at the White House Travel Office, which makes arrangements for the White House press corps. In May 1993, all seven workers were fired.\par \par \uc2 When they were replaced by a team led by a distant \uc2 Bill \uc2 Clinton\uc2  cousin, the move smelled of nepotism. Some accounts had Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  demanding the firings. Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  said she made an offhand comment that was interpreted as a directive. The controversy spiraled into a yearslong investigation.\par \par \uc2 It also contributed to pressure on her former law partner and close friend Vincent Foster, then deputy White House counsel. One afternoon that July, Mr. Foster drove to a park in northern Virginia, put a pistol in his mouth and pulled the trigger.\par \par \uc2 His suicide was a devastating personal blow to Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , and the aftermath made it worse. White House officials including Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's chief of staff removed what they said were the Clintons' personal legal papers from Mr. Foster's office before investigators could examine them.\par \par \uc2 That spawned another extended inquiry and gave fodder to conspiracy theorists who charged Mr. Foster was killed to cover up wrongdoing. Investigations found no evidence of that.\par \par \uc2 That fall, the White House finally turned its attention back to health care. In October, Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  gave well-received testimony to five congressional committees over two days. The White House delivered a 1,342-page bill to Congress.\par \par \uc2 The health-care measure never advanced to a vote. It was a major loss for the administration, and Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  took the brunt of the blame.\par \par \uc2 Rep. Peter King\uc2 , a New York Republican, says Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  "became the symbol the Republicans campaigned against. They used her as the reason to defeat the bill." Mr. King says Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  "changed her style after the health-care bill. . .She became much less of a lightning rod in the last six years of the administration."\par \par \uc2 Chris Jennings, who worked with her on the health-care initiative, says she channeled the defeat into resolve to help pass more incremental legislation, such as the Children's Health Insurance Program, which provided coverage to millions.\par \par \uc2 As her husband's first year in office drew to a close, the \uc2 Washington Post\uc2  was reporting that federal regulators wanted a criminal investigation of Madison Guarantee, a failed Arkansas savings-and-loan association. The Clintons had formed a partnership with the owners of the S&L, Jim and Susan McDougal, in a real-estate venture known as Whitewater, aiming to build vacation homes in the Ozark Mountains.\par \par \uc2 They lost money on the deal, but questions were raised about whether the McDougals received favors because of their friendship, and whether they had used Madison to funnel money to Mr. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's re-\uc2 election\uc2  as governor.\par \par \uc2 The Post had a list of questions. Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  persuaded White House political advisers to stonewall, she later said in her memoir.\par \par \uc2 Pressure built on the White House to appoint a special prosecutor. White House political advisers including George Stephanopoulos argued it would be forced upon them if they didn't agree, and it would look like they were trying to cover something up, according to the written accounts of both Mr. Stephanopoulos and Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 . Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , furious and crying, was adamantly opposed, according to Mr. Stephanopoulos's memoir.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  sided with his political advisers. On Jan. 20, 1994, exactly one year into the new administration, Attorney General Janet Reno appointed a special prosecutor, setting off a series of investigations that didn't result in any charges against either \uc2 Clinton\uc2 . The probes ultimately uncovered Mr. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's sexual relationship with a White House intern that led to his 1998 impeachment for lying under oath to investigators.\par \par \uc2 This week's Democratic National Convention has been organized to highlight one of her campaign's central themes, which echo the battles of that year: that she is a fighter. It is a point she hits regularly on the campaign trail and is expected to make in her address Thursday night.\par \par \uc2 "I've been called a lot of things," she said in Chicago, "but quitter is not one of them."\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=wjco20160728000123"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document J000000020160728ec7s00037\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw272\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4080\pichgoal600

\par\par \b \uc2 The Democratic Convention: \uc2 Clinton\uc2  Aide Needles \uc2 Trump\uc2  on Strategy\b0\par\par\uc2 By Colleen McCain Nelson   \par \uc2 309 \uc2 words\par \uc2 28 July 2016\par \uc2 The Wall Street Journal\par \uc2 J\par A4\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 PHILADELPHIA -- \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's campaign manager on Wednesday challenged \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2 's statement that he could be competitive in Democratic strongholds, urging the Republican nominee to stump in traditionally blue states.\par \par \uc2 Robby Mook joked that he stands ready to help Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  forge a game plan for competing in northeastern states where Republicans have long struggled. "I absolutely encourage \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  to spend time campaigning in Connecticut, New York and New Jersey," Mr. Mook said at a lunch hosted by The Wall Street Journal.\par \par \uc2 In response, Jason Miller, a \uc2 Trump\uc2  campaign spokesman, said: "Sun Tzu once said that overconfidence creates situations where you will be defeated by the unexpected. The \uc2 Clinton\uc2  campaign would be wise to take this to heart when facing a national grass-roots movement looking to break up the rigged system in Washington and elect a true outsider like \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2 ."\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  repeatedly has asserted that he will expand the traditional battleground and carve a path to the White House by winning states where Republican presidential candidates rarely compete. The New York businessman has said his home state could be in play in the November \uc2 election\uc2 . And he has called New Jersey a second home, saying that he expects to do well there.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Mook appeared to give such statements little credence, quipping that the \uc2 Clinton\uc2  team would help the GOP nominee develop an itinerary for campaigning in those states.\par \par \uc2 For his part, the \uc2 Clinton\uc2  campaign manager identified North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Florida as key battlegrounds in this \uc2 election\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Some political pundits have suggested that Georgia, which has backed Republican presidential candidates in the last five presidential elections, could be more competitive in this \uc2 election\uc2 . But Mr. Mook shied away from any bold predictions.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=wjco20160728000125"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document J000000020160728ec7s00038\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw272\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4080\pichgoal600

\par\par \b \uc2 Trump\uc2  Urges Russia To Wade Into Race\b0\par\par\uc2 By Beth Reinhard and Damian Paletta   \par \uc2 979 \uc2 words\par \uc2 28 July 2016\par \uc2 The Wall Street Journal\par \uc2 J\par A1\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 Republican presidential nominee \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  invited Russia on Wednesday to unearth some of \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's missing emails from her time as secretary of state, drawing sharp criticism that he was urging a foreign power to spy on the U.S.\par \par \uc2 The comments, which Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  echoed on \uc2 Twitter\uc2  but that his campaign later sought to play down, came in the midst of a week in which Democrats accused Russia of attempting to meddle in the U.S. presidential \uc2 election\uc2  by hacking the \uc2 Democratic National Committee\uc2 's computers and handing over embarrassing emails to the \uc2 WikiLeaks\uc2  website. The accusations also cast a new spotlight on Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's expressions of respect for Russian President \uc2 Vladimir Putin\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 "Russia -- if you're listening, I hope you're able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing," Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  told reporters at his resort near Miami. "I think you will probably be rewarded mightily by our press."\par \par \uc2 Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , the Democratic nominee, turned over about 30,000 emails to the State Department as part of a probe into her use of a private email server. Her attorneys said they erased another 30,000 they deemed personal.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's remarks came as part of an effort by the GOP candidate to draw media coverage during the week of the Democratic convention.\par \par \uc2 National-security experts reacted sharply. "If he is talking about the State Department emails on her server, he is inviting a foreign intelligence service to steal sensitive American government information," said Michael Hayden, head of the \uc2 Central Intelligence Agency\uc2  under President George W. Bush.\par \par \uc2 Timothy Naftali, co-director of New York University's Center for the United States and the Cold War, said he was "flabbergasted" by Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's comments. "Even in jest, a presidential candidate should not give any foreign power anything but zero tolerance about espionage," he said. "He sent a signal to foreign powers that it's open season on U.S. secrets."\par \par \uc2 Clinton\uc2  campaign manager Robby Mook condemned "the idea that you'd have any American, let alone a presidential nominee from a major party, calling for a foreign power to commit espionage in the U.S."\par \par \uc2 Adding to the sense that Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  had veered badly, his campaign released a statement from his running mate, Indiana Gov.Mike Pence, that took a more confrontational approach toward Russia minutes after the press conference ended.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Pence threatened that "both parties and the United States government" will ensure "serious consequences" if the \uc2 Federal Bureau of Investigation\uc2  finds Russia responsible for hacking the \uc2 Democratic National Committee\uc2  emails, which \uc2 WikiLeaks\uc2  released on the eve of the convention. The emails showed party officials plotting to undermine Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's challenger, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders.\par \par \uc2 GOP House Speaker \uc2 Paul Ryan\uc2  echoed Mr. Pence's stance. "Russia is a global menace led by a devious thug. Putin should stay out of this \uc2 election\uc2 ," said Ryan spokesman Brendan Buck.\par \par \uc2 Former GOP House Speaker \uc2 Newt Gingrich\uc2 , a \uc2 Trump\uc2  ally, said Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  was kidding about Russia looking for Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's emails. "The media seems more upset by \uc2 Trump\uc2 's joke about Russian hacking than by the fact that Hillary's personal server was vulnerable to Russia," he said on \uc2 Twitter\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Later Wednesday, \uc2 Trump\uc2  spokesman Jason Miller sought to quell the mounting backlash to Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's remarks. "To be clear, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  did not call on, or invite, Russia or anyone else to hack \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's e-mails today," he said on \uc2 Twitter\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  was asked in the news conference whether he was urging Russia to hack Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's emails. "That's up to the president," he said, referring to Mr. Putin. He added he had no intention to give orders to the Russian leader. "I'm not going to tell Putin what to do," Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  said. "Why should I tell Putin what to do?"\par \par \uc2 Before Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's remarks, the Russian government said it doesn't interfere in elections of other countries. "President Putin has repeatedly said that Russia never interfered and never interferes in the domestic affairs, especially not the electoral processes, of other countries," Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said, according to Russian news agencies. U.S. politicians were creating "Russian boogeyman stories," he added.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  has drawn rebukes from Republicans and Democrats for trading compliments with Mr. Putin during the GOP primaries.\par \par \uc2 On Wednesday night, \uc2 Leon Panetta\uc2 , former defense secretary and director of the Central Intelligence Agency under President \uc2 Barack Obama\uc2 , declared at the Democratic convention: "\uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  today once again took Russia's side . . . In an unstable world, we cannot afford unstable leadership."\par \par \uc2 Trump\uc2  spokesman Stephen Miller took issue with Mr. Panetta for keeping silent about Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's email server and other issues: "He better than most should know how many lives she put at risk."\par \par \uc2 Earlier on Wednesday, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  sought to distance himself from the Russian president.\par \par \uc2 "I never met Putin. I don't know who Putin is," Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  said. "I would treat \uc2 Vladimir Putin\uc2  firmly, but there's nothing I can think of that I'd rather do than have Russia friendly, as opposed to the way they are right now, so that we can go and knock out ISIS."\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's claim contradicted what he said about his relationship with Mr. Putin at a debate in November. "I got to know him very well because we were both on '60 Minutes,' we were stablemates, and we did very well that night," he said.\par \par \uc2 According to a political watchdog group called FactCheck.org, the two men did appear on the same "60 Minutes" episode, which aired on Sept. 27. But Mr. Putin was interviewed in Moscow, while \uc2 Trump\uc2  was interviewed at his New York City penthouse.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=wjco20160728000122"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document J000000020160728ec7s00036\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw272\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4080\pichgoal600

\par\par \b \uc2 Election\uc2  2016: GOP Sets Sights On Scranton, Pa.\b0\par\par\uc2 By Reid J. Epstein   \par \uc2 559 \uc2 words\par \uc2 28 July 2016\par \uc2 The Wall Street Journal\par \uc2 J\par A8\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 SCRANTON, Pa. -- Few parts of the country are more illustrative of \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2 's attempt to redraw the Electoral College map than Pennsylvania, and no part of the state is more important to the Republican's chances than Scranton.\par \par \uc2 Long a Democratic bastion, this blue-collar town of 76,000 offers a near-perfect fit for Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's demographic: It is almost entirely white, economically depressed and angry about illegal immigration.\par \par \uc2 President George H.W. Bush was the last Republican to carry Pennsylvania in a presidential \uc2 election\uc2 . And this part of the state has been heavily Democratic for generations. Vice President \uc2 Joe Biden\uc2  was born here. \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's father, Hugh Rodham, is buried in the Washburn Street Cemetery in town.\par \par \uc2 Only once since 2000 has a Republican presidential candidate won more than 37% of the general-\uc2 election\uc2  vote in Lackawanna County, which includes Scranton. "It's very, very, very tough for us," said Rob Gleason, the state GOP chairman. "It's got a long history of Irish Catholics who live there, and they are conservative Democrats. They are very slow to change."\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's success here depends on converting registered Democrats like Paula Marcho to his cause. Ms. Marcho, 54 years old, voted for President \uc2 Barack Obama\uc2  and receives treatment for her cervical cancer through the Affordable Care Act that the president signed.\par \par \uc2 Now, the unemployed waitress said she finds \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  untrustworthy and is attracted to Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's position on illegal immigration. "I like the way he speaks," Ms. Marcho said. "I know he has a foul mouth, but the other ones, I think they're phony."\par \par \uc2 At his rally here on Wednesday, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  brought along his son, Eric, to talk up the family's northeast Pennsylvania bona fides. "I went to boarding school in Pennsylvania," said the younger Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , who attended the Hill School in Pottstown, 100 miles south of here.\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 Trump\uc2  campaign has made Pennsylvania a linchpin of its Electoral College strategy. Wednesday's appearance was Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's third in the state since he won California and other late primaries on June 7.\par \par \uc2 Demographics suggest this part of northeast Pennsylvania is a prime area for Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  to do better than past GOP nominees. Lackawanna County is 92% white, with a shrinking population that is older than the national average -- a combination that plays to the GOP nominee's strength.\par \par \uc2 "\uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  is resonating with the people here, and that's not only Republicans. It's Democrats, it's union people, it's independents," said Rep. Lou Barletta, a Republican, who, as mayor of nearby Hazleton in 2006, enacted one of the nation's first laws restricting where illegal immigrants could live and work -- a law later overturned by a federal judge.\par \par \uc2 There are some early signs Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  will outperform recent GOP results. Although there are still more than twice as many registered Democrats as Republicans in Lackawanna County, 3,011 local Democrats have switched their party registration to Republicans this year, compared with 502 Republicans who became Democrats, according to the latest data from the Pennsylvania Department of State.\par \par \uc2 Statewide, 80,674 Democrats have become Republicans in 2016, compared with 28,522 Republicans who became Democrats.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=wjco20160728000121"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document J000000020160728ec7s00035\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw272\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4080\pichgoal600

\par\par \b \uc2 The Democratic Convention: Chelsea Set to Make Case\b0\par\par\uc2 By Rebecca Ballhaus and James V. Grimaldi   \par \uc2 687 \uc2 words\par \uc2 28 July 2016\par \uc2 The Wall Street Journal\par \uc2 J\par A7\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 PHILADELPHIA -- A day before \uc2 Chelsea \uc2 Clinton\uc2  was to address the Democratic convention, she stepped away from the convention hall on Wednesday to rail against what she called \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2 's "divisive" and "degrading" rhetoric.\par \par \uc2 Ms. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  faces the unprecedented task of preparing for the prospect of becoming the first daughter for a second time. In recent years, she has become increasingly involved in the family businesses -- politics and the \uc2 Clinton\uc2  Foundation\uc2 . In 2008, she hit the campaign trail for her mother's failed bid to win the Democratic nomination. She has been back on the stump for her mother since last year.\par \par \uc2 Ms. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  on Thursday will introduce her mother at the convention, before the nominee's acceptance speech. Her friend \uc2 Ivanka \uc2 Trump\uc2  did the same for \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  at last week's GOP convention, promoting her father's candidacy, committing him to some progressive stances on women's issues and never mentioning the Democratic nominee by name.\par \par \uc2 But unlike Ms. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , who is active in managing her father's properties, Ms. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's future beyond this campaign is less clear. In 2011, she joined the foundation created by her father, Bill, when he left the White House, but the foundation's prospects under a \uc2 Clinton\uc2  White House are unclear.\par \par \uc2 In June, Mr. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  acknowledged the political reality that should his wife be elected, the foundation would have to make changes about fundraising and mission. About the same time, a senior \uc2 Clinton\uc2  campaign adviser told The Wall Street Journal that Mr. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  wouldn't be able to continue to raise money for the foundation.\par \par \uc2 People close to the Clintons said they could see Ms. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , should her mother be elected, taking on some of the roles traditionally reserved for the first lady, such as organizing holiday parties and selecting menus for state dinners.\par \par \uc2 Ms. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  has been outspoken on the campaign trail in recent months. Speaking at an event Wednesday hosted by the \uc2 Human Rights Campaign\uc2 , a gay-rights advocacy group, Ms. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  criticized the Republican Party platform, finalized at last week's convention, which she called the "most regressive, least inclusive platform in modern political history."\par \par \uc2 "I thought a lot about what I found most offensive last week," she said. "It's hard to pick just one part."\par \par \uc2 Calling the \uc2 election\uc2  the "most important" of her lifetime as the first in which she will cast her vote as a mother, Ms. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , 36 years old, said Wednesday that her mother provides a "stark contrast" to the gay-rights stances of Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  and his running mate, Indiana Gov. Mike Pence.\par \par \uc2 The Republican platform opposes same-sex marriage and supports parents' right to consent to medical treatment on behalf of their children. Gay-rights advocates read that as a tacit endorsement of conversion therapy, a practice intended to stop gay people from being gay. Ms. Clintonon Wednesdaylikened conversion therapy to "child abuse" and said her mother would federally ban the practice.\par \par \uc2 Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus, asked by the Associated Press whether the GOP supported that practice, replied, "It's not in the platform."\par \par \uc2 Ms. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , who has degrees from Stanford, Oxford and Columbia, has benefited from her family connections. She worked for a time at Avenue Capital, an investment firm run by \uc2 Marc Lasry\uc2 , a close \uc2 Clinton\uc2  friend. She is a paid director of IAC/InterActiveCorp., the media company run by \uc2 Barry Diller\uc2 , a longtime friend of the Clintons.\par \par \uc2 Ms. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's husband, Marc Mezvinsky, operates a hedge fund, and several of the top investors have been longtime friends and supporters of the Clintons and their foundation.\par \par \uc2 She has also seen other personal relationships complicated by politics -- including her friendship with Ms. \uc2 Trump\uc2 . At an event here on Tuesday, Ms. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  was asked about Ms. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's speech assertion that her father would back "equal pay" for women. Ms. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  said she is dubious about Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's commitment to the issue "given it's not something that he has spoken about."\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=wjco20160728000119"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document J000000020160728ec7s00033\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw272\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4080\pichgoal600

\par\par \b \uc2 The Democratic Convention: Centrists Keeping Their Heads Down\b0\par\par\uc2 By Siobhan Hughes   \par \uc2 615 \uc2 words\par \uc2 28 July 2016\par \uc2 The Wall Street Journal\par \uc2 J\par A7\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 PHILADELPHIA -- One block from a protest site where T-shirt clad supporters of Bernie Sanders called to continue their revolution, Virginia Sen. Mark Warner was speaking at an event where he identified himself as a member of one of the most endangered groups in the Democratic Party: centrist.\par \par \uc2 "As somebody who absolutely believes in the free enterprise system, it's got to be working for more people or you're going to see this anger continue to explode," the blazer-clad Mr. Warner saidTuesdayas he left a small event organized by the centrist group Third Way, where he talked about how to make a capitalist system work in an era of so-called gig jobs that lack pensions, health care and jobless benefits.\par \par \uc2 Such moderates, with their faith in capitalism and compromise, are keeping a low profile at this week's Democratic convention.\par \par \uc2 In an \uc2 election\uc2  year in which race, gender, sexual identity, and economic status are playing outsize roles, Democrats aren't batting an eye at the gender-neutral bathroom at the Wells Fargo Center or even the "gluten-free zone" sign that advertises the pretzels that are free of an out-of-favor protein.\par \par \uc2 Instead, centrists are the ones who draw raised eyebrows -- encouraging many to keep their presence small.\par \par \uc2 On Wednesday, Rep. Ami Bera (D., Calif.), who has a target on his back because he is one of 28 House Democrats who last year helped Republicans pass a measure to facilitate the approval of trade deals, attended a Third Way luncheon that was closed to the public.\par \par \uc2 The last time a Democrat named \uc2 Clinton\uc2  was running for president, centrists were ascendant. The Democratic Leadership Council, a moderate group with close ties to \uc2 Bill \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , was on the upswing in the 1990s amid an internet boom that led to what at the time was the longest economic expansion in U.S. history. The Democratic Party's 1996 platform encouraged "personal responsibility" and called for balancing the budget.\par \par \uc2 This year, the party's platform is focused not on personal responsibility, but on the government's responsibility to the people. It is skeptical of the power of markets to solve the problems of income inequality. There is no mention of a balanced budget, but instead a call for free tuition and community college and free Wi-Fi.\par \par \uc2 "The pendulum swings," said former Rep. Ron Barber (D., Ariz.), who was a member of the Blue Dogs, a dwindling group of conservative Democrats, before he lost his seat in 2014. "People are very frustrated -- I get it -- they're angry."\par \par \uc2 One measure of the challenges facing the remaining moderates is that the criticisms are coming from college-educated people very much like themselves.\par \par \uc2 "I'm of a generation being crushed by student debt," said Jared Hicks, a 25-year-old delegate from Massachusetts who supported Mr. Sanders, who said he would now return to the Senate as an Independent. "Do you know how many college-grad friends I have who are suffering, who are not living the lives that they planned, that they wanted, that they were told they could have?"\par \par \uc2 "The Democratic Party is "no longer for the people. It's for Wall Street and the establishment," said Henry Hernandez, a 46-year-old retired government worker from Yonkers, N.Y., who showed up at a protest this week.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Barber predicted the pendulum would swing back in November. "Anger dissipates," he said. "We're going to see what I believe is generally the direction the public wants to go, and that is move to the center."\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=wjco20160728000118"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document J000000020160728ec7s00032\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw272\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4080\pichgoal600

\par\par \b \uc2 A Voice of Her Own\b0\par\par\uc2 By Dorothy Rabinowitz   \par \uc2 1,048 \uc2 words\par \uc2 28 July 2016\par \uc2 The Wall Street Journal\par \uc2 J\par A15\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 A lot can still happen at the Democratic convention, but nothing is likely to matter as much as \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's look and tone, what she says -- or perhaps more important -- what she doesn't say as she takes the stage Thursday night. \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2 , a man of iron predictability, faced no such test last week and delivered no surprises.\par \par \uc2 Not that there weren't some striking moments in the glum enterprise that concluded in Cleveland, among them Melania \uc2 Trump\uc2 's quickly famous speech. Also the contribution of \uc2 Chris Christie\uc2 , who functions periodically as the governor of New Jersey. Mr. Christie used his speaker's spot to conduct a lengthy mock trial of Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  distinguished mainly for its unremitting tone of hysteria. It was a spectacle many Americans may remember should Mr. Christie become, as he apparently hopes, attorney general under Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 The Republican presidential candidate has one obvious advantage over Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 : He has never been in a position to absorb, as she has, the language, reflexes, certitudes, and high principles ready to be deployed on all occasions that are peculiar to the world of the Obama administration.\par \par \uc2 Not that Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  isn't capable of embracing certain of the president's views on America, first revealed in 2009 during Mr. Obama's now-famous trip abroad to see heads of state and express regret for America's offenses, known to history as the Obama apology tour. Those views of America as a nation in decline, virtually without allies, emerged ever more conspicuously during the president's first term.\par \par \uc2 Last week Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  lashed out at \uc2 NATO\uc2 , then went on to argue that the U.S. shouldn't be interfering in the business of other nations. And that we had so many failures of our own at home: Ferguson, the killing of police -- so much. Who are we to tell the butchers and mass murderers of the world what to do?\par \par \uc2 Unlike Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  doesn't know Obama-speak and doesn't need deprogramming. He hasn't absorbed the language that Americans recognize well after eight years. They have heard through all these years the nostrums, the reflexive high-minded oratory, that have come with every terror attack. They can hear it all over again in Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Never was this clearer than in the days following the terrorist assault in Nice, when she described the attack as cowardly and vowed that we would never allow terrorists to undermine our egalitarian and democratic values. Such assertions always feel, and are, strangely off the point, which is the horror of the atrocity that has taken place.\par \par \uc2 The notion that terrorists are busying themselves trying to undermine our egalitarian values is odd, especially in light of the obvious fact that what they are trying first and foremost to do is kill us.\par \par \uc2 Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , like Mr. Obama, seems to have divined the wishes of our enemies. Not only do they want to undermine our democratic values, they would, as she recently said of Islamic State, "love for us to be dragged into a ground war" -- a perception highly appealing to a political administration now scarcely able to conceive of a circumstance dire enough to warrant American ground troops.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  addressed the cruel slaughter in Nice but had no more hard specifics to offer about what might be done than Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  did. He nevertheless managed a tone far more effective in its outrage -- the voice of a leader in time of war. It helped, no doubt, that he felt no need to deliver warnings about the undermining of our democratic values.\par \par \uc2 In July alone, eight police officers were killed in high-profile shootings -- five in Dallas during a Black Lives Matter protest and three more 10 days later in Baton Rouge. The day after the latter killings, as stunned citizens grieved -- black Americans included, especially those who had seen in Dallas how the police officers had rushed to protect them from sniper fire without regard to their own safety -- \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  addressed a convention of the \uc2 NAACP\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 She began with a stern, clearly heartfelt, denunciation of the killing of police, then proceeded to her main focus -- namely, a recital of the innumerable injustices visited on black Americans by the police. It did not apparently occur to her that it might be possible to mention to the \uc2 NAACP\uc2  the injustice, the fatal consequences, of the war that had been whipped up against police by activists portraying them as oppressors and murderers.\par \par \uc2 The planners of the Democratic convention included on their list of honored speakers a group of mothers -- known as Mothers of The Movement -- most of whose children died at the hands of the police. There was no opportunity, however, for a speech by any of the wives or parents of the slain police officers. The enraged officers of Philadelphia's police union promised not to forget this slap in the face by the Democrats. Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  and company had evidently failed to grasp that following the dictates of political expediency, otherwise known as pandering, would in the end be more costly than doing what was right and just.\par \par \uc2 To win the \uc2 election\uc2  Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  will have to sway voters from across the political spectrum. True, huge portions of the electorate are appalled by the prospect of her opponent winning the presidency, which is to her advantage. But huge numbers of Americans are no less appalled by the possibility of a \uc2 Clinton\uc2  presidency that would in effect be another Obama term. All of which is the reason Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  will have to do her utmost to find a voice of her own.\par \par \uc2 She may well find one and perhaps even something of a political backbone. Enough, at least, to ensure that she resists pressures to move even further left than she already has to win supporters from Bernie Sanders's sullen troops now brooding over their lost revolution. It will be an effort and not easy but it should hardly be too much for the candidate who may become the first woman elected president of the United States.\par \par \uc2 ---\par \par \uc2 Ms. Rabinowitz is a member of the Journal's editorial board.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=wjco20160728000103"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document J000000020160728ec7s0002n\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw272\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4080\pichgoal600

\par\par \b \uc2 The Democratic Convention: Wall Street Pulls Back From Conventions --- Harshly criticized in the primaries, banking firms take hands-off approach to events\b0\par\par\uc2 By Donna Borak   \par \uc2 657 \uc2 words\par \uc2 28 July 2016\par \uc2 The Wall Street Journal\par \uc2 J\par A6\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 WASHINGTON -- Wall Street descended on this week's Democratic National Convention, held in Philadelphia's Wells Fargo Center -- quietly.\par \par \uc2 In an \uc2 election\uc2  year when the financial-services sector is seen as a political liability, top bank executives and trade-group chiefs have largely stayed away from both parties' conventions, while those who do attend are keeping a low profile.\par \par \uc2 The banking industry was particularly vilified in the Democratic primary fight: \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  came under fire from Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, her rival for the nomination, for receiving speaking fees from big banks and for her husband's role in undoing Glass-Steagall, a Depression-era law separating commercial and investment banking.\par \par \uc2 The Republican Party, in a surprise development at its convention in Cleveland last week, included reinstating Glass-Steagall in its platform. The move, which echoes changes urged by Mr. Sanders and others on the left, is a departure from House Republicans' agenda. The Democrats added platform language calling for a "modernized version" of the 1933 law.\par \par \uc2 With the national mood sour on Wall Street, banks are taking a more hands-off approach than in previous years, sponsoring events on the sidelines of both national conventions, hoping to avoid any appearance of being too close to either party. Just how much Wall Street participation has dropped from previous years' conventions is hard to quantify, but attendees and analysts said they saw a pullback at both events.\par \par \uc2 "There's a populist wind that's driving this \uc2 election\uc2  and it's impacting both parties, which makes Wall Street in particular an easy target and some of its top executives persona non grata for the far left and the far right," said Isaac Boltansky, an analyst for Compass Point Research & Trading LLC, an investment firm.\par \par \uc2 Camden Fine, head of the \uc2 Independent Community Bankers of America\uc2 , said the trade group decided not to participate in this year's conventions, adding that "partisanship has become so extreme that as a nonpartisan trade association of community banks, we did not want to get typed as being supportive of one side or the other." The ICBA had attended the previous three conventions for both parties.\par \par \uc2 The American Bankers Association and the Financial Services Roundtable, trade associations representing U.S. banks, didn't send their chiefs. The two men, the ABA's Rob Nichols and the Roundtable's \uc2 Tim Pawlenty\uc2 , the former Republican governor of Minnesota, had attended past GOP conventions in previous roles.\par \par \uc2 J.P. Morgan\uc2  didn't provide any contributions to either convention this year. The firm had contributed to the GOP's 2012 convention in Tampa, Fla., but didn't provide funding to the Democratic convention that year because corporate contributions weren't accepted. This time around, the bank sent a small contingent of employees to support philanthropic projects in Philadelphia and gave a $150,000 grant to support a summer work program for youth in the city. It also co-hosted an event on hiring veterans in Cleveland during the GOP convention.\par \par \uc2 The conventions, filled with networking events and parties, still drew some executives from the industry.\par \par \uc2 Blackstone Group LP\uc2 , one of the country's largest private-equity firms, is planning a reception Thursday evening, as the Democratic convention wraps up, with its President Tony James, according to \uc2 Christine Anderson\uc2 , a senior managing director who is also in Philadelphia this week.\par \par \uc2 Bank of America\uc2  teamed up with the publication \uc2 Politico\uc2 , helping to host conversations with newsmakers at both conventions joined by \uc2 Anne Finucane\uc2 , the bank's vice chairman, and Jim Mahoney, the head of its global public policy and corporate communications. "We made the decision a long time ago way before the nominees were known that we were going to support the host committee," said Mr. Mahoney.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=wjco20160728000102"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document J000000020160728ec7s0002m\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw272\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4080\pichgoal600

\par\par \b \uc2 Incumbent's Miscue Turns House Race Into Dogfight\b0\par\par\uc2 By Kate King   \par \uc2 867 \uc2 words\par \uc2 28 July 2016\par \uc2 The Wall Street Journal\par \uc2 J\par A17\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 New Jersey Democrats have met only defeat in their recent efforts to capture the state's Fifth Congressional District seat, but their campaign this year has gotten a boost from a controversy surrounding Republican incumbent Scott Garrett.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Garrett, 57 years old, has represented the district in New Jersey's northwestern corner since 2003. His Democratic challenger in the November race, former \uc2 Microsoft\uc2  executive \uc2 Josh Gottheimer\uc2 , is portraying Mr. Garrett as ultraconservative and out of touch.\par \par \uc2 "The truth is he's fighting for the Tea Party," said Mr. Gottheimer, 41. "It's clear that he doesn't belong here."\par \par \uc2 Mr. Garrett, a Wantage resident and married father of two, is a founding member of the House Freedom Caucus, an alliance of hard-line conservatives that last year led the drive to oust former House Speaker \uc2 John Boehner\uc2 . Mr. Garrett is also chairman of a House Financial Services subcommittee, a powerful post that has netted him contributions from Wall Street.\par \par \uc2 But over the past year, Mr. Garrett lost important donors following media reports that he refused to pay dues to the National Republican Congressional Committee because it was recruiting gay candidates.\par \par \uc2 In an interview last week with The Wall Street Journal, Mr. Garrett said his comments were mischaracterized and that his opposition was specific to gay marriage.\par \par \uc2 "I agree with the Republican platform and the Republican platform supports traditional marriage and so I will be supporting those who support traditional marriage," he said.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Gottheimer cited Mr. Garrett's past affiliation with Veritas Christian Academy, a Christian high school in Sussex County that lists homosexual activity and obtaining an abortion as punishable by automatic suspension in its parent-student handbook.\par \par \uc2 "Scott Garrett has a long and sad history of sexism and bigotry that are totally inconsistent with Jersey values," Mr. Gottheimer said.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Garrett had limited involvement with the school as a trustee in 2006 and 2007, according to his spokeswoman.\par \par \uc2 "Scott Garrett is a Christian, as are many voters in the Fifth District, and if \uc2 Josh Gottheimer\uc2  does not think they are entitled to religious freedom, he is most unqualified to protect the Constitution as an elected representative," a spokeswoman for Mr. Garrett said in an email.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Gottheimer, who lives in Wyckoff with his wife and two young children, has never held elective office. He was a speechwriter for former President \uc2 Bill \uc2 Clinton\uc2  and says he is positioning himself as a "fiscally conservative, socially progressive" candidate in the style of Mr. Garrett's Republican predecessor, Marge Roukema.\par \par \uc2 But the district's record in electing a moderate doesn't necessarily mean Mr. Garrett is vulnerable, said former Republican New Jersey Gov. Tom Kean. "This isn't the first time that people have written that this is a race that Democrats should win, and Scott Garrett always seems to come out on top," he said.\par \par \uc2 Nathan Gonzales, editor of the Rothenberg & Gonzales Political Report, a nonpartisan newsletter, said Democrats' main challenges are that Mr. Gottheimer lacks name recognition and that the Fifth Congressional District falls within an expensive media market.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Gottheimer, who is receiving support from the House Democrats' "Red to Blue" fundraising initiative, has raised $2.9 million to Mr. Garrett's $1.4 million this \uc2 election\uc2  cycle, according to federal \uc2 election\uc2  records.\par \par \uc2 The criticism over what Mr. Garrett allegedly said about gay candidates "has helped Democrats bring national attention to the race, it's helped Gottheimer raise money," Mr. Gonzales said.\par \par \uc2 At the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia on Wednesday, New Jersey Senate President Steve Sweeney, a Democrat, boycotted a delegate breakfast sponsored by the New Jersey utility Public Service Electric & Gas because of its contributions to Mr. Garrett, who Mr. Sweeney said has "bigoted, anti-LGBT views." The utility gave Mr. Garrett $2,500 in March 2015, according to federal \uc2 election\uc2  records.\par \par \uc2 A spokeswoman for the utility said it had "deep respect" for Mr. Sweeney but wouldn't discuss its political contributions in the race.\par \par \uc2 A spokeswoman for Mr. Garrett said Mr. Sweeney was threatening a New Jersey business and "spreading lies" about Mr. Garrett.\par \par \uc2 Douglas Steinhardt, who is chairman of the Warren County Republican Committee, said he hadn't heard of any backlash to Mr. Garrett's comments from Republican and unaffiliated voters in his corner of the district. "People are less worried about social issues and more about their financial well-being," he said.\par \par \uc2 But Allen Rapaport, a police commissioner and Republican councilman in the Bergen County borough of Norwood, said he considered Mr. Garrett's social and fiscal views too extreme.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Rapaport said he soured on Mr. Garrett in part because the congressman refused to write a letter on behalf of the Paramus Fire Department, which was applying for a federal grant to pay for a new truck.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Garrett said he is opposed to such federal programs, which he said are funded by siphoning money from taxpayers and sending it to other parts of the country. "We don't get our fair share back," he said. "Every town should be able to hold on to their own money."\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=wjco20160728000084"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document J000000020160728ec7s00024\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw272\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4080\pichgoal600

\par\par \b \uc2 Will \uc2 Clinton\uc2  Decry Her Own Money Machine?\b0\par\par\uc2 By Kimberley A. Strassel   \par \uc2 577 \uc2 words\par \uc2 28 July 2016\par \uc2 The Wall Street Journal\par \uc2 J\par A13\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 This week's Democratic convention has featured a nonstop string of speakers vowing to crack down on "big money" in politics. They will presumably get serious about this project in December, or only after all the "big money" in 2016 has helped put \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  into the White House.\par \par \uc2 To listen to the prime-time speakers here in Philly, there is no greater threat to democracy than the Supreme Court's 2010 decision in \uc2 Citizens United\uc2 , which struck down some limits on political speech. Progressive firebrand Bernie Sanders used his Monday night address to deride it as "one of the worst Supreme Court decisions in the history of our country," which allows "the wealthiest people" to buy elections and move the country toward "oligarchy." Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren echoed that with her own promise that this \uc2 election\uc2  is all about getting "big money out of politics" by overturning \uc2 Citizens United\uc2  so as to "return this government to the people."\par \par \uc2 The theme follows on Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's high-profile vow to propose, within 30 days of taking office, a new constitutional amendment that will "overturn" \uc2 Citizens United\uc2 . That's another way of saying the Democratic nominee intends to gut the First Amendment, putting government in charge of who precisely can speak in elections.\par \par \uc2 It's a dangerous pledge, but also one that is hard to swallow coming from a woman who has spent the past decades building -- via the \uc2 Clinton\uc2  Foundation\uc2  -- one of the most ruthlessly efficient big-money machines ever witnessed in politics. And successfully so, given that the real "big money" to be found this presidential-\uc2 election\uc2  season is all solidly behind Democrats. \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2 's fundraising woes are by now a central factor in the race, as many traditional high-dollar donors remain reluctant to go all in for his candidacy. Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's campaign and its allies, meanwhile, are on track to break records by potentially spending $1.5 billion. Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's side might prove lucky to raise a third of that.\par \par \uc2 Who is filling this Democratic war chest? A Tuesday story in \uc2 Politico\uc2  reported that billionaire \uc2 George Soros\uc2  has given or committed $25 million for Hillary and other Democrats. That includes more than $7 million to Priorities USA Action, a super Pac supporting Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , and $2 million to American Bridge 21st Century, a super Pac devoted to opposing Republicans.\par \par \uc2 Finance reports show that billionaire and green activist \uc2 Tom Steyer\uc2  has donated $31 million to Democratic causes this year. (That's far less than the $74 million Mr. Steyer blew in 2014, but the year is young.) The list of Democrats' superdonors goes on. Entertainment mogul Haim Saban: $11 million. Media baron \uc2 Fred Eychaner\uc2 : $11 million. Hedge-fund manager Don Sussman: $13 million. Add in the multimillion-dollar checks from the Pritzker family (of \uc2 Hyatt\uc2  hotel fame); James Simons (hedge-fund billionaire); and Herbert Sandler (banking baron).\par \par \uc2 The Sanders fans on the left may well believe in their anti-money cause. But Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's world has long been that of the 1%. Though she may feel compelled to chase progressive voters by signing up for their campaign against \uc2 Citizens United\uc2 , don't assume she thinks getting rid of "big money" is good for elections or democracy. What Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  believes is that getting rid of her opponents' money is good for her.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=wjco20160728000082"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document J000000020160728ec7s00022\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw272\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4080\pichgoal600

\par\par \b \uc2 The Democratic Bash Won't Matter\b0\par\par\uc2 By Karl Rove   \par \uc2 800 \uc2 words\par \uc2 28 July 2016\par \uc2 The Wall Street Journal\par \uc2 J\par A13\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 Though the slogan for the first day of the Democratic National Convention was "United Together," the party appeared to be anything but. Hacked emails dumped online by \uc2 WikiLeaks\uc2  had confirmed the worst suspicions of Sen. Bernie Sanders's supporters. The Democratic establishment had been working all along to defeat their man, even discussing whether to plant stories that Mr. Sanders, who is Jewish, doesn't believe in God.\par \par \uc2 After Democratic National Committee Chairwoman \uc2 Debbie Wasserman Schultz\uc2  announced her resignation, she was rewarded by being named an "honorary chair" for \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's campaign. Sanders supporters were hardly satisfied. On Monday the Bernie Bunch booed Ms. Wasserman Schultz off the stage. They demonstrated their frustration in the convention hall, and on Philadelphia's streets, demanding votes on their candidate's proposals on trade and the party's rules.\par \par \uc2 The following day the comedian Sarah Silverman admonished Sandernistas from the podium: "To the Bernie-or-bust people, let me tell you, you are being ridiculous." Standing at her side, Sen. Al Franken (D., Minn.) nodded as Sanders delegates screamed their disapproval. The two Hollywood intellectuals were followed on stage by Paul Simon, who warbled "Bridge Over Troubled Waters." Convention organizers should have tried to get the song's original vocalist, Art Garfunkel.\par \par \uc2 These expressions of disaffection from the Democratic Party's Birkenstock-and-granola wing are entertaining, yet they are not Team \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's principal strategic challenge. Sure, some Bernieites could defect to the Green Party's presidential nominee, Jill Stein, or even to \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2 . Others might skip the polls and spend \uc2 Election\uc2  Day composting. Still, Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's bigger problem is that she personifies the status quo in a year when the dynamic is strongly tilted toward change.\par \par \uc2 Gallup reported last week that only 17% of Americans are satisfied with the country's condition, the same figure as at this point in 2008.\par \par \uc2 A July 13 NBC/Wall Street Journal poll found that a mere 18% of registered voters believe the country is "headed in the right direction," while 73% said things are "off on the wrong track."\par \par \uc2 The same survey found 56% favor someone for president "who will bring major changes to the way government operates even if it is not possible to predict what the changes may be." Only 41% back "someone who will bring a steady approach to the way government operates even if it means fewer changes to how things are now."\par \par \uc2 A June 26 \uc2 Pew Research Center\uc2  survey found that 24% of Americans are "satisfied with the way things are going in this country today"; 71% are "dissatisfied." Fully 77% of voters say Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  would "change the way things work in Washington" (though only 33% think it would be for the better). Just 45% say Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  would bring change (and 20% say it would be for the better).\par \par \uc2 President \uc2 Bill \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's speech Tuesday night didn't significantly alter this dynamic. Even his political talents couldn't transform his wife into a "change-agent," a phrase he repeatedly invoked. If anything, Mr. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  reminded voters that Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  has been a political fixture for decades.\par \par \uc2 Nor did Mr. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  do any favors when he described Hillary's tenure as secretary of state and asked: "How does this square with the things that you heard at the Republican convention?" He said Republicans are running against "a cartoon," thereby dismissing concerns about private email servers, America's retreat from global leadership, the rise of Islamic State, and the disasters in Libya, Syria, Iraq, Egypt, Russia and beyond.\par \par \uc2 Speeches Wednesday by President \uc2 Obama\uc2  and Vice President \uc2 Joe Biden\uc2  were equally unlikely to help Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 . Instead they added to the impression that she represents a third term for their policies, especially as far as they extolled their administration's record. The more they claim the economy is good, the country strong, and the world safe, the more disconnected they appear to swing voters.\par \par \uc2 The White House is telling reporters the president will actively campaign for Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  and Democratic candidates, raising funds starting next week and traveling throughout October. This will only reinforce that the race is a choice between the status quo with Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  and change with Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Team \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's hope lies in convincing voters that Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  will bring only chaos. That's where she should put her emphasis Thursday night and after. The Democratic convention started badly. It's likely to end that way, too -- with the \uc2 election\uc2 's central dynamic, one that works against their nominee, completely intact.\par \par \uc2 ---\par \par \uc2 Mr. Rove helped organize the political-action committee American Crossroads and is the author of "The Triumph of William McKinley" (\uc2 Simon & Schuster\uc2 , 2015).\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=wjco20160728000037"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document J000000020160728ec7s00010\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw272\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4080\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 Philadelphia -- \uc2 Barack Obama\uc2  hasn't been much of a politician as president, but he knew how to pitch \uc2 election\uc2  politics, most famously the 2008 marketing phrase, Hope and Change.\par \par \uc2 "Hope and change" was the ultimate political Rorschach blot, inside which voters could conjure whatever they thought it meant. It turned out to mean almost nothing. Eight years later, two-thirds of the public say the United States is headed in the wrong direction.\par \par \uc2 For all the verbiage the past two convention weeks, we know exactly what glum voters want from Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  and Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 . Since this odyssey began in February, Democrats, Republicans and independents exiting the voting booth in virtually every state put the same thing at the top of their list of what to fix in post-Obama America: the economy.\par \par \uc2 Listening to Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders lament the economic ruins of American life, you'd think the sitting president was George W. Bush and that we were in 2008's Great Recession. In fact, many Americans tell pollsters they think the country is still in a recession. If someone thinks he's in a recession, he is.\par \par \uc2 Unless \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  or \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  deliver stronger economic growth than we've had the past eight years, he or she will be a one-term president. One and done in 2020.\par \par \uc2 It won't stop with them. If they aren't putting stronger growth up within two years, voters will punish their party in the 2018 off-year \uc2 election\uc2 . Democrats will have 25 Senate seats up for judgment. The Hillary edition of the \uc2 Clinton\uc2  presidency would end in two short years.\par \par \uc2 The possibility of a one-term presidency, we may admit, could not be less relevant this week to professional Democrats and Republicans. Just win, baby. What comes after November, however, is not irrelevant to voters who will have to live with the consequences. People didn't watch eight days of droning partisanship for the entertainment value, but for some sign that either party has a path out of the weakest prolonged period of American economic life since the Depression.\par \par \uc2 Attempting to explain away the past eight years, some economists assert that growth statistics are an inadequate measure of the modern economy, even arguing that 2% growth is a "new normal" to which Americans will have to adjust. If so, why does the new normal make so many people so unhappy? Why do people think their children won't have it as good as they did during the old normal?\par \par \uc2 For those who haven't made their peace with lowered expectations, it's worth noting the striking correlation between GDP and the Gallup Poll's historical data on the direction of the country.\par \par \uc2 During the high-growth years of the Reagan presidency, a positive view of the country reached 69%. It hit 71% at the end of \uc2 Bill \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's second term. In the Obama presidency, optimism peaked at 36% in late 2009 when growth reached a below-average 2.5%. After that, the country's mood and economic growth went south for seven straight years.\par \par \uc2 On the evidence available in Philadelphia, the chances of a \uc2 Clinton\uc2  presidency improving on this dispiriting record are about zero.\par \par \uc2 Read through the Democratic platform and one finds no real growth elements. None. It is the Obama agenda with Sanders and Warren footnotes -- "no executive too powerful to jail."\par \par \uc2 As on the \uc2 Clinton\uc2  campaign website, taxes either go up or exist as credit givebacks -- a sop to liberals that won't lift a complex economy.\par \par \uc2 "Regulation" appears only three times, all calls for more. Though the Fed has been running the economy, "monetary policy" appears nowhere.\par \par \uc2 The platform admits 10% youth unemployment and then says, "Democrats will provide direct federal funding for a range of local programs that will put young people to work and create new career opportunities." Robbing Peter to sedate Paul is an economic model from prehistory.\par \par \uc2 Meanwhile, the smoke signals coming from \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  on lower taxes and less regulation suggest at least a fighting chance for growth. And yet . . .\par \par \uc2 A lot of what he's saying mimics the Democrats' weak-growth economics. The danger in claiming solidarity with Bernie Sanders's anti-trade policy is that in practice it would undermine any of Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's offset gains from better tax or regulatory policy.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's acceptance-speech remarks on infrastructure spending could have been lifted directly from Mr. Obama. Like the Democrats, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's notions on manufacturing -- a promise to resurrect the economy of the 1960s -- simply won't happen.\par \par \uc2 Sophisticates argue, sotto voce, that Hillary in office will be the second coming of Bill and that beneath \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2 's trade rants, he's "fundamentally" a pro-growth guy.\par \par \uc2 But the new progressive Democrats raging around Philadelphia won't let Hillary be Bill. And Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  isn't making the case to voters for his economics over hers.\par \par \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2 's campaign appears to be wholly aspirational. Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  could win if amid this level of economic anxiety, voters conclude that her handouts are worth four years of the devil they know.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=wjco20160728000035"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document J000000020160728ec7s0000y\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw272\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4080\pichgoal600

\par\par \b \uc2 Politics & Ideas: The Endangered Democratic Moderate\b0\par\par\uc2 By William A. Galston   \par \uc2 844 \uc2 words\par \uc2 27 July 2016\par \uc2 The Wall Street Journal\par \uc2 J\par A11\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 The Democratic Party whose nomination \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  will accept this week has changed significantly since her husband last ran for president two decades ago -- and so has the country she seeks to lead. The agenda she presents and the campaign she wages are bound to reflect these facts.\par \par \uc2 In 1996, Bill \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's winning coalition was 73% white, 17% African-American, 7% Latino and 1% Asian. In 2012, \uc2 Barack Obama\uc2 's majority was 55% white, 25% African-American, 14% Latino and 4% Asian. Twenty years ago, nonwhite voters comprised only one in four Democrats; today, the ratio is more than four in 10. While whites make up 90% of the Republican electorate, Democrats may well be a majority-minority party by the middle of the next decade.\par \par \uc2 Much of this shift reflects underlying changes in the U.S. population. Some of it reflects higher turnout among minority voters. Relatively little of it is attributable to changing preferences among minority groups. After all, Bob Dole received only 21% of the Latino vote in 1996, a percentage even lower than Mr. Romney's 27% in 2012.\par \par \uc2 The ideological changes of the past two decades are equally significant. When Bill \uc2 Clinton\uc2  won re-\uc2 election\uc2  in 1996, only 16% of the electorate considered itself liberal, compared with 36% conservative and 38% moderate. By the beginning of 2016, the liberal share had risen to 24%, while moderates declined to 35% and conservatives remained steady at 37%.\par \par \uc2 These shifts have transformed the ideological composition of the Democratic Party, as a January 2016 Gallup report helped underline. During the mid-1990s, moderates constituted a strong plurality of Democrats, enjoying an edge of about 20 percentage points over liberals. As recently as 2000, moderates stood at 44% of the party, compared with the liberals' 29%. But the past 15 years have witnessed rapid changes. Liberals surged by 16 points to 45% while moderates dropped by nine points to 35% and conservatives by eight points to only 17%. If these trends continue, the Democratic Party will have a liberal majority in the 2024 \uc2 election\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Not surprisingly, Democratic presidential nominees have become much more reliant on liberal voters during this period. In 1996, Bill \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's electoral coalition was 55% moderate, 31% liberal and 14% conservative. Sixteen years later, \uc2 Barack Obama\uc2 's support was evenly balanced between liberals and moderates. When the votes are counted this November, the Democratic nominee's liberal supporters could outnumber moderates for the first time since survey researchers started asking about voters' ideological self-identification decades ago.\par \par \uc2 Self-identified "social" liberals have grown rapidly as a share of the Democratic Party, from 35% in 2001 to a dominant 57% in May of this year. Despite some visible shifts on gay rights and same-sex marriage within the ranks of the GOP, by contrast, only 10% of Republicans call themselves liberal on social issues.\par \par \uc2 When it comes to the economy, the picture is very different. Only 41% of Democrats identify as liberals on economic policy, barely more than the 37% who consider themselves moderate. In the electorate as a whole, economic conservatives outnumber economic liberals by two to one, compared with parity between conservatives and liberals on social issues.\par \par \uc2 White Democrats are far more likely to self-identify as liberal (50%) than are Hispanic and African-American Democrats (35% and 27%, respectively). This helps explain why \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  kept outpolling the more aggressively liberal Bernie Sanders among minorities in the primaries.\par \par \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  has more room for discretionary judgment on economic issues than on social ones. Any Democratic nominee would stand unflinchingly for civil rights, voting rights, women's rights (including the right to choose whether to terminate a pregnancy), equal pay for women and equal opportunity to participate in the workforce, LGBTQ rights, comprehensive immigration reform, fighting climate change, and environmental protection. The party would expect and accept nothing less.\par \par \uc2 On the economy, the Democratic electorate's views are less well-defined. To be sure, most Democrats believe that energetic government is needed to promote vigorous economic growth whose fruits are broadly shared. Beyond that agreement in principle, there is room for disagreement about fiscal policy, the type and scope of public investment, financial regulation, the best way to help financially hard-pressed college students, and (despite the tenor of the recent nominating contest) international trade.\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 Clinton\uc2 -Kaine ticket accurately represents today's Democratic Party -- united on social liberalism, tugged between moderates and progressives on economics. \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  has plenty of political space to champion an economic program that promotes both growth and inclusion -- without scaring off the socially liberal but economically moderate Democrats and suburban Republicans she will need to counter \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2 's mobilization of white working-class voters. Having given ground on the party's platform, her overriding task is to construct a national majority.\par \par \uc2 (See related letter: "Letters to the Editor: Whither 'Ask Not What Your Country Can Do for You'?" -- WSJ August 10, 2016)\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=wjco20160727000070"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document J000000020160727ec7r0002e\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved.  \par \par \uc2 To the Editor:\par \par \uc2 Re ''Democrats Fight to Pull Together on an Unruly Day'' (front page, July 26):\par \par \uc2 While the disruptive behavior of some particularly vocal Bernie Sanders supporters at the Democratic National Convention has been childish, there is an important warning lurking within those choruses of boos.\par \par \uc2 The Republican Party dismissed its angry fringe, only to find that fringe much larger than it suspected. That the Republican elites were surprised by \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2 's ascendancy only underscores how out of touch they were with the concerns of much of their constituency.\par \par \uc2 The Democrats should not make the same mistake. Regardless of Bernie Sanders's own calls for unity, there are thousands of very angry progressives feeling that their desires and fears are not being addressed.\par \par \uc2 If \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  and the Democratic establishment are wise, they will find as many ways as possible to reassure this demographic, rather than (as \uc2 WikiLeaks\uc2  reveals) trying to suppress them.\par \par \uc2 Otherwise, by the next \uc2 election\uc2  cycle, the party leadership may discover that there are worse alternatives than Bernie Sanders -- the leftist equivalent of \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2 , as it were -- that no firewall of superdelegates will save them, or the rest of us, from.\par \par \uc2 DAVID NURENBERG\par \par \uc2 Somerville, Mass.\par \par \uc2 To the Editor:\par \par \uc2 If \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  would like the Bernie Sanders supporters to stop booing and consider voting for her, she should address the email leak at the \uc2 Democratic National Committee\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 She needs to openly disavow the behavior of \uc2 Debbie Wasserman Schultz\uc2 , the departing chairwoman of the D.N.C., promise that Ms. Wasserman Schultz will have no role in a \uc2 Clinton\uc2  administration, and apologize for the blatant favoritism that the committee showed to her campaign.\par \par \uc2 Until Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  does this, this episode is just one more example of why so many people cannot trust her.\par \par \uc2 ANNE WALSH\par \par \uc2 New London, N.H.\par \par \uc2 To the Editor:\par \par \uc2 It is impossible for me to understand why Bernie Sanders's supporters hesitate to get behind \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 . They have their heads in the sand if they think a \uc2 Trump\uc2  presidency would be the same as a \uc2 Clinton\uc2  one in any way, shape or form!\par \par \uc2 If they care about nothing else, Supreme Court appointments and climate change should get their attention. The reason many young people today do not understand compromise is that they were raised in a world where everyone gets a trophy! From preschool on they got awards just for participating.\par \par \uc2 In the real world everyone does not win all the time. They have a few months to wake up to this reality and realize the vast difference in what the two major parties represent.\par \par \uc2 KIT MILLER\par \par \uc2 Walnut Creek, Calif.\par \par \uc2 To the Editor:\par \par \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  wants to unify the Democratic Party to get Bernie Sanders's supporters to vote for her. So let's come up with a way to strongly encourage her to promise him a prominent post in her administration, for example a cabinet post (there are 15 to choose from).\par \par \uc2 The secretary of health and human services comes to mind, since that post oversees Social Security and Medicare, among other things. Senator Sanders's supporters are more likely to vote for Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  if he is given a prominent administration post. This is an opportunity to keep Bernie Sanders working for the people.\par \par \uc2 JIM SULLIVAN\par \par \uc2 Ventura, Calif.\par \par \uc2 To the Editor:\par \par \uc2 Living at the top of the global pyramid comes with certain responsibilities. America at times seems incapable of grasping this, as the two conventions provide clear evidence.\par \par \uc2 The Democrats this week must realize that they have an awesome and terrifying responsibility, that the rest of the world is staring at them in utter disbelief, that the fate of the entire planet may lie in their hands.\par \par \uc2 You have an eminently capable candidate and an utterly inappropriate and very dangerous opponent. Take this opportunity with both hands and campaign as hard and as focused as you can. For all our sakes.\par \par \uc2 TOMMY WEIR\par \par \uc2 Dromahair, Ireland\par \par \uc2 Document NYTF000020160727ec7r0003c\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 ABROAD IN AMERICA\par \uc2 Foreign Desk; SECT\par \b \uc2 After a Convention's Bruising Start, a Party Struggles for Unity\b0\par\par\uc2 By DECLAN WALSH  \par \uc2 1,318 \uc2 words\par \uc2 27 July 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 The New York Times on the Web\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved.  \par \par \uc2 PHILADELPHIA -- The air was charged in the hotel ballroom where a few dozen young Democrats, wielding placards or wearing Robin Hood-style green hats, clustered at the rear of the room, waiting with an air of coiled anger.\par \par \uc2 Their political idol, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, was addressing a breakfast meeting of Democrats from California -- some of the thousands of delegates in town for this week's Democratic National Convention. But when Mr. Sanders urged the crowd to support his bitter rival, \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , who had beaten him to the party's nomination for president, the young Democrats erupted in a chorus of boos.\par \par \uc2 People clambered on chairs and shot their hands in the air. One made a thumbs-down sign. Older delegates, backing Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , turned and scowled. Mr. Sanders was forced to issue a reprimand.\par \par \uc2 ''It is easy to boo,'' he told his boisterous supporters, ''but it is harder to look your kids in the face who would be living under a Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  presidency.''\par \par \uc2 Hours later, Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  became the first woman ever nominated for president by a major political party. Her challenge now is to harness the passions that Mr. Sanders unleashed, overcome the deep-seated antipathy of many younger voters, and direct those energies toward victory in November.\par \par \uc2 Unity has been elusive for both of America's major political parties in this tumultuous \uc2 election\uc2  season, as new and unpredictable currents have shaken them to their core, driving them in opposite directions as they try to adopt to grinding changes in public opinion that will have still-unclear effects in November's presidential vote.\par \par \uc2 As with last week's Republican convention in Cleveland, the early days of the Democratic convention in this sweat-soaked city were marked by rowdy protests led by an insurgent minority determined to challenge the results of the primaries.\par \par \uc2 Ultimately, the vote was respected in both parties. Republicans defied their powerful Washington leadership to choose \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , a billionaire developer who has never held political office. Democrats went with their party's status quo favorite, Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Nonetheless, Mr. Sanders captured a sizable portion of the Democratic vote, energizing a hitherto hidden army of zealous supporters who, deeply disillusioned with mainstream candidates, represent a force similar to the one that has propelled Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  to prominence. And as they have made clear in the early overheated rounds of the convention in Philadelphia, they do not intend to fade away quietly.\par \par \uc2 ''People are no longer sleeping,'' said Nancy Kim, a Sanders supporter from Los Angeles. ''We're going to show the establishment we're not going anywhere. We're going to win next time.''\par \par \uc2 In many respects, the two conventions highlight the cultural, social and racial divides that slice down the middle of American politics. The Republican convention in Cleveland was overwhelmingly white and elderly, and with its ad hominem attacks on Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  and denunciations of foreign enemies, often had the air of a prize fight.\par \par \uc2 This week's Democratic gathering has the more sprawling, casual air of a baseball game. In a giant sports hall, delegates -- many of them African-American, Latino or from other minority groups -- dance in their seats between speakers, holding aloft slogans like ''Love trumps hate'' and ''Juntos se puede,'' Spanish for ''Together we can'' -- a pointed rebuke to Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's proposed wall along the border with Mexico. The speeches, some delivered by civil rights heroes and Hollywood celebrities, are both more polished and more anodyne than the Republican ones.\par \par \uc2 Yet the raw wounds of the primary contest are never far from the surface. Mr. Sanders had complained that the contest was tilted in Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's favor; his supporters are furious about her significant advantage in support from superdelegates: influential party officials who control large batches of votes.\par \par \uc2 On Day 1, the party leadership made a concerted effort to bring them into Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's camp. Sarah Silverman, the comedian and prominent Sanders supporter, urged them to support Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 . The first lady, \uc2 Michelle Obama\uc2 , gave a soaring address that left some delegates in tears.\par \par \uc2 Paul Simon sang ''Bridge Over Troubled Water.''\par \par \uc2 Yet tensions burned like a fuse. The publication, a few days earlier, of 20,000 emails stolen from the Democratic leadership's computers, which showed party officials favoring Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , fueled a sense of victimization. Sanders supporters massed outside the Metro station near the arena, forcing its shutdown for a time. They mounted protests in the hall corridors, sometimes chanting ''super predators'' against the superdelegates.\par \par \uc2 At the breakfast meeting on Tuesday, Michael Hsu led the booing against Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 . A group of opposing delegates -- older women from New York -- shouted in front of him ''basta!'' -- enough. Mr. Hsu, 35, from California, said he was protesting what he termed the \uc2 Clinton\uc2  campaign's ''politics of fear.''\par \par \uc2 ''They want us to vote out of fear, but fear cannot defeat hate,'' he said.\par \par \uc2 But a few tables away, other delegates said the Sanders campaign had opened divisions with minority groups that are staunch \uc2 Clinton\uc2  backers. Karen Willis, an African-American lawyer from San Diego, said Mr. Sanders had created a ''monster'' that had gotten out of his control.\par \par \uc2 ''Now, even if he shows them the way, they boo him,'' she said. ''We want them kicked out. This will never happen again.''\par \par \uc2 The ranks of the Sanders supporters, she continued, were ''95 percent white and have about as many blacks as \uc2 Trump\uc2 . And they're just about as weird and out there.''\par \par \uc2 When Sanders supporters looked as though they might started heckling Mrs. Obama during her speech on Monday, Ms. Willis added, they got a robust warning from nearby black delegates. ''We were ready,'' she said. ''There was so much anger and rage.''\par \par \uc2 Still, there's no doubting that Mr. Sanders has awakened the Democratic base in a year when it faces a mercurial opponent in Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 . And as well as attracting new voters, it has revitalized some old ones.\par \par \uc2 At lunchtime on Tuesday, Lynn Rugh and a friend, both from Connecticut, waited for cheesesteak sandwiches, the Philadelphia signature dish, at a bustling food court in the city center.\par \par \uc2 Having returned to the Democratic fold under Mr. Sanders, after years of absence from political engagement, Ms. Rugh said it would be ''extraordinarily difficult'' to reconcile herself to supporting Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , whom she described as a pro-war candidate in the grip of big business.\par \par \uc2 Could anything change her mind? ''Maybe if Hillary turns herself in,'' she said, referring to an investigation into Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's conduct regarding classification procedures while at the State Department. ''I'm still hoping she'll be dragged offstage by the F.B.I.''\par \par \uc2 Other delegates, though, were confident the party would unite once the passions of the early part of the convention had cooled. ''It might be distasteful for the purists, but we have to work together,'' said Anila Ali, a delegate from California.\par \par \uc2 And late on Tuesday afternoon, after delegates on the floor called out their votes, Mr. Sanders himself, with the Vermont delegation, quietly accepted his fate. After Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  had passed the threshold of votes required to officially secure the nomination, he announced that he was ceding all of his support to Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 As celebrations gripped the arena, Mr. Sanders left his seat and walked toward the back of the hall. The song ''Happy'' played as \uc2 Clinton\uc2  supporters danced in their seats. Some Sanders supporters stood with their placards, their eyes glazed with tears. Others had already left, their empty red seats visible in corners of the auditorium.\par \par \uc2 Abroad in America, written by a Times foreign correspondent, approaches the \uc2 election\uc2  in much the same way as we would events overseas, deciphering the action for a global audience.\par \par \uc2 Follow Declan Walsh on Twitter @declanwalsh .\par \par \uc2 Document NYTF000020160727ec7r0003h\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw272\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4080\pichgoal600

\par\par \b \uc2 Clinton\uc2  Wins Historic Nomination --- For Some Women, Gender Isn't Enough\b0\par\par\uc2 By Colleen McCain Nelson and Janet Adamy   \par \uc2 1,266 \uc2 words\par \uc2 27 July 2016\par \uc2 The Wall Street Journal\par \uc2 J\par A1\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 The nomination of \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  marked a step forward in the fight for equality in postwar America that illustrates the strides made by women since the former first lady was born in 1947.\par \par \uc2 The irony -- and the problem for Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  -- is that such progress has become so widespread that some women voters appear indifferent to another glass ceiling shattered. More women graduate from college than men. They are the main breadwinners in four of 10 U.S. households. They run \uc2 General Motors Co\uc2 ., \uc2 PepsiCo Inc\uc2 . and \uc2 IBM Corp\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , who was formally picked Tuesday evening as the Democratic nominee, has struggled to lock up support from middle-aged white women. And some younger women see little urgency to crash barriers they haven't encountered.\par \par \uc2 While 52% of registered female voters from both parties support Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  the proportion falls to 36% among white women ages 50 to 64 and 34% among white women ages 35 to 49, according to a Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll this month.\par \par \uc2 Republican presidential candidate \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  is supported by 37% of all women in the poll, 54% of white women ages 50 to 64, and 51% of those women ages 35 to 49.\par \par \uc2 "What bothers me the most is that there's not very much excitement about Hillary being the first woman," said 72-year-old tennis champion and \uc2 Clinton\uc2  supporter Billie Jean King, especially not when compared with the enthusiasm of Americans during the campaign to elect \uc2 Barack Obama\uc2  as the first black president.\par \par \uc2 Concerns about Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  include the revelation she used her personal email for government purposes while serving as secretary of state. Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  has said she made a mistake but didn't break the rules set at the time.\par \par \uc2 Reservations and resentment also linger from the Clintons' service in the White House during the 1990s, when her husband, President \uc2 Bill \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , was impeached for lying in the investigation of his affair with a White House intern.\par \par \uc2 Conservatives part ways with Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  on such issues as abortion rights, and liberals assert she has been too cozy with Wall Street.\par \par \uc2 "I think we have gotten away from the historic nature of this campaign because \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  has become an exceptionally polarizing candidate," said Democratic pollster \uc2 Peter Hart\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's highest levels of support among all women registered to vote, including Republicans, are from those ages 65 and older -- 56% -- and 66% for ages 18 to 34. Millennials are among the most liberal voters.\par \par \uc2 "The younger generation expects that there will be a woman president, expects that they will do any single thing that they want," said Sherry Lansing, 71 years old, who became the first female president of a movie studio at \uc2 Twentieth Century Fox\uc2  in 1980. She is backing Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 A mid-2015 list counted 24 female chief executives at Fortune 500 companies, the same number from the prior year, raising concerns of stalled progress.\par \par \uc2 When Ms. Lansing grew up in Chicago in the 1950s, she said, women were told they had two career choices: teacher or nurse. And those professions were often seen as placeholders until marriage and children. It wasn't, she said, until \uc2 Gloria Steinem\uc2  agitated for equal treatment of women in the 1960s that she saw a different path.\par \par \uc2 Progress came in fits and starts during Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's lifetime. When Hillary Rodham was born in Chicago, eight women served in Congress.No state had a female governor. The president's cabinet was all male.\par \par \uc2 Democrat Patricia Schroeder was elected to the House of Representative in 1972, pushing the number of women in Congress to 16 of 535 seats. When she launched her first congressional campaign, a local newspaper published the headline: "Housewife announces for Congress."\par \par \uc2 "There's nothing wrong with being a housewife," Ms. Schroeder said in a recent interview. "But I was an attorney."\par \par \uc2 Her family bought a house in Virginia after the \uc2 election\uc2 , she said, and Ms. Schroeder wasn't permitted to sign the closing papers because she was of childbearing age. When Ms. Schroeder needed supplies for her office, she couldn't secure a credit card in her own name.\par \par \uc2 "You've got to be kidding me -- I just got elected to Congress," she said. "We got busy and passed the Equal Credit Opportunity Act."\par \par \uc2 Former Republican Sen. Elizabeth Dole entered Harvard Law School in 1962 and was one of 24 women in a class of 550. Mrs. Dole, who later served as a cabinet secretary in two administrations, said a male classmate asked: "What are you doing here? Don't you realize you're taking the place of a man who would give his right arm to be in this law school, a man who would use his legal education?"\par \par \uc2 In 1973, retired tennis champion Bobby Riggs asserted that the men's game was superior to women's tennis and challenged Ms. King to a match dubbed the "Battle of the Sexes." She beat him soundly.\par \par \uc2 When the 2016 presidential field became dominated by Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  and Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , Ms. King said, it reminded her of that match. "Bobby talked, talked, talked, talked, talked," she said. "He couldn't get enough attention. Does that remind you of anybody?"\par \par \uc2 A spokeswoman for Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , Hope Hicks, said: "The difference is that Bobby Riggs choked, and Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  never chokes."\par \par \uc2 Unease with Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  has colored this historic moment. WSJ/NBC polls over the past 10 years found Americans more enthusiastic about electing a female president. But when respondents were asked their support of Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  in that role, their enthusiasm is dimmed from a decade ago.\par \par \uc2 "It never occurred to me that a woman couldn't be president," said Susan Willes, a 53-year-old undecided Democrat and nurse from Timonium, Md. "I don't feel like I have to vote for a woman just because she's a woman."\par \par \uc2 Nancy Pelosi\uc2 , who became the first female House Speaker in 2007, said she expects Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  to win, not because "it's time" to elect a woman president, but because she is the best choice.\par \par \uc2 Historian Doris Kearns Goodwin said one of the milestones that helped pave a path for Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  was former U.S. Rep. Geraldine Ferraro's unsuccessful Democratic run for vice president in 1984. Now, three decades later, Ms. Goodwin said she was surprised it has taken so long to reach this point.\par \par \uc2 Sending a woman to the White House, Ms. Goodwin said, "may make a difference in terms of young girls seeing this happen, and then they can picture themselves doing it."\par \par \uc2 Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  has embraced the history-making component of her candidacy after shying away from it during her 2008 campaign. Eight years ago, she and her advisers concentrated on showing she was prepared to be president, making only occasional mentions of the historic nature of her candidacy.\par \par \uc2 During this campaign, she told voters that if standing up for women's issues "is playing the women card, then deal me in."\par \par \uc2 Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  celebrated clinching the last of the delegates needed to win the nomination at a rally in Brooklyn last month, saying her "campaign is about making sure there are no ceilings, no limits, on any of us."\par \par \uc2 (See related article: "After Tough Battle, A Historic Choice" -- WSJ July 27, 2016)\par \par \uc2 (See related letters: "Letters to the Editor: Gender Isn't Enough; Character Counts, Too" -- WSJ August 4, 2016)\par \par {\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw262\pich213\picscaley75\picscalex75\picwgoal5240\pichgoal4260

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 Corrections & Amplifications\par \par \uc2 Protesters voiced criticism on several issues at a second public address that New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo gave Tuesday at the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia. In some editions Wednesday, an article about Mr. Cuomo mentioned only criticism of the governor's executive order related to a boycott movement against Israel.\par \par \uc2 (WSJ July 28, 2016)\par \par \uc2 (END)\par \par \uc2 PHILADELPHIA -- Away from his home turf, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo spent his first day at the Democratic National Convention contending with pockets of the party where he is less than popular.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Cuomo, who four years ago at the convention in Charlotte, N.C., shunned all but a minor address to New York delegates and declined to stay overnight, traveled to Philadelphia to participate more fully this time and has a speaking role later in the week.\par \par \uc2 But on Tuesday he felt the effects of an emboldened Democratic left wing that has been determined to make its voice heard during the convention. Appearing at a breakfast for the New York delegation alongside Bernie Sanders, Mr. Cuomo praised the Vermont senator's presidential campaign and both politicians entered to a standing ovation.\par \par \uc2 "I also want to applaud the senator for keeping his eye on the ball," Mr. Cuomo said, to cheers. "The goal for the Democratic Party is to make sure [Donald] \uc2 Trump\uc2  and that philosophy has no place in this country, ever."\par \par \uc2 But even as Mr. Sanders congratulated Mr. Cuomo for raising the statewide minimum wage and instituting a paid family-leave program, Sanders backers said they have already begun organizing to oppose Mr. Cuomo's re-\uc2 election\uc2  bid in 2018.\par \par \uc2 Asked if she was a supporter of the New York governor, Sanders delegate and Queens resident Nancy de Delva said: "I'm definitely not."\par \par \uc2 "All of his ideas are more Republican," said Ms. de Delva.\par \par \uc2 She said she wasn't appeased by the governor's efforts on progressive ideals such as raising the minimum wage. "These were not his ideas. Mayor de Blasio wanted all this from the beginning," she said.\par \par \uc2 A spokesman for Mr. Cuomo pointed out that the governor had long supported increases to the minimum wage, including before Mr. de Blasio became mayor, and took unilateral actions to raise it for fast-food workers and others prior to this year.\par \par \uc2 Poornima Subramanian, a University of Buffalo pharmacy student, said fellow Sanders delegates have already selected a 2018 candidate: "We'd like to see [New York Attorney General] Eric Schneiderman run against \uc2 Andrew Cuomo\uc2 ." Mr. Schneiderman has said that he doesn't intend to do that.\par \par \uc2 At Mr. Cuomo's other public address of the day, to the Democratic Party's lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender caucus, he faced a more receptive crowd. He drew hearty applause for signing legislation legalizing same-sex marriage in New York and for describing the June mass shooting in Orlando, Fla., as "a terrorist attack on gay Americans."\par \par \uc2 Still, even among friendly faces, Mr. Cuomo encountered some detractors in the form of protesters who disrupted his speech to criticize him for an executive order to force state agencies to divest themselves of companies supporting a Palestinian-backed boycott movement against Israel.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Cuomo recovered quickly from the disruption, and he was soon met with another vocal crowd member with a more supportive message concerning the state's embrace of same-sex marriage rights.\par \par \uc2 Shouted one woman in the audience: "We did it by having the best governor ever in New York!"\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=wjco20160727000136"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document J000000020160727ec7r00048\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw272\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4080\pichgoal600

\par\par \b \uc2 The Democratic Convention: Economic Messages Reveal Tensions --- \uc2 Clinton\uc2  trumpets gains and policy proposals, as party's progressives focus on shortcomings\b0\par\par\uc2 By Nick Timiraos and Richard Rubin   \par \uc2 732 \uc2 words\par \uc2 27 July 2016\par \uc2 The Wall Street Journal\par \uc2 J\par A4\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 Headline speakers at this week's Democratic convention are offering jarringly different visions of the state of America's economy, revealing one of the harder questions for presidential nominee \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  to answer this fall: How good is the economy, anyway?\par \par \uc2 President \uc2 Barack Obama\uc2  regularly emphasizes a job-creation record that he says has made the U.S. recovery the envy of the world. But progressive leaders, including Sens. Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, highlighted a litany of economic shortcomings in prime-time speeches on the convention's kickoff night, including what Mr. Sanders called a "grotesque" level of income inequality.\par \par \uc2 Despite progress, "we can all agree that much, much more needs to be done," Mr. Sanders said.\par \par \uc2 This tension animates Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's economic message, which highlights the upswings under both the \uc2 Clinton\uc2  and Obama administrations while offering policies shaped by perceived shortcomings of those expansions.\par \par \uc2 Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  has called for a big infrastructure-spending package to boost growth, along with other proposals that rely on tax credits, regulations and other policy nudges to ensure more households benefit from economic expansions. She wants to expand paid family leave and sharply reduce what Americans pay in college tuition.\par \par \uc2 The question is whether the sum of her ideas will motivate voters during a season of robust antiestablishment appeal.\par \par \uc2 Nominees typically put forward policy proposals with enough specifics to claim a mandate and push their plans through Congress after the \uc2 election\uc2 . Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  is following that script with a platform culled from think tanks and experts, but she is up against an opponent, \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2 , who says voters don't care about detailed policies and offers only broad aims that are largely untethered from the Republican Party's longtime ideology.\par \par \uc2 Republicans, too, have faced divisions, but party regulars said Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  has broad appeal to conservatives and independents. "It's especially stark when people see how far left the Democratic Party has gone to accommodate Bernie Sanders," said Judd Gregg, a former New Hampshire governor and senator.\par \par \uc2 Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's proposals are aimed at updating U.S. policies and laws to reflect how people live and work today, said Jacob Leibenluft, a senior policy adviser to the campaign\par \par \uc2 "She's laid out an agenda that she believes is achievable, and that's important," he said. "This is not some sort of tempering of our ambition because we think it's achievable."\par \par \uc2 Officials who backed Mr. Sanders, her primary rival, say the platform approved at the convention is the most progressive in modern times. They want Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  to override instincts that some say have made her too cautious.\par \par \uc2 The platform takes on "inequality [and] a campaign system being corrupted by special-interest money," said Sen. Jeff Merkley (D., Ore.). "I hope she will recognize there is room politically to take on these issues."\par \par \uc2 There is little doubt that Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  takes over a much-changed party.\par \par \uc2 The financial crisis shattered confidence in markets and curbed the party's embrace of Wall Street that began under Mr. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  in the 1990s. Difficulty in translating steady job gains under Mr. Obama into higher incomes for Americans complicates Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's effort to run on an otherwise sturdy economic record.\par \par \uc2 "What we've learned since the 1990s is that economic growth is necessary, but not sufficient," said Alan Krueger, the Princeton University economist who chaired Mr. Obama's Council of Economic Advisers.\par \par \uc2 Populist impulses coursed through both parties' primaries. Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  steered Republicans away from their focus on limited government and free trade, but Mr. Sanders pulled Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  toward the party's liberal base.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Sanders channeled frustrations into a serious primary challenge. Under pressure, Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  moved his way on some issues. She also rejected the Pacific trade deal she had lauded as Mr. Obama's secretary of state.\par \par \uc2 Barring a crisis, Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  can point to a modestly expanding economy with unemployment below 5%. Some 49% of respondents in the latest Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll said the economy had improved and that Mr. Obama deserved some credit, while 36% said the economy had not improved. Whether she stands to benefit is an open question.\par \par {\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw262\pich211\picscaley75\picscalex75\picwgoal5240\pichgoal4220

\par\par \uc2 Politics; SECT\par \b \uc2 Democratic Convention Day 2 Takeaways: History Is Made\b0\par\par\uc2 By ALEXANDER BURNS \par \uc2 968 \uc2 words\par \uc2 27 July 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 The New York Times on the Web\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 PHILADELPHIA -- After formally voting to nominate \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , Democrats capped the occasion with a surprise appearance by their new standard-bearer. Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  briefly addressed the convention from New York, hailing the vote as a historic moment for American women. But before her cameo, a lineup of Democrats offered revealing testimonials to Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  -- and new signals about how they plan to contest the fall campaign. Our takeaways:\par \par \uc2 Bill \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's 'change' pitch\par \par \uc2 Former President \uc2 Bill \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's speech offered an intimate tribute to Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , describing for a rapt audience their courtship and early marriage -- and their upward climb together in politics.\par \par \uc2 His most telling praise, however, was about Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's grit as a reformer. With \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2  casting the 2016 \uc2 election\uc2  as a choice between drastic change and an unhappy status quo, the former president insisted that Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , rather than her opponent, is best prepared to wrest change from an unwilling system.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  asked voters to cast aside the ''cartoon'' version of Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  promoted by Republicans, and urged them to think optimistically about the future. ''Life in the real world is complicated, and real change is hard,'' he said. Of his wife, Mr. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  said, ''She is the best darn change-maker I have ever known.''\par \par \uc2 Democrats have long aimed to beat Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  by discrediting his promises of change. But Mr. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's speech confirmed that Democrats know they must do more than that, and that they must compete hard for the votes of people who want Washington overhauled from top to bottom.\par \par \uc2 Leaning into the Russian connection\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  was rarely mentioned on Tuesday night; the night's headliner, Mr. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , did not mention him at all. But the most prominent speakers who went after Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  attacked him on a notable theme: his friendly stance toward President \uc2 Vladimir V. Putin\uc2  of Russia.\par \par \uc2 Gov. Terry McAuliffe\uc2  of Virginia warned against ''giving the nuclear codes to a man who praises \uc2 Vladimir Putin\uc2  and Saddam Hussein.'' Madeleine Albright, a former secretary of state, rebuked Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  for praising those two leaders and Kim Jong-un, the leader of North Korea. And she alluded to the release of hacked emails from the \uc2 Democratic National Committee\uc2  to suggest outright that Russia is boosting Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 ''Putin is eager to see \uc2 Trump\uc2  win,'' Ms. Albright said, ''and that should worry every American.''\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  has dismissed suggestions that Mr. Putin is trying to help him, but he has also not shied away from praising the Russian strongman. Democrats signaled that they intend to tie him closely to Mr. Putin in the fall campaign.\par \par \uc2 A careful message on policing and civil rights\par \par \uc2 Republicans had a simple message last week on policing, led by Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's blunt calls for stronger ''law and order.'' Democrats had to deliver a more nuanced set of views -- voicing the party's mounting concerns about racial bias in policing, while paying tribute to law enforcement amid a rash of police killings.\par \par \uc2 That textured message came through in a series of speeches by lower-profile figures: black mothers who lost children to gun violence and in run-ins with the police, and a former New York City police detective who helped handle the aftermath of the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. And \uc2 Eric H. Holder Jr\uc2 ., a former United States attorney general, called both for defending the police and for attacking inequities in the justice system.\par \par \uc2 ''The majority of police officers are good people doing a good job,'' said Lucia McBath, the mother of a black teenager in Florida who was shot and killed by a driver after an argument over loud music. ''And we're also going to keep using our voices and our votes to support leaders like \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , who will help us protect one another so that this club of heartbroken mothers stops growing.''\par \par \uc2 The revolution peters out\par \par \uc2 The worst of the Bernie Sanders-bloc tantrums may be over. After the roll-call vote that anointed Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  the Democratic nominee, dozens of Sanders supporters stormed out and encamped in one of the media tents, holding forth to throngs of reporters about their anger at the party and its presidential candidate.\par \par \uc2 But inside the hall, the loud disruptions of Monday evening had faded. When Mr. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  mentioned the trade deals of the 1990s, which Mr. Sanders has blasted, there was no jeering from the crowd. Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  will still have to shore up her support on the left, but the Democratic nightmare scenario -- a convention plunged into chaos and recriminations -- appears to have been averted.\par \par \uc2 It was '90s night in Philadelphia\par \par \uc2 For a party with an image of relative youth and dynamism, the Democrats showcased a very familiar set of faces. At times, the speaking lineup could have come out of a Democratic convention in 1996 or 2000: Ms. Albright; Mr. McAuliffe, a longtime \uc2 Clinton\uc2  ally; Donna Brazile, the acting party chairwoman who managed Al Gore's 2000 campaign; and, most of all, Mr. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  himself.\par \par \uc2 There were newer stars who spoke on Monday -- like Senators Elizabeth Warren and \uc2 Cory Booker\uc2  -- and others set to speak later in the week. But the convention's second night highlighted the durability of a party establishment that has managed Democratic politics, on and off, for a quarter-century, holding onto power even during the anti-establishment 2016 campaign.\par \par \uc2 The lineup was striking, in part, because of the absence of similar leaders last week at the Republican National Convention, as the Bush family and its political network mostly sit out the 2016 race.\par \par \uc2 Find out what you need to know about the 2016 presidential race today, and get politics news updates via \uc2 Facebook\uc2 , \uc2 Twitter\uc2  and the First Draft newsletter.\par \par \uc2 Document NYTF000020160727ec7r0004d\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 PHILADELPHIA -- The Democratic convention formally nominated \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  for president on Tuesday, making history by choosing a woman to be the first standard-bearer of a major political party, a breakthrough underscored by a deeply personal speech by \uc2 Bill \uc2 Clinton\uc2  calling her ''the best darn change-maker I have ever known.''\par \par \uc2 At 6:39 p.m., the hall erupted in cheers and joyful tears as South Dakota cast the decisive 15 votes to put Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  over the threshold of 2,382 delegates required to clinch the nomination.\par \par \uc2 A sea of delegates waved multicolored signs with Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's ''H'' campaign logo, while others fell into hugs and several women jumped up and down with elation.\par \par \uc2 Vince Insalaco, the chairman of the Democratic Party of Arkansas, where the Clintons built their public profile over two decades, said the choice of the first female presidential nominee was a historic moment.\par \par \uc2 ''I'm so proud to be a Democrat tonight,'' Mr. Insalaco said, ''and so proud that we can call this woman one of our own.''\par \par \uc2 Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's primary rival, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, played a symbolic role in hopes of unifying the party behind her. After Vermont arranged to go last in the roll call, Mr. Sanders joined its delegation to roars of ''Bernie, Bernie'' and called on the party to rally behind Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 But it was the appearance of Mr. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , shortly after 10 p.m., that stirred the crowd most, as he set out to share a more personal side of the sometimes-reserved former secretary of state.\par \par \uc2 Unspooling memories of their 45 years together, Mr. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  used warm and detailed anecdotes to argue that the couple's political enemies had spent decades creating a ''cartoon'' of his wife that he was now determined to puncture. Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  is among the most unpopular presidential nominees in modern history, and the former president appealed to the audience to see through the political attacks on her.\par \par \uc2 ''One is real,'' Mr. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  said of the divergent portrayals of his wife, ''the other is made up.'' He recalled the affection of Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's old friends, her empathy for those in need, and the praise she had won from Republicans as a senator and as secretary of state.\par \par \uc2 ''You nominated the real one,'' Mr. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  said to a long burst of applause. Seeming to realize that he had been speaking for 38 minutes, he added in classically loquacious \uc2 Bill \uc2 Clinton\uc2  fashion, ''We have to get back on schedule.''\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's testimony was so personal that he even appeared to obliquely invoke problems in the couple's marriage.\par \par \uc2 ''She'll never quit on you,'' he said. ''She never quit on me.''\par \par \uc2 Earlier in the evening, several dozen Sanders delegates paraded off in a coordinated demonstration against Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's nomination. Some of them said beforehand that they were attending their first Democratic convention and felt no party loyalty or compulsion to fall in line behind Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , whom they described as insufficiently progressive on new banking regulations, a $15 minimum wage, a ban on fracking and other issues.\par \par \uc2 ''I'm just not there yet in terms of supporting Hillary, because her words are only her words, and I don't fully trust that she'll act on our agenda,'' said Ingrid Olson, 38, a delegate from Iowa.\par \par \uc2 The final delegate count was 2,842 for Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , 1,865 for Mr. Sanders and 56 ''no votes.''\par \par \uc2 The scenes in the hall, and the huge street protests that continued through Tuesday night, were more fractious than those at the party's gathering in Denver in 2008. Back then, Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , defeated for the nomination, moved to stop the roll call and nominate \uc2 Barack Obama\uc2 . Her gesture, aimed at soothing the bitterness of the primary fight, helped her supporters make peace with Mr. Obama and embrace his barrier-breaking candidacy.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Sanders and Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  had their own brutal competition this year, and their policy differences were greater than those between Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  and Mr. Obama -- part of why many of Mr. Sanders's supporters are reluctant to get behind her.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's task was clear: to humanize his wife but also energize Democrats by flattering those in the hall and villainizing \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , the Republican nominee.\par \par \uc2 ''She never made fun of people with disabilities,'' Mr. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  said, referring to Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's mocking of a disabled reporter last year. ''She tried to empower them based on their abilities.''\par \par \uc2 Yet as Mr. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  recounted his wife's well-chronicled professional accomplishments, he also tried to paint a portrait of a mother who is not as well known. Recounting the day they moved their daughter, Chelsea, into her freshman dorm at \uc2 Stanford University\uc2 , Mr. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  recounted how Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  kept looking for ''one more drawer to put that liner paper in,'' reluctant to say goodbye to her only child.\par \par \uc2 The speech was extraordinary in its intimacy and in Mr. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's willingness to use their much-scrutinized marriage as a testament to her character. He began by recalling how he first met his future wife in 1971 at Yale Law School -- he so nervous, she full of confidence -- and spent almost 15 minutes describing courting her and proposing marriage three times before she said yes. At one point, trying to play a mind game, Mr. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  told her that she should move to Illinois or New York and run for office rather than marry him and have other young Democrats eclipse her.\par \par \uc2 ''They mean well, and they speak well, but none of them are as good as you are,'' Mr. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  told her about their political generation. ''She said: 'Are you out of your mind? Nobody would ever vote for me.' ''\par \par \uc2 The convention underwent a notable shift as the evening went on: Mr. Sanders was barely mentioned, a deliberate decision by the \uc2 Clinton\uc2  campaign officials who organized the lineup of speakers. Advisers said that, with Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  now the nominee, they wanted to focus on her character and political record, and on taking the fight to Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , rather than continuing to nod to Mr. Sanders and his primary fight.\par \par \uc2 The crowd was subdued for much of the evening, but in the most searing part, nine African-American mothers whose children were killed by gun violence or in encounters with the police took the stage to chants of ''Black lives matter.'' The women, who have been campaigning for Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  for months, described how she had sat with them privately to hear their stories and worked with them to promote gun-control measures.\par \par \uc2 One of the mothers, Lucia McBath -- whose 17-year-old son, Jordan Davis, was fatally shot after playing loud music in his car in 2012 -- said Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  ''isn't afraid to say black lives matter,'' a phrase Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  and other Republicans have derided by saying that all lives matter. But Ms. McBath also said Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  knew that Americans needed to come together to keep children safe.\par \par \uc2 ''We're going to keep building a future where police officers and communities of color work together in mutual respect,'' she said.\par \par \uc2 Convention organizers, apparently seeking a balance with the mothers, invited the Pittsburgh police chief, Cameron McLay, to speak earlier in the evening. But as Chief McLay spoke of fallen officers and called for a criminal justice overhaul, many in the hall carried on their conversations.\par \par \uc2 Democrats used Tuesday to appeal to some of their traditional constituencies, but they also highlighted Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's faith. A video was played in which she asked for a prayer and then joined a prayer circle, and an image on one of the screens for part of the evening showed a group of people laying hands on her.\par \par \uc2 It was a striking, and surely not accidental, contrast to the Republican convention last week, in which appeals to the faithful were somewhat muted and Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  scarcely mentioned faith in his acceptance speech.\par \par \uc2 The hosannas for Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  were in marked contrast to the steady stream of boos that rained down at the mention of her name on Monday. Still, the party's divisions remained in plain sight.\par \par \uc2 Many states announced that they had split their delegates by having representatives of Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  and Mr. Sanders speak separately. And it was clear that some Sanders supporters were not ready to give up. Tim Vandeveer, the chairman of the Hawaii Democratic Party, announced that Mr. Sanders had won a majority of the state's delegates, calling him ''the leader of our revolution, which shall continue.''\par \par \uc2 Later, as the convention wound down after 11 p.m., black and white images of every previous president flashed on the screen, which finally seemed to crack as a smiling Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  suddenly appeared by video connection.\par \par \uc2 The hall broke out in applause and shouts of excitement as Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  acknowledged breaking the glass ceiling.\par \par \uc2 ''If there are any little girls out there who stayed up late to watch,'' she said, ''let me just say, I may become the first woman president, but one of you is next.''\par \par \uc2 Find out what you need to know about the 2016 presidential race today, and get politics news updates via \uc2 Facebook\uc2 , \uc2 Twitter\uc2  and the First Draft newsletter.\par \par \uc2 Supporters of Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  celebrated after she was formally nominated, with 2,842 delegates to Bernie Sanders's 1,865.

But perhaps the most important message she and her campaign are trying to deliver this week is a scorching indictment of her Republican opponent as someone who has spared almost no group from insult or injury, be they veterans' widows, American Indians, immigrants, Muslims, the disabled or women.\par \par \uc2 Given Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's own weaknesses with many white voters -- especially men and those without college degrees -- and a trust deficit she must overcome with a majority of Americans, this is what Democratic coalition building looks like in the era of Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 If his support base is voters unsettled by changes that have reshaped the country, a key part of Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's is those unsettled by Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 The hope, as shown here in Philadelphia in video testimonials, character witnesses and footage of Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's own words, is to sow doubts not only about his character, but also about whether he genuinely cares about the working-class people to whom he has so much appeal.\par \par \uc2 ''You just saw what happened to me,'' the military widow, Cheryl Lankford, said in prime time Monday night, ''how \uc2 Trump\uc2  University cheated me out of the money I received after my husband's death.''\par \par \uc2 The Democratic Party, which painted the 2012 Republican candidate, \uc2 Mitt Romney\uc2 , as indifferent to the concerns of ordinary Americans, is now trying to do the same with Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 . ''One of the central questions in the \uc2 election\uc2  will be, 'Who do voters trust more to be on their side?''' said Geoff Garin, a pollster and strategist for the pro-\uc2 Clinton\uc2  ''super PAC'' Priorities USA Action. ''And one of the things that's being developed in the convention is \uc2 Trump\uc2 's long history of cheating people to enrich himself.''\par \par \uc2 Whit Ayres, a top Republican pollster, noted the similarities to the Romney strategy. ''They did it four years ago, but our nominee hadn't set the table for them quite as perfectly,'' he said.\par \par \uc2 If Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  can broaden her base to include working-class whites in particular, it could provide an insurance policy against low turnout among minority groups. But recent polling shows just how much work she has to do.\par \par \uc2 The latest New York Times/CBS News poll this month showed that Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  beats her 53 percent to 28 percent among white voters who do not have a bachelor's degree. Among white voters with a bachelor's degree or higher, she leads, 47 percent to 37 percent.\par \par \uc2 ''His strength is concentrated almost exclusively with non-college-educated whites,'' said Mark Mellman, a Democratic pollster. ''And when you put together college-educated whites with minority communities and the other groups that \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  has assaulted and insulted, it's a pretty big majority of the country.''\par \par \uc2 To many of Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's supporters, she is only doing what she has to do.\par \par \uc2 ''Good politics takes into account every single way you can get people out to vote,'' said Robert Kellogg, a delegate from Gastonia, N.C. ''We can't take what \uc2 Trump\uc2  says for granted.''\par \par \uc2 Mr. Ayres, the Republican pollster, said that he was doubtful Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  could improve her appeal much with blue-collar whites, likening it to ''trying to sell \uc2 Trump\uc2  to Latinos.''\par \par \uc2 But he added, ''It just looks like Democrats are trying to outvote them.''\par \par \uc2 Data from the primaries in key battleground states show that Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  has not expanded the Republican coalition to the point where he could make up the votes he is expected to lose elsewhere.\par \par \uc2 Optimus, an analytics firm that works for Republican campaigns, examined all the voters who cast ballots in primaries in states like Pennsylvania, Michigan, Florida and Ohio -- places Mr. Romney lost in 2012 but that Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  has said he can win by bringing new voters into the mix. Optimus found that with the exception of Florida, the number of new voters in the primaries would not have been enough to help Mr. Romney beat President Obama, which does not bode well for Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's chances in those states this year.\par \par \uc2 The bottom line, said Scott Tranter, a partner with Optimus, is that Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  will not win these states if he does not draw independents and Democrats as well.\par \par \uc2 ''\uc2 Trump\uc2  is not going to win the Romney way,'' Mr. Tranter said ''He's only going to win the \uc2 Trump\uc2  way. And that's by taking more swing voters than anyone thought was possible.''\par \par \uc2 And the more people Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  offends -- or who become offended by him because of efforts by Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  and her allies to highlight his flaws -- the harder it becomes for Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  to make up the votes he is losing in important demographic groups.\par \par \uc2 He is behind with white women, for instance, compared with how other recent Republican nominees have performed. The latest Times/CBS poll showed that he was tied with Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  among white female voters, a group Mr. Romney won 56 percent to Mr. Obama's 42 percent.\par \par \uc2 One of the recurring themes at the convention in Philadelphia has been Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's at times degrading treatment of women, including a video montage of him explaining how ''putting a wife to work is a very dangerous thing'' and telling a female reporter, ''You wouldn't have your job if you weren't beautiful.''\par \par \uc2 The last time a Democratic presidential candidate beat a Republican with white female voters was 1996, when \uc2 Bill \uc2 Clinton\uc2  won his second term.\par \par \uc2 At the end of his speech on Tuesday night, Mr. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  made a point of reaching out to Muslims who ''love America and freedom,'' and urged immigrants to side with Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's policies ''over someone who wants to send you back.''\par \par \uc2 Find out what you need to know about the 2016 presidential race today, and get politics news updates via \uc2 Facebook\uc2 , \uc2 Twitter\uc2  and the First Draft newsletter.\par \par \uc2 The Pledge of Allegiance preceded the roll call vote by delegates in Philadelphia on Tuesday.

\par\par \uc2 Q. AND A.\par \uc2 Business/Financial Desk; SECT\par \b \uc2 The Trans-Pacific Partnership Trade Accord Explained\b0\par\par\uc2 By KEVIN GRANVILLE \par \uc2 1,372 \uc2 words\par \uc2 27 July 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 The New York Times on the Web\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 The Trans-Pacific Partnership, the largest regional trade accord in history, would set new terms for trade and business investment among the United States and 11 other Pacific Rim nations -- a far-flung group with an annual gross domestic product of nearly $28 trillion that represents roughly 40 percent of global G.D.P. and one-third of world trade.\par \par \uc2 But the agreement, which requires the approval of Congress, has become a flashpoint in the United States presidential campaign, opposed by the nominees of both major parties as a symbol of failed globalism and the loss of United States jobs overseas.\par \par \uc2 The product of years of negotiations that culminated last fall with the endorsement of the 12 nations' trade chiefs, the Trans-Pacific Partnership was a hallmark victory for President Obama, who has pushed for a foreign policy ''pivot'' to the Pacific rim. It seeks to bind Pacific nations closer through lower tariffs while also serving as a buttress against China's growing regional influence. An independent study said that it would raise incomes and exports in the United States, but not jobs over all.\par \par \uc2 Many Democrats in Congress have voiced skepticism over the benefits. And opposition to the pact became a popular rallying cry in stump speeches by both \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , the Republican nominee, who has promised to tear up the deal, and Bernie Sanders, who argued during the Democratic presidential primaries that it would lead to a loss of jobs and competitive wages.\par \par \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , the Democratic nominee, supported the emerging Trans-Pacific Partnership as secretary of state, but during the primary race, soon after the accord was concluded, she said it did not sufficiently protect American jobs.\par \par \uc2 Supporters of the deal in the administration and the Republican-controlled Congress, realizing that prospects for passage would dim whoever wins the presidency, are holding out hope for a vote during the lame-duck session after the \uc2 election\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Why Has the Pact Been So Divisive?\par \par \uc2 Supporters say that it would be a boon for all the nations involved, that it would ''unlock opportunities'' and ''address vital 21st-century issues within the global economy,'' and that it is written in a way to encourage more countries, possibly even China, to sign on.\par \par \uc2 Opponents in the United States see the pact as mostly a giveaway to business, encouraging further export of manufacturing jobs to low-wage nations while limiting competition and encouraging higher prices for pharmaceuticals and other high-value products by spreading American standards for patent protections to other countries. A provision allowing multinational corporations to challenge regulations and court rulings before special tribunals is drawing intense opposition.\par \par \uc2 Why This, Why Now?\par \par \uc2 The pact is seen as a means of addressing a number of festering issues that have become stumbling blocks as global trade has soared, including e-commerce, financial services and cross-border internet communications.\par \par \uc2 There are also traditional trade issues involved. The United States is eager to establish formal trade agreements with five of the nations involved -- Japan, Malaysia, Brunei, New Zealand and Vietnam -- and to strengthen Nafta, its current agreement with Canada and Mexico.\par \par \uc2 Moreover, as efforts at global trade deals have faltered (such as the \uc2 World Trade Organization\uc2 's Doha round), the Trans-Pacific Partnership is billed as an ''open architecture'' document written to ease adoption by additional Asian nations, and to provide a potential template to other initiatives underway, like the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership.\par \par \uc2 What Are Some of the Issues Addressed by the Pact?\par \par \uc2 Tariffs and Quotas Long used to protect domestic industries from cheaper goods from overseas, tariffs on imports were once a standard, robust feature of trade policy, and generated much of the revenue for the United States Treasury in the 19th century. After the Depression and World War II, the United States led a movement toward freer trade.\par \par \uc2 Today, the United States and most developed countries have few tariffs, but some remain. The United States, for example, protects the domestic sugar market from lower-priced global suppliers and imposes tariffs on imported shoes, while Japan has steep surcharges on agricultural products including rice, beef and dairy. The pact is an effort to create a Pacific Rim free-trade zone.\par \par \uc2 Environmental, Labor and Intellectual Property Standards United States negotiators stress that the Pacific agreement seeks to level the playing field by imposing rigorous labor and environmental standards on trading partners, and supervision of intellectual property rights.\par \par \uc2 Data Flows The Pacific trade pact aims to address a number of issues that have arisen since previous agreements were negotiated. One is that countries agree not to block cross-border transfers of data over the internet, and not require that servers be located in the country in order to conduct business in that country. This proposal has drawn concern from some countries, Australia among them, that it could conflict with privacy laws and regulations against personal data stored offshore.\par \par \uc2 Services A big aim of the Pacific pact is enhancing opportunities for service industries, which account for most of the private jobs in the American economy. The United States has a competitive advantage in a range of services, including finance, engineering, software, education, legal and information technology. Although services are not subject to tariffs, nationality requirements and restrictions on investing are used by many developing countries to protect local businesses.\par \par \uc2 State-Operated Businesses United States negotiators have discussed the need to address favoritism often granted to state-owned business -- those directly or indirectly owned by the government. Although Vietnam and Malaysia have many such corporations, the United States has some too (the Postal Service and Fannie Mae, for example). The final agreement may include terms that seek to insure some competitive neutrality while keeping the door open to China's future acceptance of the pact.\par \par \uc2 Why Hasn't China Been In on the Talks?\par \par \uc2 China has viewed the pact with concern, seeing a potential threat as the United States tries to tighten its relationship with Asian trading partners. But senior Chinese officials have hinted that they might want to take part at some point. At the same time, the deal provides China some cover as it pursues its own trade agreements in the region, such as the Silk Road initiative in Central Asia.\par \par \uc2 United States officials, while making clear that they see the pact as part of an effort to counter China's influence in the region, say they are hopeful that the pact's ''open architecture'' eventually prompts China to join, along with other important economic powers like South Korea.\par \par \uc2 The Shadow of Nafta, and the Debate in Washington\par \par \uc2 Nafta\uc2 , signed by President \uc2 Bill \uc2 Clinton\uc2  in 1993, helped lead to a boom in trade among the United States, Mexico and Canada. All three countries exported more goods and services to the other two, cross-border investments grew, and the United States economy has added millions of jobs since then. But of course not all those trends were attributable to Nafta, and the benefits were not equal: The United States had a small trade surplus with Mexico when the pact was signed, but that quickly became a trade deficit that has widened to more than $50 billion a year.\par \par \uc2 Critics of Nafta also point out that job growth in the United States does not account for the loss of jobs to Mexico or Canada; the A.F.L.-C.I.O. contends about 700,000 United States jobs have been lost or displaced because of Nafta.\par \par \uc2 Nafta\uc2  was a significant victory for President \uc2 Clinton\uc2  after a difficult congressional battle, where he won support from just enough fellow Democrats to ensure passage. The votes were 234 to 200 in the House, and 61 to 38 in the Senate.\par \par \uc2 President Obama may yet win that kind of outcome. Working with Republican leadership in the House and Senate, he gained final approval for trade promotion authority, a critical step that allows the White House to present the trade package to Congress for a straight up-or-down vote, without amendments.\par \par \uc2 But the tortuous legislative process further soured relations with many fellow Democrats, as well as unions and progressive groups, who vehemently oppose the Trans-Pacific Partnership.\par \par \uc2 Document NYTF000020160727ec7r0006p\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 EDITORIAL\par \uc2 Editorial Desk; SECTA\par \b \uc2 The Putin-\uc2 Trump\uc2  Admiration Society\b0\par\par\uc2 By THE EDITORIAL BOARD \par \uc2 677 \uc2 words\par \uc2 27 July 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 26\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 One curious aspect of the 2016 presidential campaign has been \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2 's startling affinity for \uc2 Vladimir Putin\uc2 , the increasingly authoritarian president of Russia. Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  and Mr. Putin have spoken admiringly of each other; exhibited similar strongman tendencies; and seemed to share certain views, notably a disdain for \uc2 NATO\uc2 . But would Mr. Putin really interfere in the American presidential race to help Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , the Republican Party nominee, get elected over the Democratic nominee, \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 ?\par \par \uc2 As odd as that may sound, it is being considered a serious possibility after the release on Friday of nearly 20,000 emails stolen from the \uc2 Democratic National Committee\uc2 's computer servers, many of them embarrassing to Democratic leaders. The emails, made public by \uc2 WikiLeaks\uc2 , forced the swift resignation of the D.N.C.'s chairwoman, Representative \uc2 Debbie Wasserman Schultz\uc2 . And the Democrats expect more leaks.\par \par \uc2 It may take time to prove who was behind the cyberattacks, but American intelligence agencies have reportedly told the White House they have ''high confidence'' it was Russia. Several cybersecurity firms that examined the metadata said it looked like the work of two Russian intelligence agencies that last year conducted cyberoperations on the White House, the State Department and the Joint Chiefs of Staff. The F.B.I. is investigating.\par \par \uc2 There is nothing new about intelligence services for the United States and Russia hacking each other's computer systems or trying to covertly influence other countries' domestic politics. In recent years, Mr. Putin has invaded Ukraine, stoking political tensions there and in the Baltic States, and financed right-wing politicians across Europe; during the Cold War, the United States secretly tried to influence elections in Indonesia, Italy, Chile and Poland. What seems new here is the idea that a government would publicly disclose information it got from hacking into the computers of an American political party in order to influence an \uc2 election\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 The Democrats are eager to exploit a \uc2 Trump\uc2 -Putin connection. The notion that a foreign power, especially a newly aggressive Russia, might be trying to sway the \uc2 election\uc2  is antithetical to democratic principles and America's interests. As secretary of state, \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , who became the Democratic nominee on Tuesday, tried to create a better working relationship with Russia, on issues like arms control and Iran, but the effort ultimately failed. Mr. Putin could also be retaliating against Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  for real or imagined perfidies; he accused her of meddling in Russia's 2011 parliamentary \uc2 election\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  has dismissed the idea of a Russian intervention on his behalf as a joke. But his past words about Mr. Putin have caused some to suspect that Moscow would seek to give Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  an edge in the \uc2 election\uc2 . At a time when Russia is under sanctions for its Ukraine invasion and isolated from groups like the Group of 7, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  has made no secret of his admiration for Mr. Putin. He has even said Mr. Putin is ''a lot stronger than our leader.''\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's lack of commitment to the defense of \uc2 NATO\uc2  allies and his retreat from the world would unquestionably serve Mr. Putin's dream of unraveling the Western alliance and re-establishing Russia as a superpower. Although as a developer Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  never got the real estate foothold in Russia that he craved, he has spent 30 years courting Russian politicians. His campaign chairman, \uc2 Paul Manafort\uc2 , has extensive financial and political dealings with business executives in Russia and Ukraine, and served as a political strategist for Viktor Yanukovych, the deposed pro-Russia president of Ukraine.\par \par \uc2 If it is proved that Mr. Putin instigated the D.N.C. hack, it could backfire. But regardless of whether Mr. Putin is out to help Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , voters would be right to question the judgment of a candidate who has shown so much admiration for such a dangerous adversary.\par \par \uc2 Follow The \uc2 New York Times\uc2  Opinion section on \uc2 Facebook\uc2  and \uc2 Twitter\uc2  (@NYTOpinion), and sign up for the Opinion Today newsletter.\par \par \uc2 Document NYTF000020160727ec7r00070\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

SHEAR \par \uc2 1,190 \uc2 words\par \uc2 27 July 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 13\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 PHILADELPHIA -- Nobody knows better than President \uc2 Obama\uc2  how easy it would be for \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2  to reverse the policies of the past eight years if he defeats \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  this fall.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Obama\uc2  knows because he did it himself.\par \par \uc2 In the weeks after \uc2 Mr. Obama\uc2  won the White House in 2008, the president-elect met with his top legal advisers, political strategists and cabinet nominees to map out an aggressive plan to unwind the George W. Bush presidency. They prepared more than three dozen executive orders for the first year.\par \par \uc2 In the days immediately after he took office, \uc2 Mr. Obama\uc2  ended the use of torture, lifted Mr. Bush's ban on stem-cell research, relaxed enforcement of marijuana laws, blocked oil and gas leases on public lands, ordered the closing of the American prison at Guant\u225\'00\'E1namo Bay within a year, scrapped oil-shale development in the West, reversed restrictions on union organizing, overturned bans on the use of affirmative action by colleges and approved stricter emissions rules.\par \par \uc2 ''These were the kinds of conversations that we had, on an agency-by-agency basis, to see where corrections needed to be made,'' said \uc2 Eric H. Holder Jr\uc2 ., \uc2 Mr. Obama\uc2 's first attorney general. ''There's no question that a president can change course just by taking out the legal underpinnings of a particular policy.''\par \par \uc2 Eight years later, as \uc2 Mr. Obama\uc2  and the veterans of his administration gear up to help Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  get elected in November, there is no better motivation for them than the prospect of a President \uc2 Trump\uc2  ordering a similar reversal.\par \par \uc2 Driven by those fears, the president plans to campaign aggressively for Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  this fall. Aides have largely cleared his calendar in October, and barring new crises, the White House expects \uc2 Mr. Obama\uc2  to be on the campaign trail almost daily leading up to \uc2 Election\uc2  Day.\par \par \uc2 Based on what he has said, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  would probably use the power of the Oval Office to quickly overturn \uc2 Mr. Obama\uc2 's immigration actions, try to unravel the Affordable Care Act, order the \uc2 Environmental Protection Agency\uc2  to lift regulations on coal plants established under \uc2 Mr. Obama\uc2 , reimpose abortion restrictions at home and abroad, shift the focus of American foreign policy, start building a wall along the border with Mexico and bar entry to the United States from countries with a history of terrorism.\par \par \uc2 Some of \uc2 Mr. Obama\uc2 's closest advisers describe that as their worst nightmare.\par \par \uc2 ''I'm sure he thinks about that first 100 days the way the rest of us do,'' Dan Pfeiffer, the president's former senior adviser, said of \uc2 Mr. Obama\uc2 . ''You wake up every day, and another thing that you and your team worked so hard to do is undone. That would be more painful than the president or any of us can imagine.''\par \par \uc2 Jen Psaki, the president's communications director, added that ''there's been all of this work done, progress made.''\par \par \uc2 ''How does this continue?'' she asked. ''Who his successor is is a big part of that puzzle.''\par \par \uc2 Members of Mr. Bush's administration harbored some of the same fears eight years ago as the Republican president prepared to cede the White House to his successor.\par \par \uc2 ''It goes through the mind of any second-term president,'' said Peter Wehner, who served as the director of the Office of Strategic Initiatives for Mr. Bush. ''You shift at some point to trying to lock in things you've already done, to make sure they can't be undone and can't be reversed.''\par \par \uc2 Despite that effort, \uc2 Mr. Obama\uc2 's defeat of Senator \uc2 John McCain\uc2  of Arizona, the Republican candidate for president in 2008, meant the end of many national security policies put in place after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks.\par \par \uc2 The new president waited only two days to end the C.I.A.'s secret prisons, prohibit torture as part of interrogations and order the closing of the Guant\u225\'00\'E1namo prison -- which remains open seven and a half years later because of deep resistance from Congress.\par \par \uc2 Several months into his administration, \uc2 Mr. Obama\uc2  made public detailed memos from the Bush administration that described the brutal interrogation techniques, even as he rejected prosecutions for C.I.A. operatives who used the techniques on detainees.\par \par \uc2 By May of his first year in office, \uc2 Mr. Obama\uc2 's actions to reverse Bush-era national security policies prompted former Vice President Dick Cheney to deliver a searing condemnation of the new president and his team.\par \par \uc2 ''It is recklessness cloaked in righteousness, and would make the American people less safe,'' Mr. Cheney said in remarks he made at the same time that \uc2 Mr. Obama\uc2  delivered a national security speech across town in Washington.\par \par \uc2 ''Just remember,'' Mr. Cheney warned, ''it is a serious step to begin unraveling some of the very policies that have kept our people safe since 9/11.''\par \par \uc2 Now, it is \uc2 Mr. Obama\uc2  and his aides who are worried about the same kind of unraveling that so angered Mr. Cheney.\par \par \uc2 ''The \uc2 Obama\uc2  legacy has got some lasting and permanent features,'' said Gregory B. Craig, \uc2 Mr. Obama\uc2 's first White House counsel.\par \par \uc2 He added that if Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  wins the \uc2 election\uc2 , ''a lot of his most significant achievements will all be at risk in that first 100 days.''\par \par \uc2 Mr. Holder said some changes that came about during the Obama presidency would be tough for any president to roll back, even Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 . Even a Republican president, he said, would find it difficult to take health insurance away from the 20 million people who get it from the Affordable Care Act.\par \par \uc2 And political and legal gains by gay and lesbian Americans have been ratified by the Supreme Court and by public opinion, Mr. Holder noted. The next president would probably find it difficult to reimpose restrictions based on sexual orientation, he said.\par \par \uc2 ''That has become a part of the fabric of our nation in a whole variety of ways,'' Mr. Holder said. ''I don't think however determined a president might be, you could in essence turn the clock back on those measures.''\par \par \uc2 But he warned that similar legal and political protections do not exist for a host of other \uc2 Obama\uc2 -era policies, big and small. He said programs like the ones he championed at the Justice Department to overhaul sentencing guidelines could easily be changed by the next attorney general.\par \par \uc2 ''A substantial part of that progress would be at risk if \uc2 Trump\uc2  were to be elected,'' Mr. Holder said. ''I don't think there's any question.''\par \par \uc2 Find out what you need to know about the 2016 presidential race today, and get politics news updates via \uc2 Facebook\uc2 , \uc2 Twitter\uc2  and the First Draft newsletter.\par \par \uc2 President George W. Bush in 2008. After taking office, President Obama wasted little time overturning many practices Mr. Bush had put in place.

FRIEDMAN \par \uc2 947 \uc2 words\par \uc2 27 July 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 27\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Yes, we're having a national \uc2 election\uc2  right now. Yes, there are two parties running. But no, they are not the two parties that you think. It's not ''Democrats'' versus ''Republicans.'' This \uc2 election\uc2  is really between ''Wall People'' and ''Web People.''\par \par \uc2 The primary focus of Wall People is finding a president who will turn off the fan -- the violent winds of change that are now buffeting every family -- in their workplace, where machines are threatening white-collar and blue-collar jobs; in their neighborhoods, where so many more immigrants of different religions, races and cultures are moving in; and globally, where super-empowered angry people are now killing innocents with disturbing regularity. They want a wall to stop it all.\par \par \uc2 Wall People's desire to stop change may be unrealistic, but, in fairness, it's not just about race and class. It is also about a yearning for community -- about ''home'' in the deepest sense -- a feeling that the things that anchor us in the world and provide meaning are being swept away, and so they are looking for someone to stop that erosion.\par \par \uc2 Wall People have two candidates catering to them: \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2 , who boasts that he is ''The Man'' who can stop the winds with a wall, and Bernie Sanders, who promises to stop the winds by ending our big global trade deals and by taking down ''The Man'' -- the millionaires, billionaires and big banks. I don't see how the country could afford either man's plans, but they have a simple gut appeal, and there is overlap between them.\par \par \uc2 Web People instinctively understand that Democrats and Republicans both built their platforms largely in response to the Industrial Revolution, the New Deal and the Cold War, but that today, a 21st-century party needs to build its platform in response to the accelerations in technology, globalization and climate change, which are the forces transforming the workplace, geopolitics and the very planet.\par \par \uc2 As such, the instinct of Web People is to embrace the change in the pace of change and focus on empowering more people to be able to compete and collaborate in a world without walls. In particular, Web People understand that in times of rapid change, open systems are always more flexible, resilient and propulsive; they offer the chance to feel and respond first to change. So Web People favor more trade expansion, along the lines of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, and more managed immigration that attracts the most energetic and smartest minds, and more vehicles for lifelong learning.\par \par \uc2 Web People also understand that while we want to prevent another bout of recklessness on Wall Street, we don't want to choke off risk-taking, which is the engine of growth and entrepreneurship.\par \par \uc2 Because the G.O.P. was out of the White House for the last eight years, the party's base and leadership are the least understanding of the world in which we're living. That is why the G.O.P. fractured first and why some Republican Web People, particularly from the business world, are either sitting this \uc2 election\uc2  out or voting for \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Having been secretary of state, \uc2 Clinton\uc2  has been touching the world. She knows America has to build its future on a Web People's platform, which was first articulated by \uc2 Bill \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , and, to this day, is best articulated by him. But Hillary has not always shown the courage of her own, or her husband's, convictions.\par \par \uc2 So, rather than take on Wall People in her party -- and saying to Sanders, ''Socialism was the wrong answer for the industrial age, so it sure isn't the right answer for the information age'' -- she is tacking toward Wall People. She is opposing things she helped to negotiate, like the Pacific trade deal, and offering more benefits from government but refraining from telling people the hardest truth: that to be in the middle class, just working hard and playing by the rules doesn't cut it anymore. To have a lifelong job, you need to be a lifelong learner, constantly raising your game.\par \par \uc2 To her credit, though, she chose a great running mate, Senator Tim Kaine, a Web Person with a soul.\par \par \uc2 My hope is that, for the good of the country, Republican Web People will, over time, join the Democratic Party and tilt it into a compassionate, center-left Web party for the 21st century. That would be a party that is sensitive to the needs of working people, appreciative of the anchoring power of healthy communities, but committed to capitalism, free markets and open trade as the vital engines of growth for a modern society and to providing every American with the learning tools to realize their potential.\par \par \uc2 I don't see any chance of the G.O.P. becoming a center-right party again soon. The Tea Party, \uc2 Trump\uc2  and Fox News have made its base too angry and disconnected from reality.\par \par \uc2 So everything rides on the coalition that \uc2 Clinton\uc2  assembles. If America is to thrive in the 21st century, we desperately need a coalition that can govern smartly in this era of rapid change. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  has a chance to break not only the glass ceiling for women, but also the rigid walls that have divided our two parties. If she can pull that off, it will make being the first woman president the second most important thing she does.\par \par \uc2 I invite you to follow me on Twitter (@tomfriedman).\par \par \uc2 Follow The \uc2 New York Times\uc2  Opinion section on \uc2 Facebook\uc2  and Twitter (@NYTopinion), and sign up for the Opinion Today newsletter.\par \par \uc2 Document NYTF000020160727ec7r0004p\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 National Desk; SECTA\par \b \uc2 Top Indiana Republicans Choose Pence's Deputy to Run for Governor in His Place\b0\par\par\uc2 By MONICA DAVEY \par \uc2 610 \uc2 words\par \uc2 27 July 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 18\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 A committee of top Indiana Republicans picked a new candidate for governor on Tuesday, filling a sudden gap left when \uc2 Gov. Mike Pence\uc2  was tapped as \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's running mate.\par \par \uc2 Eric Holcomb\uc2 , the lieutenant governor, was chosen by the committee, 22 local and state Republican leaders who voted on the issue during a private meeting in Indianapolis.\par \par \uc2 The departure from the race of Mr. Pence, who was until this month seeking re-\uc2 election\uc2  this fall, had opened a frenzy of jockeying for his job in a state where Republicans control the capital. Four people sought to be picked, setting off a cascade of uncertainty and chaos about other races around the state. Some vying to be governor dropped out of other races only days ago, and those not selected say they will seek to return to the races they left.\par \par \uc2 The committee's selection, Mr. Holcomb, will in November face John Gregg, a Democrat, who lost a close race against Mr. Pence in 2012. Mr. Holcomb, appointed to that post by Mr. Pence this year, said in a news conference after Tuesday's announcement that he intended to campaign on an agenda that included economic and community development. ''We've got work to do,'' he said of the campaign ahead.\par \par \uc2 In recent days, Mr. Pence, who remains in office to finish his first term even as he campaigns on the Republican presidential ticket, endorsed Mr. Holcomb to replace him. Mr. Holcomb is a former state party chairman and was an adviser to former Gov. Mitch Daniels -- roles that gave him an upper hand in the odd, brief and intense campaign for the nomination, which required only the support of party leaders.\par \par \uc2 Also considered for the governor's slot was Representative Susan W. Brooks, who had received support from \uc2 Gov. Chris Christie\uc2  of New Jersey, a competitor of Mr. Pence as Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  chose his running mate. Representative Todd Rokita and State Senator Jim Tomes had also hoped to replace Mr. Pence on the November ballot.\par \par \uc2 Jeff Cardwell, the chairman of the Indiana Republican Party, declined to provide the vote tallies but said each candidate had been given a chance to give a three-minute speech and answer questions.\par \par \uc2 ''We are blessed to have such a deep bench of talent to pull from,'' he said in a statement after the meeting.\par \par \uc2 Neither Mr. Holcomb nor the possible replacements he beat out are as well known across Indiana as Mr. Pence, and any of them would have been starting at a disadvantage in campaign time and funds raised. But Mr. Pence's re-\uc2 election\uc2  had not been seen as a certainty; he had drawn intense criticism, including among some Republicans, for his handling last year of a law that could have allowed religious conservatives to deny services to same-sex couples.\par \par \uc2 Already, Democrats were casting Mr. Holcomb's bid as an extension of Mr. Pence's policies. ''\uc2 Eric Holcomb\uc2  is just another out-of-touch ideologue who will hurt the middle class and undermine Hoosier values,'' said \uc2 John Zody\uc2 , the chairman of the Indiana Democratic Party.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Gregg, who had continued campaigning without an opponent while Republicans rushed to find a replacement for Mr. Pence, was quick to link Mr. Holcomb to his former opponent. ''\uc2 Eric Holcomb\uc2  wholeheartedly embraced the failed approach that embarrassed our state, cost us jobs and has left the middle class behind,'' Mr. Gregg said.\par \par \uc2 With the nomination now decided, Republicans in Indiana have another task: finding a candidate to replace Mr. Holcomb as lieutenant governor.\par \par \uc2 Document NYTF000020160727ec7r00052\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 LETTER FROM AMERICA\par \uc2 National Desk; SECT\par \b \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  Is Hoping Her Steady Hand Will Be the Key\b0\par\par\uc2 By JOHN HARWOOD \par \uc2 711 \uc2 words\par \uc2 27 July 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 The New York Times on the Web\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 PHILADELPHIA -- On issues and ideology, the center of American politics has shrunk drastically. The vast majority of voters know which side they're on.\par \par \uc2 On temperament and character, however, the electorate isn't nearly as polarized. Many voters who diverge on party alignment agree broadly on threshold qualities they want in a president: steadiness, judgment, maturity, understanding, honesty.\par \par \uc2 It is in that personal center where \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  aims to defeat \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2  -- and where her new running mate, Tim Kaine, may be able to help.\par \par \uc2 Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  begins with a huge obstacle. The broad public regard she enjoyed in her nonpartisan role as secretary of state has melted in the heat of the campaign.\par \par \uc2 The furor over her email hurt. In this month's New York Times/CBS News poll, 67 percent of voters said they did not consider her honest.\par \par \uc2 Fortunately for Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , most voters feel the same way about Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 : A majority, 62 percent, don't trust the billionaire real estate developer and reality-television star.\par \par \uc2 The former first lady emphasizes other personal attributes. Denouncing him last month, Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  pointed to the need for a commander in chief to remain calm under pressure.\par \par \uc2 ''He's not just unprepared, he's temperamentally unfit to hold an office that requires knowledge, stability and immense responsibility,'' Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  said. ''This is not someone who should ever have the nuclear codes, because it's not hard to imagine \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  leading us into a war just because somebody got under his very thin skin.''\par \par \uc2 What made that attack notable in modern presidential politics was the absence of ideological content. She framed the contrast in personal terms, an argument underscored by the quiet, measured tone with which she sketched it.\par \par \uc2 Democratic strategists hope Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  can leverage that approach in the \uc2 election\uc2 's most critical battle. Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  aims to swell the Republican margin of victory among white voters without college educations (26 percentage points, according to 2012 exit polls), while Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  aims to shrink the Republican edge among white college graduates (14 percentage points in 2012).\par \par \uc2 ''The key demographic question is how much better can \uc2 Clinton\uc2  do among college-educated whites,'' said the Democratic pollster Geoff Garin, who advises a pro-\uc2 Clinton\uc2  ''super PAC.'' ''This question of temperament and seriousness is very important to those voters.''\par \par \uc2 Recent NBC News/Wall Street Journal surveys underscore her opportunity. Thirty-five percent of white college graduates said that only she had the right judgment to be president, compared with 25 percent for Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 . But 40 percent did not express a clear preference.\par \par \uc2 In a June survey, non-college-educated whites said, by a margin of 46 percent to 35 percent, that Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  would be better able to handle a crisis. College-educated whites gave Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  a 17-percentage-point edge -- but 19 percent expressed no clear preference between the candidates on this issue.\par \par \uc2 Republicans tailored their convention to Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's side of the educational divide. In his speech formally accepting the nomination, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  gave voice to the anger and fear felt most acutely by working-class whites amid economic and cultural change.\par \par \uc2 Democrats hope that those ''hot'' messages will repel better-educated whites in middle- and upper-middle-class suburbs. By choosing the genial Mr. Kaine as her running mate over liberal firebrands like Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  underscored the temperamental contrast.\par \par \uc2 ''If I'm good at anything in public life, it's because I started at the local level, listening to people and trying to find consensus,'' Mr. Kaine said at their kickoff appearance together.\par \par \uc2 Along the spectrum of presidential temperament and seriousness, Mr. Kaine's self-deprecating observation that ''I'm boring'' highlights an asset; so does his Catholic faith. He cast Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  similarly as a candidate who ''listens'' rather than ''insults people,'' as Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  does.\par \par \uc2 In theory, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's divergence from conservative orthodoxy on issues like trade and entitlement programs should let him reach for new voters across the ideological divide. Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  aims to do it along the spectrum that stretches not from right to left, but from hot to cool.\par \par \uc2 Document NYTF000020160727ec7r0005c\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 Dining In, Dining Out / Style Desk; SECTD\par \b \uc2 Putting Food Issues on Politicians' Plates\b0\par\par\uc2 By KIM SEVERSON \par \uc2 2,079 \uc2 words\par \uc2 27 July 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 1\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 CLEVELAND -- After a long day at the Republican National Convention, protesters, delegates and reporters shuffled past the entrance to Mabel's BBQ, Michael Symon's restaurant in the heart of downtown.\par \par \uc2 Inside, another celebrity chef was just getting started. Tom Colicchio, the politically focused New York culinary personality, picked up a microphone and began speaking to a crowd of about 100 people who seemed to be at the party as much for the free brisket and strawberry brambles as for the discussion.\par \par \uc2 One was Congressman Lamar Smith, the conservative from Texas. As Mr. Colicchio linked the plight of farmers to immigration, the environment, health care costs and the national security threat posed by overweight soldiers, Mr. Smith added another piece of smoked turkey breast to his plate and sneaked upstairs to eat.\par \par \uc2 He was followed by a reporter, who asked whether food issues were gaining traction among lawmakers, and whether the nation's food system may get any attention in the presidential \uc2 election\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 ''I'm going to disappoint you,'' he said. ''I don't know anything about that. The barbecue is good, though.''\par \par \uc2 Even though the cultural conversation around food and agriculture seems to grow louder every day, the American food system was on the sidelines here last week, as it is at the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia this week. Even among those most likely to push for it, food isn't getting much attention as a political issue.\par \par \uc2 ''What people think is cool about food and what people think is cool about politics are different,'' said Matt Birong, a Democratic delegate from Vermont who continues to support Senator Bernie Sanders.\par \par \uc2 He traveled to Philadelphia from Vergennes, where he runs the 3 Squares Caf\u233\'00\'E9. He supports local farmers and has opinions about federal subsidies. But how the nation grows, processes and distributes food is less important to him than labor issues and the economic challenges of running a small business.\par \par \uc2 ''For the national delegation, it might come up as a sidebar conversation for a few of us,'' he said, ''but as far as a functional initiative, it has never been approached.''\par \par \uc2 Granted, it would be especially difficult to wedge food issues into what is shaping up to be one of the wildest elections in recent memory. And terrorism, immigration, racism and gun control seem more pressing than school lunch.\par \par \uc2 Still, food could soon become a more lucrative piece of political currency, some politicians, pollsters and convention veterans say.\par \par \uc2 ''Is a person going to choose between \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  and \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  based on food issues? No,'' said Jerry Hagstom, an agricultural journalist who has been to every presidential convention since 1984. ''But politicians are getting into it from a policy standpoint in areas like health and food waste and food safety because it's becoming a big issue of concern to voters.''\par \par \uc2 Politically, the ubiquity of food is both a strength and a weakness. Food can be a hunger issue, an immigration issue, an animal welfare issue, a labor issue, an environmental issue, a farming issue, a health issue, a trade issue.\par \par \uc2 ''Terrorism is the only problem that is unrelated to this, but somehow in Washington, D.C., food and its connection to health and the economy has pretty much escaped the attention of everyone from Congress to Senate to the candidates for president,'' said Dariush Mozaffarian, the dean of the Tufts Friedman School of Nutrition Science and Policy, who has made the case that food is the nation's biggest economic issue.\par \par \uc2 People who think food needs to be higher on the national agenda should do a better job connecting the dots, said \uc2 Bob Kerrey\uc2 , the former governor and United States Democratic senator from Nebraska.\par \par \uc2 ''You need to start off by understanding that agriculture is primarily a manufacturing business and make food an economic issue, rather than labeling it as a health or environmental issue,'' he said. ''Then you have to walk across the gulf between that and the people who are actually buying the food.''\par \par \uc2 But to many voters, food is not that complicated. ''Politicians are intimidated by it, but voters aren't,'' said \uc2 Celinda Lake\uc2 , a Democratic pollster and political strategist. Last fall, she joined the Republican public opinion researcher Christine Matthews to study how food issues play out with voters. The bipartisan poll was commissioned by Food Policy Action, the HEAL Food Alliance and the \uc2 Union of Concerned Scientists\uc2 , the groups behind the barbecue party featuring Mr. Colicchio as part of the Plate of the Union campaign.\par \par \uc2 To draw attention to the cause, organizers recruited Larry Robinson, who sells rum cake and jambalaya out of his food truck in Miami. His truck, rebranded with the Plate of the Union logo, traveled to both conventions and will pop up in a dozen more cities before the \uc2 election\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 ''I'm not here for the politics,'' said Mr. Robinson, who has family members with diabetes. ''We need kids to get healthier food.''\par \par \uc2 The place where food and family intersect is ripe for developing a strong block of food voters, especially in swing states, pollsters said. The organic-milk mom could be the new bipartisan soccer mom. With \uc2 Walmart\uc2  selling organic produce, farmers' markets in nearly every community and \uc2 McDonald's\uc2  promoting a new less-is-more ingredient philosophy the line is growing faint between what were once considered latte-drinking liberals and red-state beer buyers.\par \par \uc2 ''To some degree, it really does blur party lines,'' said Rep. Thomas Massie, a libertarian-minded Republican from Kentucky who is popular with some members of the Tea Party and raises grass-fed cattle. ''It's a missed opportunity among politicians.''\par \par \uc2 Millennial voters are more articulate about food issues than any generation before, and less apt to be loyal to any one political party. And food is one of the few issues in which lawmakers from different parties can find common ground, Mr. Massie said.\par \par \uc2 Voters, conservative and liberal, are concerned about the environmental impact of certain industrial agricultural practices and understand the connection between food and health. Large-scale agribusiness and powerhouse farming organizations still hold great sway over agricultural policy, but ''the degree to which big ag lines politicians' pockets has reached the point where they can't be ignored,'' Mr. Massie said.\par \par \uc2 He points to the Food Freedom movement, which has gained bipartisan support in the quest to loosen federal raw-milk regulations and oversight of how livestock can be killed on small farms. Much of what's written on the Food Freedom USA website -- which also features an endorsement of Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  -- reads like a speech that could be delivered over dinner at Chez Panisse, including the right to G.M.O.-free, whole, raw, fresh unprocessed locally raised food.\par \par \uc2 Even some speakers at the Great American Farm Luncheon, a Republican convention tradition sponsored by the biggest players in farming and agribusiness, understand that the culture is shifting, said Mr. Hagstrom, the agricultural journalist, who covered the lunch for his news service, The Hagstrom Report, and who planned to attend a similar cocktail reception at the Democratic event.\par \par \uc2 Farmers and ranchers are frustrated with taxes and regulations that put what many consider unrealistic limits on labor, conservation practices and food labels. ''They feel beleaguered,'' Mr. Hagstrom said.\par \par \uc2 Many recognize that it's time to do a better job explaining their side of agriculture to urban consumers, college students and ''people who live in a loft,'' \uc2 David Daniels\uc2 , the director of the Ohio Agriculture Department, said at the lunch.\par \par \uc2 They may find more common ground than they think. Consider Michael Brinkley, a conservative North Carolina farmer who raises hogs and vegetables on what used to be tobacco land, and Emily Evans, a liberal \uc2 Ohio State University\uc2  senior who is studying sustainable community development.\par \par \uc2 He looks for someone who may help remove federal regulations that get in the way of raising the food he sells to farmers' markets. She looks for candidates who care about the exploitation of farmworkers and food inequality. But they both consider a candidate's position on food when they vote.\par \par \uc2 ''Food is not a red or blue issue,'' she said.\par \par \uc2 Recipe: Cowboy Cookies\par \par \uc2 This recipe came to The Times in 2000 during the Bush-Gore presidential campaign when Family Circle magazine ran cookie recipes from each of the candidates' wives and asked readers to vote. Laura Bush's cowboy cookies, a classic chocolate chip cookie that's been beefed up with oats, pecans, coconut and cinnamon, beat Tipper Gore's ginger snaps by a mile. Here is an adaptation of that winning recipe.\par \par \uc2 3 cups all-purpose flour\par \par \uc2 1 tablespoon baking powder\par \par \uc2 1 tablespoon baking soda\par \par \uc2 1 tablespoon ground cinnamon\par \par \uc2 1 teaspoon salt\par \par \uc2 1 1/2 cups (3 sticks) butter, at room temperature\par \par \uc2 1 1/2 cups granulated sugar\par \par \uc2 1 1/2 cups packed light-brown sugar\par \par \uc2 3 eggs\par \par \uc2 1 tablespoon vanilla\par \par \uc2 3 cups semisweet chocolate chips\par \par \uc2 3 cups old-fashioned rolled oats\par \par \uc2 2 cups usweetened flake coconut\par \par \uc2 2 cups chopped pecans (8 ounces)\par \par \uc2 1. Heat oven to 350 degrees.\par \par \uc2 2. Mix flour, baking powder, baking soda, cinnamon and salt in bowl.\par \par \uc2 3. In a very large bowl, beat butter with an electric mixer at medium speed until smooth and creamy. Gradually beat in sugars, and combine thoroughly.\par \par \uc2 4. Add eggs one at a time, beating after each. Beat in vanilla.\par \par \uc2 5. Stir in flour mixture until just combined. Stir in chocolate chips, oats, coconut and pecans.\par \par \uc2 6. For each cookie, drop 1/4 cup dough onto ungreased baking sheets, spacing 3 inches apart.\par \par \uc2 7. Bake for 15 to 17 minutes, until edges are lightly browned; rotate sheets halfway through. Remove cookies from rack to cool.\par \par \uc2 Yield: 3 to 3 1/2 dozen cookies\par \par \uc2 Adapted from Laura Bush\par \par \uc2 Recipe: Tipper Gore's Ginger Snaps\par \par \uc2 Contests pitting the baking ability of potential first ladies against each other began in 1992 when Hillary Rodham \uc2 Clinton\uc2  got everyone shaking and baking with her infamous cookie comment, discussing working as a lawyer while her husband was governor of Arkansas.\par \par \uc2 ''I suppose I could have stayed home and baked cookies and had teas,'' she said. Her remark created a reactionary cookie contest, the brainchild of Family Circle magazine, which published her chocolate chip recipe and one from Barbara Bush. In 2000, this recipe went up against Laura Bush's Cowboy Cookies.\par \par \uc2 ''I suppose I could have stayed home and baked cookies and had teas,'' she said.

Sanger reported from Washington, and Eric Schmitt from Colorado Springs. Amy Chozick contributed reporting from Philadelphia. \par \uc2 1,628 \uc2 words\par \uc2 27 July 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 1\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 WASHINGTON -- American intelligence agencies have told the White House they now have ''high confidence'' that the Russian government was behind the theft of emails and documents from the \uc2 Democratic National Committee\uc2 , according to federal officials who have been briefed on the evidence.\par \par \uc2 But intelligence officials have cautioned that they are uncertain whether the electronic break-in at the committee's computer systems was intended as fairly routine cyberespionage -- of the kind the United States also conducts around the world -- or as part of an effort to manipulate the 2016 presidential \uc2 election\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 The emails were released by \uc2 WikiLeaks\uc2 , whose founder, Julian Assange, has made it clear that he hoped to harm \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's chances of winning the presidency. It is unclear how the documents made their way to the group. But a large sampling was published before the \uc2 WikiLeaks\uc2  release by several news organizations and someone who called himself ''Guccifer 2.0,'' who investigators now believe was an agent of the G.R.U., Russia's military intelligence service.\par \par \uc2 The assessment by the intelligence community of Russian involvement in the D.N.C. hacking, which largely echoes the findings of private cybersecurity firms that have examined the electronic fingerprints left by the intruders, leaves President Obama and his national security aides with a difficult diplomatic and political decision: whether to publicly accuse the government of President \uc2 Vladimir V. Putin\uc2  of engineering the hacking.\par \par \uc2 Such a public accusation could result in a further deterioration of the already icy relationship between Washington and Moscow, at a moment when the administration is trying to reach an accord with Mr. Putin on a cease-fire in Syria and on other issues. It could also doom any effort to reach some kind of agreement about acceptable behavior in cyberspace, of the kind the United States has been discussing with China.\par \par \uc2 In an interview with Savannah Guthrie of NBC News on Tuesday, President Obama stopped short of accusing the Russian agencies from seeking to manipulate the \uc2 election\uc2  but said, ''Anything's possible.''\par \par \uc2 He noted that ''on a regular basis, they try to influence elections in Europe.''\par \par \uc2 Stealing information about another country's political infighting is hardly new, and the United States has conducted covert collection from allies like Germany and adversaries like Russia for decades. Publishing the documents -- what some have called ''weaponizing'' them -- is a different issue. Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's campaign has suggested that Mr. Putin was trying to even the score after the former secretary of state denounced a 2011 Russian \uc2 election\uc2  as filled with fraud.\par \par \uc2 ''The first thing that the secretary of state did was say that they were not honest and not fair, but she had not even yet received the material from the observers,'' Mr. Putin said at the time. ''She set the tone for some actors in our country and gave them a signal,'' Mr. Putin continued. ''They heard the signal and, with the support of the \uc2 U.S. State Department\uc2 , began active work.''\par \par \uc2 Campaign officials have also suggested that Mr. Putin could be trying to tilt the \uc2 election\uc2  to \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2 . But they acknowledge that they have no evidence.\par \par \uc2 Asked on Tuesday at the Democratic convention in Philadelphia whether ''there's more to the \uc2 Trump\uc2 /Russian relationship that hasn't come out,'' \uc2 John Podesta\uc2 , the \uc2 Clinton\uc2  campaign chairman, said, ''Well, he certainly has a bromance with Mr. Putin, so I don't know.''\par \par \uc2 Mr. Podesta said that while Russia had a ''history'' of interfering in democratic elections in Europe, it would be ''unprecedented in the United States.''\par \par \uc2 The Republican platform, adopted last week in Cleveland, calls on the United States to ''respond in kind and in greater magnitude'' to cyberattacks. ''Russia and China see cyber operations as part of a warfare strategy during peacetime,'' it says. ''Our response should be to cause diplomatic, financial and legal pain.''\par \par \uc2 But the \uc2 Trump\uc2  campaign has dismissed the accusations about Russia as a deliberate distraction, meant to draw attention away from the content of nearly 20,000 emails and documents from the Democratic committee that \uc2 WikiLeaks\uc2  started releasing on Friday. They showed efforts to impugn Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont in his effort to challenge Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  for the nomination.\par \par \uc2 On \uc2 Twitter\uc2  Tuesday night, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  said that in order to deflect ''the horror and stupidity of the Wikileakes disaster,'' Democrats were saying: ''Russia is dealing with \uc2 Trump\uc2 . Crazy!''\par \par \uc2 ''For the record,'' he said, ''I have ZERO investments in Russia.''\par \par \uc2 Mr. Obama, in his interview with NBC News, criticized Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  for suggesting last week that the United States should not defend from Russian aggression any country that does not contribute sufficient funds to \uc2 NATO\uc2 . He said Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  was ''undermining'' the country's post-World War II alliances in Europe.\par \par \uc2 Secretary of State John Kerry raised the cyberattack with his Russian counterpart, Sergey V. Lavrov, on Tuesday at a meeting of foreign ministers in Vientiane, Laos. Mr. Lavrov dismissed the idea that Russia was involved, telling reporters who asked about the charges: ''I don't want to use four-letter words.''\par \par \uc2 Mr. Kerry made no accusations, saying he had to allow the F.B.I. to ''do its work'' before he drew ''any conclusions in terms of what happened or who's behind it.''\par \par \uc2 The federal investigation, involving the F.B.I. and the intelligence agencies, has been going on since the Democratic National Committee first called in a private cybersecurity firm, Crowdstrike, in April.\par \par \uc2 Preliminary conclusions were discussed on Thursday at a weekly cyberintelligence meeting for senior officials. The Crowdstrike report, supported by several other firms that have examined the same bits of code and telltale ''metadata'' left on documents that were released before \uc2 WikiLeaks\uc2 ' publication of the larger trove, concludes that the Federal Security Service, known as the F.S.B., entered the committee's networks last summer.\par \par \uc2 The G.R.U., a competing, military intelligence unit, was a later arrival. Investigators believe it is the G.R.U. that has played a bigger role in releasing the emails.\par \par \uc2 In an essay published on Lawfare, a blog that often deals with cyberissues, Susan Hennessey, previously a lawyer for the National Security Agency, called the published evidence about Russian involvement ''about as close to a smoking gun as can be expected when a sophisticated nation-state is involved.''\par \par \uc2 Mr. Assange's threat to release documents, she wrote, ''means, put simply, that actors outside the U.S. are using criminal means to influence the outcome of a US \uc2 election\uc2 . That's a problem.''\par \par \uc2 But American intelligence agencies have their doubts that the Russian intention, at least initially, was to sway the American \uc2 election\uc2 . The intrusion began just shortly after Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  announced his candidacy for the Republican nomination. At the time, his chances looked minuscule. One senior official noted that while the cyberattack might have been intended to embarrass Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , who was the presumptive nominee, it could not have been aimed at bolstering Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 It is far from clear that Mr. Obama or the F.B.I. director, James B. Comey, would ever name Russia as the origin of the hack. Mr. Obama has only once accused a country of attacking an American organization, when he said North Korea was the source of the 2014 attack against \uc2 Sony Pictures Entertainment\uc2 . But the United States has no relationship with North Korea, and there was little to lose from identifying it.\par \par \uc2 In the case of Russia and China -- countries with which the United States has complex relationships -- Mr. Obama has in the past made the opposite decision. He never named the Russian intelligence agencies as the perpetrators of hacks on the State Department and White House unclassified email systems, or on the Joint Chiefs of Staff.\par \par \uc2 While the administration has called out the People's Liberation Army of China for stealing intellectual property, -- even indicting officers of its now-inactive Unit 61398 -- it never publicly accused the Chinese intelligence services of stealing the security-clearance files on more than 21 million Americans who held or applied for clearances.\par \par \uc2 By happenstance, the intelligence report on the \uc2 Democratic National Committee\uc2  hacking was circulating here the day that Mr. Obama issued a new policy, long in development, to organize the government's response to major cyberattacks and to set up a six-point ''grading system'' to assess the severity of strikes against American companies, government agencies and organizations.\par \par \uc2 The action against the Democratic committee, they said, would qualify as a ''significant cyber incident,'' which was defined as one that causes ''demonstrable harm to the national security interests, foreign relations or economy of the United States, or to the public confidence, civil liberties or public health and safety of the American people.''\par \par \uc2 Ranking the hacking in the pantheon of other penetrated networks is difficult. The top ranking under Mr. Obama's system would be reserved for an attack that disabled American power grids, for example, akin to the suspected Russian attack on Ukraine's electrical system in December. The attack on the Office of Personnel Management and \uc2 Sony\uc2 , which destroyed 70 percent of the studio's computers, would also rank above the ''category 3'' level, which defines a ''significant'' attack.\par \par \uc2 But the ranking system does not mandate what kind of response the president would authorize. And it was designed before many in Washington imagined the use of cyberattacks to release information in the midst of a dizzying, and volatile, presidential campaign.\par \par \uc2 Secretary of State John Kerry and the Russian foreign minister, Sergey V.

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 PHILADELPHIA -- Follow along with our coverage of the Democratic National Convention.\par \par \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's campaign is dismissing questions about the white supremacist David Duke, after the former Ku Klux Klan leader said on his radio program that the Republican presidential nominee left open the possibility of supporting his Senate campaign.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Duke said on Monday that Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  did ''as much as he could'' in a weekend interview to suggest that he could back Mr. Duke, who is seeking a Louisiana Senate seat.\par \par \uc2 Asked about Mr. Duke's remarks, Hope Hicks, a spokeswoman for Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , emailed, ''Again, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  has disavowed David Duke and will continue to do so.''\par \par \uc2 She went on: ''If you want to continue to waste our time with these questions, we will happily address them and allocate our resources for real stories pertaining to Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's candidacy for president of the United States and his message to the American people elsewhere.''\par \par \uc2 The radio program remarks were reported by the website \uc2 BuzzFeed\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 On Tuesday afternoon, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , in an email sent by a spokesman, issued his most forceful rebuke of Mr. Duke to date: ''As we have many times in the past, we disavow David Duke. There's no place for this in the Republican Party.''\par \par \uc2 Questions about Mr. Duke have dogged Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  for months, after he was slow to disavow him in a \uc2 CNN\uc2  interview during the South Carolina primary when Mr. Duke spoke admiringly of the candidate's message. Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  later said, ''I disavow,'' and he criticized Mr. Duke's suggestion that he had conquered ''Jewish supremacists'' within the Republican Party.\par \par \uc2 In his own campaign announcement in recent days, Mr. Duke said that Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  was championing issues that he had raised for decades.\par \par \uc2 When Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  was asked Sunday on NBC's ''Meet the Press'' if he would support a Democrat over Mr. Duke in the general \uc2 election\uc2 , he replied: ''I guess depending on who the Democrat is, but the answer would be yes. Look, the answer is as quick as you can say it -- in fact, I want to answer you before you -- because last time with another person in your position, I did it very quickly and they said he didn't do it fast enough. Rebuked.''\par \par \uc2 On his radio program on Monday, Mr. Duke said that Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  was asked, '''Would you vote for a Democrat against David Duke' and \uc2 Trump\uc2  says, 'Well, I guess it depends who the Democrat will be so the answer is yes.'''\par \par \uc2 He added: ''You know, like maybe if there's a good Democrat. But that's not the answer they wanted and the headlines there were all over the place. You know, \uc2 Trump\uc2  basically said he could possibly vote, he could vote for David Duke if he was running against a liberal Democrat. So he did something. I think he felt like he did as much as he could do.''\par \par \uc2 Find out what you need to know about the 2016 presidential race today, and get politics news updates via \uc2 Facebook\uc2 , \uc2 Twitter\uc2  and the First Draft newsletter.\par \par \uc2 Document NYTF000020160727ec7r0004i\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 National Desk; SECTA\par \b \uc2 Democratic Email Release Was Timed for Convention\b0\par\par\uc2 By CHARLIE SAVAGE \par \uc2 882 \uc2 words\par \uc2 27 July 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 17\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 WASHINGTON -- Six weeks before the anti-secrecy organization \uc2 WikiLeaks\uc2  published an archive of hacked \uc2 Democratic National Committee\uc2  emails ahead of the Democratic convention, the organization's founder, Julian Assange, foreshadowed the release -- and made it clear that he hoped to harm \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's chances of winning the presidency.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Assange's remarks in a June 12 interview underscored that for all the drama of the discord that the disclosures have sown among supporters of Bernie Sanders -- and of the unproven speculation that the Russian government provided the hacked data to \uc2 WikiLeaks\uc2  in order to help \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2  -- the disclosures are also the latest chapter in the long-running tale of Mr. Assange's battles with the Obama administration.\par \par \uc2 In the interview, Mr. Assange told a British television host, Robert Peston of the \uc2 ITV\uc2  network, that his organization had obtained ''emails related to \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  which are pending publication,'' which he pronounced ''great.'' He also suggested that he not only opposed her candidacy on policy grounds, but also saw her as a personal foe.\par \par \uc2 At one point, Mr. Peston said: ''Plainly, what you are saying, what you are publishing, hurts \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 . Would you prefer \uc2 Trump\uc2  to be president?''\par \par \uc2 Mr. Assange replied that what Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  would do as president was ''completely unpredictable.'' By contrast, he thought it was predictable that Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  would wield power in two ways he found problematic.\par \par \uc2 First, citing his ''personal perspective,'' Mr. Assange accused Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  of having been among those pushing to indict him after \uc2 WikiLeaks\uc2  disseminated a quarter of a million diplomatic cables during her tenure as secretary of state.\par \par \uc2 ''We do see her as a bit of a problem for freedom of the press more generally,'' Mr. Assange said.\par \par \uc2 (The cables, along with archives of military documents, were leaked by Pvt. Chelsea Manning, then known as Bradley Manning, who is serving a 35-year prison sentence. \uc2 WikiLeaks\uc2  also provided the documents to news outlets, including The \uc2 New York Times\uc2 . Despite a criminal investigation into Mr. Assange, he has not been charged; the status of that investigation is murky.)\par \par \uc2 In addition, Mr. Assange criticized Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  for pushing to intervene in Libya in 2011 when Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi was cracking down on Arab Spring protesters; he said that the result of the \uc2 NATO\uc2  air war was Libya's collapse into anarchy, enabling the Islamic State to flourish.\par \par \uc2 ''She has a long history of being a liberal war hawk, and we presume she is going to proceed'' with that approach if elected president, he said.\par \par \uc2 In February, Mr. Assange said in an essay that a vote for Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  to become president amounted to ''a vote for endless, stupid war.''\par \par \uc2 Efforts to reach Mr. Assange for comment were unsuccessful, and a \uc2 Clinton\uc2  campaign spokesman did not respond to an inquiry. In November 2010, when \uc2 WikiLeaks\uc2  and its news media partners began publishing the cables, Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  strongly condemned it.\par \par \uc2 ''In addition to endangering particular individuals, disclosures like these tear at the fabric of the proper function of responsible government,'' she said then.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Assange's remarks last month received only scattered attention, in part because in the interview Mr. Peston appeared to mistakenly assume that \uc2 WikiLeaks\uc2  had obtained still-undisclosed emails from the private server Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  had used while secretary of state and kept cutting Mr. Assange off to ask about it.\par \par \uc2 But it now seems clearer that Mr. Assange was trying to talk about the \uc2 Democratic National Committee\uc2  emails.\par \par \uc2 (The confusion stemmed in part because Mr. Assange said in the interview that \uc2 WikiLeaks\uc2  had ''published'' her State Department emails. But it made a copy of the ones the department posted on its website and made them easier to search.)\par \par \uc2 Mr. Assange spoke from the Ecuadorean Embassy in London, where he has been holed up for four years. Sweden is seeking his extradition for an investigation into sexual misconduct allegations; his supporters have expressed fear that if he is arrested, he could be sent to the United States and prosecuted for publishing leaked documents.\par \par \uc2 After the Democratic chairwoman, Representative \uc2 Debbie Wasserman Schultz\uc2 , resigned Monday when Sanders supporters reacted angrily to revelations in the emails that party officials had privately rooted for Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  to win the presidential nomination, Mr. Assange told the news program ''Democracy Now!'' that he had timed their release to coincide with the Democratic convention.\par \par \uc2 ''Often it's the case that we have to do a lot of exploration and marketing of the material we publish ourselves to get a big political impact for it,'' he said. ''But in this case, we knew, because of the pending D.N.C., because of the degree of interest in the U.S. \uc2 election\uc2 , we didn't need to establish partnerships with The \uc2 New York Times\uc2  or The \uc2 Washington Post\uc2 .''\par \par \uc2 Asked on that program whether the Russian government had given him the emails, Mr. Assange said that he never revealed sources but also that ''no one knows who our source is.'' He also said the \uc2 Democratic National Committee\uc2  might have been hacked on multiple occasions by different intruders.\par \par \uc2 The WikiLeaks founder, Julian Assange, suggested that he saw Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  as a personal foe.

And I'm going to tell the polls that you are feeble and I have to help you into the booth."\par \par \uc2 "We as women should be so proud that there is a strong and viable candidate," said Ms. Stewart, a \uc2 Clinton\uc2  supporter.\par \par \uc2 At its convention in Philadelphia this week, the \uc2 Democratic National Committee\uc2  is playing up the historic nature of Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  becoming the first female presidential nominee.\par \par \uc2 -- Janet Adamy\par \par \uc2 ---\par \par \uc2 PHILADELPHIA\par \par \uc2 Protester Count\par \par \uc2 Below Estimates\par \par \uc2 Police estimated Tuesday that 5,500 total people participated in more than a dozen demonstrations across the city on the opening day of the Democratic convention.\par \par \uc2 The Monday figures marked a large increase from the protests at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland, where even the largest demonstrations only drew a couple of hundred people. But it's a far cry from the 35,000 to 50,000 that Philadelphia city officials initially expected.\par \par \uc2 The small but spirited demonstrations were mostly in support of presidential candidate Bernie Sanders. The protests were largely peaceful, but police said 54 people were detained on Monday and given civil citations for disorderly conduct, for allegedly attempting to scale a fence around the convention site.\par \par \uc2 -- Byron Tau\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=wjco20160727000155"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document J000000020160727ec7r0004r\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw272\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4080\pichgoal600

\par\par \b \uc2 The Democratic Convention: \uc2 Clinton\uc2  Opposes Trade Vote This Year\b0\par\par\uc2 By Laura Meckler   \par \uc2 424 \uc2 words\par \uc2 27 July 2016\par \uc2 The Wall Street Journal\par \uc2 J\par A6\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 PHILADELPHIA -- The chairman of \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's presidential campaign said Tuesday she opposes a congressional vote on a pending Pacific free-trade agreement later this year and said she wouldn't seek to simply tweak the language if she became president.\par \par \uc2 John Podesta\uc2  said Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  and her newly minted running mate, Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia, have been clear about the Trans-Pacific Partnership, or TPP.\par \par \uc2 "They're against it before the \uc2 election\uc2  and against it after the \uc2 election\uc2 ," he said at a Wall Street Journal lunch. He said he met with House Democrats, who overwhelmingly oppose the pact, on Monday and reiterated that position. "So they know, they well know what our position is."\par \par \uc2 Before he was picked as running mate, however, Mr. Kaine had said there was much about the trade bill that he liked. And he was among senators who voted for a trade promotion authority measure that helped the Obama administration to complete negotiations on the TPP.\par \par \uc2 Asked if Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  would seek to renegotiate the agreement but keep the overall structure, he said no. "We're not about renegotiation," he said. "We're interested in a new approach."\par \par \uc2 Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  has supported some trade pacts in the past, including the \uc2 North American Free Trade Agreement\uc2 , or Nafta, which her husband signed, and she previously called the TPP the "gold standard" while she was secretary of state and it was being negotiated.\par \par \uc2 After the deal was completed last year, she came out against it, saying it didn't assure American wages would rise, among other concerns.\par \par \uc2 Still, some Democrats who are deeply opposed to free-trade deals have worried that once elected she will get behind the trade agreement, which is strongly supported by President \uc2 Barack Obama\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Mr. Obama is still hoping for congressional approval during his term, potentially during a "lame duck" session late this year, after the \uc2 election\uc2 . Opponents are pressuring Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  to clearly oppose that strategy.\par \par \uc2 On Monday, at the Democratic National Convention, delegates on the floor waved anti-TPP signs, and some chanted "no TPP!" Her general \uc2 election\uc2  opponent, Republican \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2 , is also a strong opponent of the pact.\par \par \uc2 Asked whether Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  would seek to block a lame-duck vote, Mr. Podesta, a former Obama adviser, said: "What the president chooses to do, whether he thinks that that's an effective strategy, is up to him, but that is not our strategy."\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=wjco20160727000154"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document J000000020160727ec7r0004q\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw272\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4080\pichgoal600

\par\par \b \uc2 The Democratic Convention: \uc2 Obama\uc2  to Play Central Role\b0\par\par\uc2 By Carol E. Lee   \par \uc2 663 \uc2 words\par \uc2 27 July 2016\par \uc2 The Wall Street Journal\par \uc2 J\par A6\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 PHILADELPHIA -- President \uc2 Barack Obama\uc2  has one final campaign to run, and with his address Wednesday at the Democratic National Convention he'll face an improbable challenge: convince his supporters who are ambivalent about \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  to vote for her in November.\par \par \uc2 Eight years after defeating Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  in a hard-fought primary, the fates of these two historic candidates -- the first black president and the first female nominee from a major party -- are now closely linked.\par \par \uc2 His legacy on a host of issues -- from health care and climate change to the Iran nuclear deal -- hinges on her victory and commitment to maintain the course he has set.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Obama knows well the risks when a new president of the opposite party comes into the White House because he spent much of his initial weeks in office reversing policies his predecessor, George W. Bush, had put into effect.\par \par \uc2 "We went through this phase in 2009 when every day we woke up and undid something George Bush had done, and that was our message of the day," said Dan Pfeiffer, who was a top aide to Mr. Obama at the time.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Obama will deliver Wednesday's address 12 years to the day of his speech before the 2004 Democratic convention that transformed him into a political star. The final convention speech of his political career is designed to pass the baton to his potential successor, former cabinet member and onetime rival.\par \par \uc2 Republicans have long anticipated the \uc2 Obama\uc2 -\uc2 Clinton\uc2  team effort, and they hope to turn it to their advantage.\par \par \uc2 "The fact President \uc2 Obama\uc2 's legacy so heavily depends on whether another Democrat succeeds him shows what a weak and divisive president he has been," said Michael Short, a spokesman for the Republican National Committee.\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 Clinton\uc2  campaign gave Mr. Obama unusual placement in the convention lineup. A sitting president typically speaks opening night, as President \uc2 Bill \uc2 Clinton\uc2  did for Al Gore in 2000. President George W. Bush, deeply unpopular during his final year in office, didn't attend the 2012 Republican convention.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Obama, however, will play a central role in Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's convention and broader campaign. It helps that his job approval rating has been above 50% for three consecutive months, according to the Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll.\par \par \uc2 Anita Dunn, one of Mr. Obama's former communications directors, said the president's prominent role at the convention "speaks to his political strength" as well as how Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  represents a continuation of many of his policies.\par \par \uc2 White House officials said Mr. Obama plans to focus partly on drawing a contrast with Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , including an emphasis on the importance of diversity, but mostly make a case for why Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  is the best candidate to succeed him. As part of that effort, he'll outline for Democrats what policies he believes would be threatened if she is defeated, officials said.\par \par \uc2 "He's supporting \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  because he thinks she's the right person to succeed him," said White House communications director Jen Psaki. "But there's also no question that as he looks at the progress that's been made and there is a clear difference between what passing the baton to \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  would mean versus what passing the baton to the alternative would mean."\par \par \uc2 In the initial days and weeks after the convention, Mr. Obama, at the request of the \uc2 Clinton\uc2  campaign, will focus on fundraising, officials said. By October, the president is expected to be on the campaign trail regularly to energize key Democratic constituencies. The \uc2 Clinton\uc2  campaign, in particular, hopes he can help convert independent voters.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Obama has played surrogate for many Democrats since taking office in 2009. But his coalition of voters, particularly young people and minorities, has not turned out in full force in any \uc2 election\uc2  where he wasn't on the ballot.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=wjco20160727000153"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document J000000020160727ec7r0004p\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw272\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4080\pichgoal600

\par\par \b \uc2 De Blasio\uc2  Seeks a National Reboot --- New York City's mayor is looking to bolster his progressive profile after several public missteps\b0\par\par\uc2 By Josh Dawsey   \par \uc2 898 \uc2 words\par \uc2 27 July 2016\par \uc2 The Wall Street Journal\par \uc2 J\par A15\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 PHILADELPHIA -- New York City Mayor \uc2 Bill de Blasio\uc2  has struggled during the past year as he has sought to position himself as a national leader in the left wing of the Democratic Party and influence the 2016 presidential \uc2 election\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 His presidential forum fizzled. His nonprofit to advance a liberal national agenda now has no staff or programming. His delayed endorsement of \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  was widely criticized. And he lost his bid to bring the Democratic convention to Brooklyn.\par \par \uc2 This week, as the mayor zigzags his way to speaking engagements and midnight parties in Philadelphia, the site of the Democratic National Convention, Mr. de Blasio is attempting to find his footing after a year of setbacks on the national stage.\par \par \uc2 But his Wednesday address at the convention -- scheduled for 4:30 p.m., hours before predecessor \uc2 Michael Bloomberg\uc2  -- highlights his struggle to build a national profile and carve out his own niche among more well-known progressive leaders and New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, leader of the state's delegation.\par \par \uc2 "His profile hasn't really come up here," said U.S. Rep. Charles Rangel, who is considered the dean of the New York congressional delegation. "I don't really know why. Maybe it's because the governor is here."\par \par \uc2 Mr. de Blasio, 55 years old, has visited more than 10 events, from trashing \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  at a late-night Italian dinner to bemoaning the struggles that cities face in convincing state governments to pass laws that help them at an immigration forum.\par \par \uc2 The mayor met privately on Tuesday with U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's primary rival. Mr. de Blasio praised Mr. Sanders's dramatic influence on the race, a mayoral aide said.\par \par \uc2 When Mr. de Blasio appeared at a \uc2 Working Families Party\uc2  event Tuesday, he was widely cheered, drawing the biggest applause on a panel that included a New Jersey union official, a fourth-grade teacher, a New York City councilman and Katrina vanden Heuvel, publisher of the Nation.\par \par \uc2 "I am just glad I lived this long to be here at this moment, to be here at this convention, to see this platform for our party," Mr. de Blasio said at the Working Families forum, which drew about 150 people.\par \par \uc2 In his convention speech Wednesday, Mr. de Blasio plans to draw sharp distinctions between Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  and Republican nominee \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  from the perspective of a New Yorker who knows both well, an aide said.\par \par \uc2 While Mr. de Blasio's schedule has been busy, Mr. Cuomo appeared to be dominating the spotlight. The men have frequently quarreled.\par \par \uc2 At a breakfast Tuesday with New York's delegation, Mr. Cuomo was feted by Mr. Sanders and praised by House Democratic leader U.S. Rep. Nancy Pelosi of California for "leading the nation" on liberal policies.\par \par \uc2 Mr. de Blasio was mentioned twice and received lukewarm applause, but he didn't attend. The state's U.S. senators, Democrats \uc2 Charles Schumer\uc2  and Kirsten Gillibrand, attended with about a dozen House members and prominent labor leaders.\par \par \uc2 Members of the state's delegation were chattering that Mr. Bloomberg had a better speaking spot at the convention.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Bloomberg, who won his three bids for City Hall as the Republican nominee and is now unaffiliated with any party, isn't personally close with Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 . Mr. de Blasio managed Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's successful campaign for \uc2 U.S. Senate\uc2  in New York in 2000 and worked in former President Bill \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's administration.\par \par \uc2 To be sure, Mr. de Blasio has many fans in Philadelphia. As he outlined several of his accomplishments at the \uc2 Working Families Party\uc2  forum, including universal prekindergarten and affordable housing, he received applause. In New York, political observers have noted Mr. Cuomo has increasingly passed a number of liberal policies, and some attribute that to Mr. de Blasio's prodding.\par \par \uc2 Last year, Mr. Cuomo and many prominent state Democrats immediately endorsed Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  on the day she launched her presidential campaign. Mr. de Blasio delayed his endorsement for six months, sparking criticism as he repeatedly said he wanted to first hear her views on progressive issues.\par \par \uc2 The mayor tried to stage a presidential forum in Iowa last fall but ended up canceling it when no candidates agreed to attend. This year, he traveled to Iowa to campaign for Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , but she didn't campaign with him and he was left door-knocking in the snow.\par \par \uc2 In the past few months, Mr. de Blasio has appeared to turn away from national efforts and focus on his 2017 re-\uc2 election\uc2  campaign.\par \par \uc2 "I think he is looking inward and focusing more on the city," said U.S. Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, a Democrat who represents a swath of Brooklyn and Queens. "That's a good thing. I give him credit for that."\par \par \uc2 Connecticut Gov. Dannel Malloy, one of a number of Democrats who joined the mayor at Gracie Mansion last year to unveil a progressive version of the Republicans' 1990s-era Contract with America, said he himself hasn't focused on that agenda lately.\par \par \uc2 "Platforms come and go, issues rise and fall," Mr. Malloy said. "I think right now what we're all focused on is electing \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 ."\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=wjco20160727000120"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document J000000020160727ec7r0003s\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw272\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4080\pichgoal600

\par\par \b \uc2 U.S. News: Jobless Picture Is Open to Interpretation --- Political campaigns clash over different ways of measuring unemployment\b0\par\par\uc2 By Josh Zumbrun   \par \uc2 629 \uc2 words\par \uc2 27 July 2016\par \uc2 The Wall Street Journal\par \uc2 J\par A2\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 Because political campaigns can rise and fall on the health of the economy, spats often flare over the gauges used to measure growth and unemployment.\par \par \uc2 The latest dust-up, raised by the campaign of Republican presidential nominee \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2 , focuses on the monthly employment numbers. A long streak of hiring has nudged the jobless rate down to 4.9%.\par \par \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  Jr., the nominee's son, recently criticized the official statistics as "artificial numbers . . . massaged to make the existing economy look good."\par \par \uc2 The nominee himself has said unemployment is far higher than the Labor Department's headline 4.9% rate would suggest, part of his message that the economy is in a dire state. After he won the New Hampshire primary in February, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  called the official jobless figures "phony" and said the real number could be as high as 42%.\par \par \uc2 This isn't the first time people have cast aspersions on the jobs numbers in an \uc2 election\uc2  year, but the \uc2 Trump\uc2  claim is also part of a larger discussion over how best to assess the health of the labor market.\par \par \uc2 The Labor Department's monthly statistics, which date to 1948, have always defined unemployment as the state of being without a job while actively looking for work. The definition, unchanged for decades, was designed to exclude people who didn't want jobs, like pensioners or students. But Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  Jr. suggested the longstanding method is flawed since it excludes some people who want jobs but aren't looking. His father has made this case, too.\par \par \uc2 "The way we actually measure unemployment is after X number of months if someone can't find a job, congratulations, they're miraculously" not counted as unemployed, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  Jr. said.\par \par \uc2 This isn't quite right, but it's close. The headline unemployment rate includes anyone actively searching for work, even if they haven't worked in years. People it doesn't include are those who want jobs but become so discouraged or marginally attached to the labor market they stop looking.\par \par \uc2 The Labor Department doesn't ignore them, but nor does it count them as "employed." Beginning in 1994, the department has provided monthly estimates of the unemployment rate if you include discouraged workers. It also produces an estimate including people who work part-time but would prefer full-time work.\par \par \uc2 If you include all these, you get a higher rate: 9.6% underemployment in June, according to the Labor Department.\par \par \uc2 There is longstanding debate about the best measure to focus on. One economist who often highlights the broader gauge of underemployment is Federal Reserve Chairwoman \uc2 Janet Yellen\uc2 , who mentions it as justification for the Fed's strategy of raising interest rates slowly.\par \par \uc2 Accusations of fudging the numbers crop up from time to time. During the 2012 \uc2 election\uc2 , former General Electric CEO \uc2 Jack Welch\uc2  accused President \uc2 Barack Obama\uc2 's campaign of manipulating the numbers to help defeat Republican \uc2 Mitt Romney\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Mr. Welch's claim never won much support, and Mr. Romney didn't echo the claim. Independent measures of unemployment, such as from Gallup surveys, find similar numbers as the official stats.\par \par \uc2 Despite his criticism, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  has sometimes opted for the traditional narrower measure of joblessness. Last week, for example, he touted the record of his running mate, Indiana Gov. Mike Pence.\par \par \uc2 "Indiana's unemployment rate -- this is the primary reason I wanted Mike," Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  said, noting Indiana's jobless rate had fallen below 5%.\par \par \uc2 That is true, but only by the traditional definition of unemployment. The broader gauge of underemployment was 8.8% over the past year in Indiana.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=wjco20160727000080"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document J000000020160727ec7r0002o\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw272\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4080\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 You haven't seen \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2 's tax returns, but you've seen the \uc2 Democratic National Committee\uc2 's emails. There may be a connection: Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  is not as rich and independent as he says, and his business empire has partly been financed in recent decades by Russian interests that perhaps now favor his rise to the White House.\par \par \uc2 No, that doesn't make Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  the "Siberian candidate." If he were, he would disguise the fact. His campaign manager wouldn't be a longtime adviser to \uc2 Vladimir Putin\uc2 's recently deposed pet Ukrainian strongman. His foreign-policy adviser wouldn't be a \uc2 Gazprom\uc2  intimate. His staff wouldn't conspicuously have rewritten the GOP platform in a way that pleases Moscow on Ukraine. Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  Jr. wouldn't have bragged in a 2008 promotion to investors that "Russians make up a pretty disproportionate cross-section of a lot of our assets."\par \par \uc2 The truth is, Mr. Putin is as much or more an "asset" to Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  as the other way round. It pays Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  to be associated with the world's flashiest tough guy. Plenty of Americans want the same in their leader.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  is a classic demagogue. He has made his way by breast-beating about American dilemmas as if he discovered them. We won't enforce our immigration law but won't change it either. \uc2 NATO\uc2 's role is uncertain and America shoulders a disproportionate burden. Trade raises our standard of living but costs some Americans their jobs (as all competition does). This editorial page has warned for 30 years about too big to fail. If it were as easy to solve these dilemmas as Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  pretends, they would have been solved by now.\par \par \uc2 Put aside the practical arguments prominent Republicans use for, grudgingly, supporting Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 : His tax plan is good. He would blow up a status quo incapable of productive change or evolution. He's not \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 The problem is, these supporters who lend him credibility nevertheless can't believe anything Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  says. He lies not only to voters in the time-honored way, to gather a coalition to get him into office. He has a history of lying in his business, to his partners, customers, lenders and subcontractors. He sent his wife out to tell the American people "your word is your bond." She stole the line from \uc2 Michelle Obama\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  may occasionally tell the truth but you would never know it. His supporters are only guessing about what he intends, if anything, in office.\par \par \uc2 The hell of our situation, of course, is that his opponent is \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 . What was originally intriguing about her email server was the option she created for herself -- the option to delete inconvenient official emails so they would never become public property or recoverable by investigators.\par \par \uc2 An option is valuable even if you never exercise it. To this day, we don't know why the late \uc2 Clinton\uc2  administration official Sandy Berger stole and destroyed three versions of a \uc2 Clinton\uc2  terrorism memo while returning two other versions to the National Archives.\par \par \uc2 Investigators learned enough to elicit Berger's guilty plea, but they never established motive. They never established whether he was acting on another's behalf. They never established whether he stole and destroyed other documents, though it was his behavior on previous visits that aroused the suspicions of Archive employees.\par \par \uc2 Somehow Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  and her entourage will be skipping out on even this modicum of justice. Never mind that, with deliberation and foresight, after deciding which emails to turn over, she and her lawyers made sure that their servers and devices were wiped clean to "preclude complete forensic recovery," in the words of FBI chief James Comey.\par \par \uc2 That may have seemed convenient to Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  at the time but creates a giant risk for voters. A complete record may yet exist that Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  doesn't know about. Hackers may have broken into her server -- Mr. Comey seemed to suggest it was highly likely. Before or after she takes the oath, foreign agencies may begin posting unredacted versions of the censored emails the State Department has been publishing. They may post nonpersonal "personal" emails the State Department has never seen. They may post fake "deleted" emails that Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  would be unable to prove are fake.\par \par \uc2 Tell me again, which presidential candidate has given Mr. Putin unprecedented sway over a U.S. presidential contest?\par \par \uc2 It may not be the crime of the century, but a picture remains of Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  sweeping in and doing whatever she wanted, with nobody in the Obama administration having the courage to raise an objection or explaining why it was incompatible with law and national interest.\par \par \uc2 Which A) sounds a lot like how Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  might behave in the White House. And which B) makes it all the more puzzling why the \uc2 Clinton\uc2  email scandal isn't also an Obama scandal.\par \par \uc2 One thing is sure: Whoever wins in November, Americans will be looking to Congress's checks and balances, and to the rule of law, to protect them from a chief executive whose fidelity to law they have every reason to distrust.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=wjco20160727000069"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document J000000020160727ec7r0002d\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw272\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4080\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 REVIEW & OUTLOOK (Editorial)\par \b \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's Trade Opportunism\b0\par\par\uc2 793 \uc2 words\par \uc2 27 July 2016\par \uc2 The Wall Street Journal\par \uc2 J\par A12\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 Opposition to free trade is fueling the protests at the Democratic convention this week, and Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren elevated protectionism nearly to an official Philadelphia theme on Monday. By Thursday the spectacle may include \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , though her trade pandering is treacherous politics and undermines her claim to be the superior statesman to \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 The cause of open trade is at a low ebb amid the rise of the Sanders-Warren progressives and the \uc2 Trump\uc2  tariff right, plus a lack of leadership in Washington. The latest trade liberalizer to recant is Tim Kaine, who said as recently as last Thursday that the Pacific Rim trade deal is "a significant improvement over the status quo," only to declare his opposition after becoming Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's running mate.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  is now assailing Mr. Kaine for Herbert Hoover-come-lately hypocrisy, and he has a point. As Secretary of State, Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  helped negotiate the yet-to-be-ratified Trans-Pacific Partnership and gave some 45 public speeches for TPP. Then to fend off the Sanders challenge, she renounced the final TPP text in October 2015, and getting tough on China, outsourcing and other specters became stump staples. By opposing TPP, she's running against the last major initiative of a President of her own party, and the Philadelphia Democrats don't seem to mind.\par \par \uc2 More remarkable is that no one takes her statements at face value. Her left-right critics think she's setting up a trade double cross, while corporate CEOs assure us that she is merely making a tactical TPP feint and after the \uc2 election\uc2  she'll push it through Congress.\par \par \uc2 This perception of trade insincerity does match the \uc2 Clinton\uc2  record. In the 1990s her husband promoted the \uc2 North American Free Trade Agreement\uc2  and most-favored nation status for China, and she endorsed both in her 2003 memoir "Living History."\par \par \uc2 In the 2007-2008 Democratic primaries, Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  said she would renegotiate the "mistake" that was Nafta, promised to defeat a pending deal with Colombia, and told an \uc2 AFL-CIO\uc2  town hall that a U.S.-South Korea pact would "put American jobs at risk." At Foggy Bottom, she then lobbied Congress to pass the Colombia and Korea agreements, and she deleted her Nafta do-over faster than the emails on her private server.\par \par \uc2 The Democrat is now bowing deeper than ever to protectionist forces. After Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  gave an America First speech in June, the \uc2 Clinton\uc2  campaign responded in a press release that his rhetoric was "reckless" and his "incoherent approach" would "throw our economy into a recession." Except for those minor details, the campaign added that he was stealing "Hillary's best ideas," which "seem to have moved straight from \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's policy fact sheets to his teleprompter."\par \par \uc2 So is the inner Hillary now a junior-achievement Donald? Who knows? Maybe this time she really has rolled left along with the Democratic Party and she means what she says, in which case she enjoys no particular pro-trade or pro-growth advantage over Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 But if Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  is merely triangulating again, then please spare us the lectures about "recklessness." Other than pacifying the Warren-Sanders wing, Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's new posture gains her little or no 2016 advantage. She can't outbid Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  on protectionism, one of the few policy matters that has sustained his attention since the 1980s, and his subtlety-free TPP opposition has already locked down most single-issue voters.\par \par \uc2 Meanwhile, Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  is damaging prospects for the 12-nation Pacific deal, if only by validating the claims of its opponents. This will make it harder for her to pass it if she is elected, especially if she lacks the will to face down the anti-trade caucus she is now indulging.\par \par \uc2 Assuming Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  still believes as she used to claim that TPP is critical for U.S. competitiveness and to balance China's growing influence in the Asia-Pacific, she is undercutting its already dire chances in Congress. She is also knee-capping Japanese Prime Minister \uc2 Shinzo Abe\uc2 , who has made TPP central to his economic reform agenda.\par \par \uc2 Nearly seven of 10 voters tell pollsters they think Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  is untrustworthy, and the reason is no more mysterious than her political character. She'll say or do anything to get elected, even if means "evolving" from pro-trade first lady to anti-trade presidential candidate to pro-trade Secretary of State to anti-trade candidate back to allegedly pro-trade President.\par \par \uc2 Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's cheerleaders says she's the responsible candidate who knows better, but the evidence for this is awfully thin.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=wjco20160727000057"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document J000000020160727ec7r00021\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw272\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4080\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 THE 2016 RACE\par \uc2 National Desk; SECTA\par \b \uc2 The One Demographic That \uc2 Clinton\uc2  Can't Seem to Win Over\b0\par\par\uc2 By NATE COHN \par \uc2 1,120 \uc2 words\par \uc2 26 July 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 11\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 The list of voting groups generally alienated by \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2  is long: Hispanics, women, the young, the college educated and more. How is it that he's in such a close race with \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 ?\par \par \uc2 The answer lies with a group that still represented nearly half of all voters in 2012: white voters without a college degree, and particularly white men without a degree.\par \par \uc2 Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  is showing enormous weakness with this group. And these voters are supporting Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  in larger numbers than they supported \uc2 Mitt Romney\uc2  four years ago. It's enough to keep the \uc2 election\uc2  close. It could even be enough for him to win.\par \par \uc2 In six polls conducted this month, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  leads among white registered voters without a degree by a margin of 58 percent to 30 percent. This has been true, to varying degrees, for the entire year. It's a significant improvement over Mr. Romney in 2012, who led in pre-\uc2 election\uc2  polls by a 55-to-37 margin among this group.\par \par \uc2 In some new polls that are showing Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  with an overall lead, he has even larger leads among white working-class voters. A Monday \uc2 CNN\uc2  poll, for instance, had him ahead by three percentage points nationwide with a 66-to-29 edge among this group. The last live interview poll to show Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  ahead before the convention, an ABC/Washington Post poll, showed Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  with a 65-to-29 lead among the group. Conversely, Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  leads when she holds down her losses among these voters.\par \par \uc2 These voters tend to be men. According to our estimates, Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  is doing better among basically every group of voters except for white men without a degree.\par \par \uc2 The notion that Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  could remain competitive through gains among one group may counter expectations. The prevailing story line of recent elections held that Democrats overcame weakness among white working-class voters with sweeping demographic shifts to a more diverse electorate. This framework implied that white working-class voters had been reduced to just a fraction of the electorate, and that the Republicans had little room for gains among them.\par \par \uc2 But white working-class voters represented about 44 percent of 2012 voters, and President Obama was not especially weak among them. Across the North, he ran even with, or ahead of, \uc2 John Kerry\uc2  in 2004 and Al Gore in 2000 with that group. In raw numbers, there were more white-working class voters who supported Mr. Obama than nonwhite voters or college-educated white voters.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  has adopted a message all but perfectly devised to attract these voters. He has a populist message on trade and immigration. He has abandoned key elements of the Republican agenda that hurt the party among white working-class Democrats, like support for cutting the social safety net.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  may also be benefiting from gender. Analysts have tended to treat the ''gender gap'' as if it always helps Democrats; Democrats are usually said to have an advantage among women, not a disadvantage among men. In truth, there's no way to distinguish between the two. Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's big drop-off among less-educated white men at least raises the possibility that she faces a significant gender penalty among this group.\par \par \uc2 It is also possible that less-educated white men are reacting to rapid changes in cultural and economic status, completely independent of Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's gender. No liberal arts college class on ''power, privilege and hierarchy'' will tell you that white working-class men have become a disadvantaged group.\par \par \uc2 But many white working-class men do not feel privileged -- not in a society where power and status are often vested in well-educated elites along the coasts. From their standpoint, the Democratic Party might look like an identity politics patronage system -- affirmative action, immigration, ''political correctness,'' gender or whatever else.\par \par \uc2 Regardless of the exact sources of Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's strength, his narrow but deep appeal has the potential to shake up the electoral map. The extent that Democrats are dependent on white working-class voters varies considerably by state. So, too, does the extent to which Republicans depend on college-educated white voters.\par \par \uc2 A result could be growing strength for Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  in the Midwestern states with many working-class Democrats, like Iowa or Ohio. Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , meanwhile, could excel in the states where there are fewer less-educated white voters for her to lose, and plenty of well-educated white voters or Hispanics for her to gain, like Virginia, Colorado, North Carolina and Florida. More traditionally Democratic states, like Pennsylvania and Iowa, might be in jeopardy.\par \par \uc2 These patterns are only beginning to emerge in the sparse public data. But the \uc2 Clinton\uc2  campaign's view is clearer. Joel Benenson, the campaign's pollster, said on Monday that Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  was ''stronger in the Sun Belt states'' than Mr. Obama was in 2012.\par \par \uc2 On the same day, the campaign pulled its advertisements in Colorado on the belief that it had built a large and durable lead -- an astonishing turn for a state where Democrats never reached 50 percent of the vote between 1964 and 2004. Yet last week, the \uc2 Clinton\uc2  campaign began airing advertisements in Pennsylvania -- a state where Democrats have won an above-average share of the vote in every \uc2 election\uc2  since 1952.\par \par \uc2 In the end, Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  could win enough well-educated white voters and nonwhite voters to swamp Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's white working-class gains. It's also possible that she could narrow Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's edge among white working-class voters, perhaps as soon as the Democratic convention.\par \par \uc2 But conservative populist messages are succeeding in the bastions of the old industrial-era left across the West, whether with pro-Brexit voters in northern England, or in Austria, where right-wing populists won areas carried by Social Democrats a decade earlier. Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  had similar strength in the white working-class South, Appalachia and the industrial East in the Republican primary. He could have it again.\par \par \uc2 The Upshot provides news, analysis and graphics about politics, policy and everyday life. Follow us on \uc2 Facebook\uc2  and \uc2 Twitter\uc2 .

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 PHILADELPHIA -- Democratic Party leaders scrambled on Monday night to rescue their convention from political bedlam as supporters of Senator Bernie Sanders erupted in boos, jeers and protests against \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  after an email leak showed that party officials had sought to undermine Mr. Sanders in their race for the nomination.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Sanders, whose speech was shifted to a more prominent time in hopes of soothing delegates, struggled to unify the convention. His full-throated endorsement of Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  drew scattered boos, and his valedictory tone left some supporters in tears rather than rallying around the Democratic nominee. Another speaker, \uc2 Michelle Obama\uc2 , was far more electrifying, but while she drew affection from the crowd, her remarks did little to heal the lingering primary wounds.\par \par \uc2 The venting among Sanders supporters reflected months of pent-up frustration after he lost the nomination to Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , whom they see as too accommodating to big business and Republicans. Mr. Sanders tried to intervene by sending a text message asking delegates ''to not engage in any kind of protest on the floor,'' while \uc2 Clinton\uc2  and Sanders campaign officials worked on the convention floor to mollify delegates who might be disruptive.\par \par \uc2 The tension reverberated from the floor of the hall to the stage. By 9:30 p.m., the outbursts were so loud and persistent that the comedian Sarah Silverman scolded the Sanders supporters who were shouting over her remarks.\par \par \uc2 ''Can I just say to the Bernie-or-bust people,'' she said, adopting their own nickname, ''you are being ridiculous.''\par \par \uc2 As delegates streamed out, a handful of Mr. Sanders's most dedicated supporters held up his signs and chanted, ''Hey, hey, D.N.C., we won't vote for Hillary.''\par \par \uc2 Clinton\uc2  campaign officials, in another bid to placate the party's left wing, picked Senator Elizabeth Warren to deliver the keynote address on Monday night, hoping that her searing denunciations of \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , the Republican nominee, would unify the delegates in the hall. Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  had privately chosen Ms. Warren days ago, campaign officials said, but announced her on Monday morning to try to set a positive tone for the first day of the convention and start closing ranks against Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Mr. Sanders, who took the stage here at about 10:50 p.m. to a thundering three-minute ovation and chants of ''Bernie, Bernie,'' acknowledged the disappointment of his supporters and said, ''It is no secret that \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  and I disagree on a number of issues.''\par \par \uc2 But he said the choice between his onetime rival and Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  was ''not even close.'' ''\uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  will make an outstanding president, and I am proud to stand with her here tonight,'' Mr. Sanders said as his supporters waved his blue campaign signs.\par \par \uc2 Ms. Warren opened her remarks with a warm nod to Mr. Sanders, saying his campaign had advanced liberal causes and helped show that the political and economic systems were ''rigged'' in favor of the powerful.\par \par \uc2 ''Bernie reminds us what Democrats fight for every day,'' Ms. Warren said. 'Thank you, Bernie.''\par \par \uc2 Yet even after Ms. Warren was well into her remarks, a handful of determined supporters of Mr. Sanders tried to interrupt her. ''We trusted you!'' they yelled, suggesting that she had betrayed them by supporting Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 These catcalls, as well as the images of delegates in Sanders T-shirts waving placards that read ''Hill No,'' were not the sort of messages that the \uc2 Clinton\uc2  campaign wanted. Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , who had a hand in choosing the speakers, had hoped that the convention would be the picture of unity, in contrast to the Republican convention last week. Instead, she was reminded that many Americans, including some die-hard Democrats, do not like her or believe that she will bring significant change to the government.\par \par \uc2 The only speaker who brought the entire hall together in spellbinding fashion was \uc2 Michelle Obama\uc2 , who seemed to pour out feelings she had been keeping under wraps. She delivered an unusually pointed speech targeting Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  without mentioning him by name.\par \par \uc2 ''The issues the president faces are not black and white, and cannot be boiled down to 140 characters,'' she said, taking a crowd-pleasing shot at Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's penchant for \uc2 Twitter\uc2  messages.\par \par \uc2 She alluded to those who have questioned Mr. Obama's ''citizenship or faith'' and scorned Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's slogan. ''Don't let anyone tell you that this country isn't great,'' she said. But she also turned emotional, her voice cracking, when she spoke of what Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's \uc2 election\uc2  would mean.\par \par \uc2 ''My daughters, and all our sons and daughters, now take for granted that a woman can be president of the United States,'' she said.\par \par \uc2 Throughout the day, more than 1,000 supporters of Mr. Sanders took to the scalding streets of Philadelphia to vent their frustration. Some targeted Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  with a taunting chant from last week's Republican convention: ''Lock her up!'' Other protesters gathered outside the downtown \uc2 Ritz-Carlton\uc2 , where many major donors to Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's campaign were staying, and attacked her use of a ''super PAC'' and her reliance on big fund-raising events.\par \par \uc2 Even Mr. Sanders, who has vowed to do whatever it takes to stop Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  from winning, had little luck making the case to his followers that they should vote for Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 . In a rare display of rebellion at a lunchtime gathering of his delegates, he was drowned out by boos when he mentioned Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , and seemed jarred by the response.\par \par \uc2 ''We have got to defeat \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2 , and we have got to elect \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  and Tim Kaine,'' he said to a round of jeers.\par \par \uc2 Several veterans of Democratic conventions said they had not seen anything at recent gatherings like Monday's disruptions. From the moment the gavel fell to open the convention at the Wells Fargo Center on Monday afternoon, Mr. Sanders's supporters let out boos and jeers at almost any mention of Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's name.\par \par \uc2 Some Democratic officials said the fury was an illustration of the work that still needed to be done to unify the party behind Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , as well as a sign of the dedication Mr. Sanders engendered over the last year.\par \par \uc2 The Sanders supporters' scorn was enough to prompt some of the speakers to gently scold them.\par \par \uc2 ''They both deserve our cheers,'' said former Mayor \uc2 Wellington E. Webb\uc2  of Denver, repeating the phrase twice more to make his point to the crowd.\par \par \uc2 But the liberal anger in the hall was not only due to the belief among Mr. Sanders's supporters that the party establishment had treated him unfairly. It was also driven by policy disagreements, underscoring the rifts between progressive activists and some Democratic leaders.\par \par \uc2 When Representative Elijah E. Cummings of Maryland, one of the most prominent black Democrats in Congress and a close ally of Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's, recounted his father's history as a sharecropper, he was nearly drowned out at times. Sign-waving progressives chanted in opposition to the Trans-Pacific Partnership, the trade accord that President Obama supports but Mr. Sanders and Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  oppose.\par \par \uc2 Sanders supporters directed their fury most intensely at Representative \uc2 Debbie Wasserman Schultz\uc2  of Florida, the departing Democratic National Committee chairwoman, as she spoke to Florida delegates on Monday morning. Hopes that Ms. Wasserman Schultz's decision on Sunday afternoon to resign would calm nerves were dashed as she publicly addressed her delegation at breakfast. Among those who believed for months that she was rigging the nominating fight, nothing would be forgiven so quickly.\par \par \uc2 They booed and screamed ''fair elections'' as Ms. Wasserman Schultz took the lectern and said: ''It is so wonderful to be able to be here with my home state. All right, everybody, now, settle down. Everybody settle down, please.''\par \par \uc2 They refused.\par \par \uc2 And as the convention was called to order Monday afternoon, resentments bubbled to the surface. Some delegates booed every mention of Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , while others waved Hillary buttons and chanted, ''Hill-a-ry!''\par \par \uc2 The number of protesters in Philadelphia was strikingly larger than in Cleveland, where Republicans gathered for their convention last week. By around 5 p.m., roughly 30 people had climbed over a barrier outside the Wells Fargo Center and been arrested.\par \par \uc2 The protesters reached the arena after marching at least three miles from City Hall in temperatures that reached into the mid-90s. Pressing anti-\uc2 Clinton\uc2  signs up against a temporary fence, they shouted at arriving delegates and erupted in cheers when the occasional Sanders delegate passed through.\par \par \uc2 Chants of ''Bernie beats \uc2 Trump\uc2 '' and ''hell no, D.N.C., we won't vote for Hillary,'' echoed through the surrounding parking lots.\par \par \uc2 ''She's crooked as all get out,'' said Brianne Colling, of Canton, Mich. ''All the proof that's coming out is that she's stolen this \uc2 election\uc2  from Bernie.''\par \par \uc2 Find out what you need to know about the 2016 presidential race today, and get politics news updates via \uc2 Facebook\uc2 , \uc2 Twitter\uc2  and the First Draft newsletter.\par \par \uc2 Bernie Sanders spoke at the convention Monday night, having been moved to a more prominent slot to soothe defiant supporters.

\par\par \uc2 National Desk; SECTA\par \b \uc2 A Roster Full of A-Listers, and Too Little Time to Showcase Them All\b0\par\par\uc2 By PATRICK HEALY \par \uc2 1,286 \uc2 words\par \uc2 26 July 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 13\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 PHILADELPHIA -- At a normal convention, organizers would happily give a coveted speaking role to a popular vice president like \uc2 Joseph R. Biden Jr\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 But this year the Democrats find themselves with too many party leaders (\uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , Senator Tim Kaine, President Obama, \uc2 Bill \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , Mr. Biden) and political stars (including Senator Bernie Sanders, Senator Elizabeth Warren and \uc2 Michelle Obama\uc2 ) and not enough prime slots in the 10-to-11 p.m. window over the convention's four nights, when the networks join cable channels in live coverage.\par \par \uc2 This cup-runneth-over challenge stands in sharp contrast to the glass-half-empty problem last week at the Republican convention, which had relatively few A-list speakers because so many prominent party leaders objected to \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2 . Republicans scrambled to put together a roster and revealed it at the last minute, while Democratic officials announced theirs early, among them naming Mr. Obama and Mr. Biden as headliners for Wednesday night.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Kaine is now widely expected to speak that night as well. Will all three men share a single hour? Will Mr. Kaine speak on another night, or will Mr. Biden be squeezed out? Convention organizers and \uc2 Clinton\uc2  campaign officials said details would be announced soon, leaving it to other Democrats to explain that an abundance of riches is not always easy to manage.\par \par \uc2 ''It's like admissions at a really good college: There are 10 applicants for every one slot, so the \uc2 Clinton\uc2  campaign has to make hard choices,'' said former Gov. Howard Dean of Vermont, who helped organize the Democratic convention in 2008. ''What you'll see this week are the leaders that Hillary wants you to see, because the program is really up to her.''\par \par \uc2 The egos on parade here this week will require some fierce wrangling. All of the speakers will be reminded of their strict time limits, and \uc2 Clinton\uc2  campaign advisers said they expected several drafts of speeches to arrive past their deadlines, since the degree of last-minute tinkering tends to be proportional to the importance of the speakers. And no matter how much control convention organizers exert, they cannot always stop big personalities from saying what they want, as Senator Ted Cruz of Texas did when he refused to endorse Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  at the Republican convention and encouraged delegates to ''vote your conscience.''\par \par \uc2 ''The biggest problem the Democrats face is the number of speakers who they have to put in prime time -- big egos demanding the best times,'' said Russell Schriefer, a senior Republican adviser to \uc2 Mitt Romney\uc2  in 2012 and to Gov. Chris Christie's campaign this year. ''And with \uc2 Bill \uc2 Clinton\uc2  and \uc2 Joe Biden\uc2  in particular, it is hard to dictate either content or the length of speeches, presenting potential message and scheduling nightmares.''\par \par \uc2 Clinton\uc2  advisers said they were confident that Mr. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  and Mr. Biden would deliver two of the best speeches of the convention, though they conceded that fitting all their A-list speakers into the 10 p.m. hour would be a challenge. Democrats on Monday named Ms. Warren as the keynote speaker for that evening, and they have to make time for heavy hitters who want to take whacks at Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , including former Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg of New York and the House minority leader, \uc2 Nancy Pelosi\uc2 . And Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  wants the 10 p.m. hours to include Americans who can speak to her priorities, like children of immigrants and mothers who have lost children to gun and police violence.\par \par \uc2 ''It's an unusual amount of big names to fit in, but what this convention shows is that \uc2 Clinton\uc2  has powerful people like Biden and \uc2 Cory Booker\uc2  and Elizabeth Warren and Sanders to deploy on the campaign trail,'' said Joe Trippi, a veteran adviser on Democratic campaigns. ''She could literally park Biden in Pennsylvania to campaign for her for a month, and do the same with Kaine in Florida, and she'd do so well she could forget about President Obama or \uc2 Bill \uc2 Clinton\uc2 .''\par \par \uc2 John Sasso, a veteran hand at Democratic conventions, said the two nominees on the tickets, as well as sitting presidents and former presidents, are virtually always guaranteed prime speaking slots. In 2004, when Mr. Sasso was a senior adviser to the Democratic nominee, \uc2 John Kerry\uc2 , the first night of the convention featured former Presidents \uc2 Clinton\uc2  and \uc2 Jimmy Carter\uc2 ; Al Gore, the former vice president and 2000 nominee; and Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , then a senator from New York. Mr. Sasso and other planners ended up giving the prime spots to the Clintons; their remarks dominated the news coverage, while Mr. Gore gave a far briefer speech but had one of the most memorable lines of the convention.\par \par \uc2 ''I had hoped to be back here this week under different circumstances, running for re-\uc2 election\uc2 ,'' Mr. Gore said. ''But you know the old saying: You win some, you lose some. And then there's that little-known third category.''\par \par \uc2 Mr. Sasso said it could be challenging to predict the best speakers and the duds. At the Republican convention, Tiffany \uc2 Trump\uc2  delivered a well-regarded speech, but did not make the cut for the 10 p.m. hour.\par \par \uc2 ''The Democrats have a better chance at getting attention because their speaking slots are logical,'' Mr. Sasso said. ''No one is going to cut away from Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, let alone cut off \uc2 Bill \uc2 Clinton\uc2  or President Obama.''\par \par \uc2 In Cleveland, by contrast, the broadcast and cable networks routinely cut away from the speakers, in part because their remarks were often unfocused. Several speakers glossed over Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's policy ideas, leadership qualities and business record; some barely mentioned him. Mr. Cruz, of course, pointedly snubbed him. Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  had to rely mostly on his wife, children and employees to say nice things about him and his delegates on the floor to cheer him on and boo Mr. Cruz off the stage.\par \par \uc2 For the most part, Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  will have the entire Democratic establishment ready to validate her or attack Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  -- few, if any, speakers are expected to raise questions about Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's candidacy.\par \par \uc2 Danny Diaz, who was Jeb Bush's campaign manager during the 2016 Republican nominating race, said Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  simply did not engender the same loathing within her party as Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  does. Leaders in both parties have reservations about their respective nominees, he said, but the Republican ambivalence and opposition was clearer at their convention because both elder statesmen and rising stars chose to stay away.\par \par \uc2 ''Because Democrats historically have a deeper reservoir of personas, particularly from popular culture, in part due to their liberal stances on social issues, it's likely their convention will be less impacted than the G.O.P.'s,'' Mr. Diaz said.\par \par \uc2 For the most part, Democrats said, more people wanted to talk about Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  than the convention knew what to do with.\par \par \uc2 ''I think there's pretty wide agreement that she's the most qualified person who has ever run,'' Mr. Dean said, ''and a lot of people want to talk about that.''\par \par \uc2 Find out what you need to know about the 2016 presidential race today, and get politics news updates via \uc2 Facebook\uc2 , \uc2 Twitter\uc2  and the First Draft newsletter.\par \par \uc2 Among the convention speakers are, clockwise from top left, former Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg of New York; Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.; Representative Nancy Pelosi, the minority leader; and former President Bill \uc2 Clinton\uc2 .

\par\par \uc2 Politics; SECT\par \b \uc2 Democratic Convention Day 1 Takeaways: \uc2 Michelle Obama\uc2  Steals the Show\b0\par\par\uc2 By ALEXANDER BURNS \par \uc2 786 \uc2 words\par \uc2 26 July 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 The New York Times on the Web\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 PHILADELPHIA -- The Democratic National Convention began with the ouster of the party's chairwoman, protests in the streets, disruptions on the convention floor and a torrential thunderstorm. Facing the prospect of chaos, an array of party leaders -- including \uc2 Michelle Obama\uc2 , and Senators Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren -- moved to heal the breach in the party, seemingly with some success. Our takeaways:\par \par \uc2 It's \uc2 Michelle Obama\uc2 's party\par \par \uc2 It's \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's convention, and it was Mr. Sanders's big night. But the unquestioned star of the program on Monday was Mrs. Obama, who used her prime-time speech to describe an optimistic, confident view of American social progress, and to embrace Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  as the natural heir to the Obama presidency.\par \par \uc2 She praised Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  as a big-hearted public servant and as a political survivor, and rebuked \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2  as a bully without mentioning his name. Most important, Mrs. Obama wrapped her speech in a sunny narrative about what the country has accomplished during her husband's presidency, celebrating the image of a black family in the White House and casting Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's \uc2 election\uc2  as a similar milestone.\par \par \uc2 ''Don't let anyone ever tell you that this country isn't great,'' Mrs. Obama said. ''This, right now, is the greatest country on earth.''\par \par \uc2 It was a strikingly positive speech in a bitter \uc2 election\uc2  season, and a vivid rendition of the political worldview that lifted the Obamas to the top of the party in the first place. The powerful response Mrs. Obama drew from the crowd showed just how formidable she is likely to be on the campaign trail.\par \par \uc2 The elected left embraces \uc2 Clinton\par \par \uc2 Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  needed a bear hug from liberal Democrats on Monday night to have any chance of easing tensions with supporters of Mr. Sanders, who entered the convention in a state of rage over the \uc2 Democratic National Committee\uc2 's meddling role in the 2016 primaries.\par \par \uc2 And a bear hug is what Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  got, most crucially from Mr. Sanders and Ms. Warren. In a speech that celebrated his own victories at length, Mr. Sanders also gave Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  his full-throated backing. ''\uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 ,'' he said, ''must become the next president of the United States.''\par \par \uc2 Ms. Warren delivered a string of sharp attacks on Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , while praising Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's liberal agenda and urging Democrats to ''work our hearts out to make \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  the next president.'' Representative Keith Ellison, Democrat of Minnesota, reminisced about Sanders rallies in his state, and said it was time to join forces with Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Still, those testimonials are unlikely to placate the most agitated demonstrators in the streets of Philadelphia. The question now is how many of Mr. Sanders's supporters are equally implacable.\par \par \uc2 Democrats have a protester problem\par \par \uc2 At first, the program appeared headed for disaster, as pro-Sanders activists shouted angrily at even liberal Democrats like Representative Elijah E. Cummings of Maryland and Senator Jeff Merkley of Oregon. The party barely averted an evening of unsightly clashes. By the start of the prime-time hours the rowdy heckling had largely abated -- but not entirely.\par \par \uc2 Senator \uc2 Cory Booker\uc2  of New Jersey, the Senate's only black Democrat, was interrupted by chants of ''Black lives matter.'' Some attendees taunted Ms. Warren, too, calling out, ''We trusted you!'' -- a reproach for supporting Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 It's not clear how big a chunk of Mr. Sanders's coalition these disruptive voices represent. But their willingness to keep jeering at the party's top leaders promises to keep cramping the proceedings as the week goes on.\par \par \uc2 Trump\uc2  plays a supporting role\par \par \uc2 The unifying theme at the Republican convention last week was fierce opposition to Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 . Her name was a rallying cry starting on the first night, as a jumbled collection of speakers railed against familiar offenses: her use of a private email server, her handling of the Benghazi, Libya, attack and more.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  has not yet taken such a central place in the Democratic convention. He was the target of attacks from a number of speakers, especially Ms. Warren, but anti-\uc2 Trump\uc2  riffs from other speakers were not surefire crowd pleasers, and the mere utterance of his name did not seem to electrify the audience.\par \par \uc2 That may change as the week progresses, and the focus of the convention shifts from achieving party unity to winning the general \uc2 election\uc2 . But on Monday, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  was often relegated to his least favorite place: the background.\par \par \uc2 Find out what you need to know about the 2016 presidential race today, and get politics news updates via \uc2 Facebook\uc2 , \uc2 Twitter\uc2  and the First Draft newsletter.\par \par \uc2 Document NYTF000020160726ec7q00074\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Bill \uc2 Clinton\uc2  is scheduled to speak Tuesday evening at the Democratic National Convention, where he'll presumably make a case for his wife, and for his own barrier-breaking role as first gentleman.\par \par \uc2 If \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  is elected president, the most important difference between \uc2 Bill \uc2 Clinton\uc2  and the presidential spouses who came before him won't just be that he is a man, and a former president. It will be something else entirely: his admitted and well-documented flaws. In a letter to Betty Ford, then the first lady, a Texas woman wrote, without a trace of humor, ''You are constitutionally required to be perfect.''\par \par \uc2 It would be laughable for anyone to expect that of the 42nd president. In fact, \uc2 Bill \uc2 Clinton\uc2  will be liberated from the fundamental, suffocating burden of first wifehood precisely because we know him so well, and most of us, like it or not, have come to accept his glaring imperfections.\par \par \uc2 No wife with Mr. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's history of philandering would ever be accepted as first lady. Imagine the frenzy if Melania \uc2 Trump\uc2  had a documented past of marital infidelity or if Laura Bush or \uc2 Michelle Obama\uc2  had cheated on their husbands while they were in the White House. The very idea of a first lady with a past as checkered as Mr. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's is incomprehensible. Betty Ford's divorce was controversial enough.\par \par \uc2 We expect the president's wife to be a devoted spouse and mother and nothing short of the embodiment of American womanhood. Lady Bird Johnson summed up these impossible expectations best when she said Americans wanted their first lady to be a ''showman and a salesman, a clotheshorse and a publicity sounding board, with a good heart, and a real interest in the folks.''\par \par \uc2 The reason Mr. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  would be exempt from such impossibly high standards is partly that he is who he is, but it is also that he is a man. He exists outside of all norms: His gender and his membership in the elite fraternity of ex-presidents (he is one of only four former presidents alive) are inextricable. ''A male spouse who wasn't a former president would have been a way to tiptoe into this uncharted territory,'' said Gahl Hodges Burt, social secretary under Ronald Reagan, ''instead of blasting our way into it.''\par \par \uc2 The role will shift to accommodate Mr. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , both as a man but perhaps more important as a former president. There is little doubt that Mr. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  will be involved in policy and have an important role to play while he is in the White House. Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  has said she will give him the heavy assignment of ''revitalizing'' the economy.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's exceptionalism would make it easier for the next man married to a president to continue his career while living in the White House -- something no first lady has done. For example, Senator Elizabeth Warren's husband, Bruce Mann, who is a law professor at Harvard, would have a far easier time continuing to teach if his wife ever became president because of the way Mr. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  could transform what it means for a man to be married to the leader of the free world.\par \par \uc2 The former president would probably not be asked to take up the household duties we expected career-driven women like \uc2 Michelle Obama\uc2  and \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  to embrace as presidential spouses. The Clintons will most likely pick an experienced social secretary who can handle details usually assigned to the first lady, including giving final approval to floral arrangements, guest lists and dinner menus.\par \par \uc2 Clinton\uc2  insiders doubt that Mr. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  will take up residence in the quiet East Wing, where first ladies have generally been confined. ''Personally, I can't imagine his office in the East Wing,'' said Melanne Verveer, \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's chief of staff in the White House. In fact, friends of the Clintons use terms like ''special envoy'' and ''elder statesman'' when they consider what his expansive role would look like.\par \par \uc2 In the past, Americans have been largely unforgiving of perceived lapses when it comes to first ladies. A member of Franklin Delano Roosevelt's administration grumbled that Eleanor Roosevelt, the original activist first lady, should ''stick to her knitting''; Rosalynn Carter earned the nicknames ''steel magnolia'' and ''the second president'' because she sat in on her husband's cabinet meetings and quietly took notes. West Wing staff members called \uc2 Nancy Reagan\uc2  ''the missus'' behind her back, and the press contemptuously referred to her as ''Queen Nancy'' because of her designer clothes.\par \par \uc2 When \uc2 Barbara Bush\uc2  was first lady, students at \uc2 Wellesley College\uc2  protested the decision to have her speak at their graduation, arguing that she was chosen only because of the man she married. \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's approval ratings plummeted after she moved into an office in the West Wing -- the first time a first lady had done that -- and when she was appointed by her husband to lead the failed health care overhaul. And critics called \uc2 Michelle Obama\uc2 's signature campaign to end childhood obesity the ''food police.''\par \par \uc2 Name a first lady and she has been reprimanded for being too outspoken or too reserved, too controlling or not ambitious enough.\par \par \uc2 Recent first ladies will undoubtedly envy the freedom a first gentleman \uc2 Bill \uc2 Clinton\uc2  would be granted if his wife wins the \uc2 election\uc2 . He's not perfect, which means he is perfectly suited to remake the role of presidential spouse.\par \par \uc2 Kate Andersen Brower is the author of ''First Women: The Grace and Power of America's Modern First Ladies.''\par \par \uc2 Document NYTF000020160726ec7q0006m\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 THE INTERPRETER\par \uc2 Foreign Desk; SECT\par \b \uc2 In D.N.C. Hack, Echoes of Russia's New Approach to Power\b0\par\par\uc2 By MAX FISHER \par \uc2 1,238 \uc2 words\par \uc2 26 July 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 The New York Times on the Web\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Of the questions raised by charges that Russia was involved in the release of hacked \uc2 Democratic National Committee\uc2  emails, at least one -- why would Russia do such a thing? -- can be answered with a little-noticed but influential 2013 Russian military journal article.\par \par \uc2 ''The very rules of war have changed,'' Gen. Valery V. Gerasimov, the chief of the general staff, wrote in the Military-Industrial Courier.\par \par \uc2 The Arab Spring, according to General Gerasimov, had shown that ''nonmilitary means'' had overtaken the "force of weapons in their effectiveness.'' Deception and disinformation, not tanks and planes, were the new tools of power. And they would be used not in formally declared conflicts but within a vast gray between peace and war.\par \par \uc2 Those ideas would appear, the next year, in Russia's formal military doctrine. It was the culmination of a yearslong strategic reorientation that has remade Russian power, in response to threats both real and imagined, into the sort of enterprise that could be plausibly accused of using cyberattacks to meddle in an American presidential \uc2 election\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 'We are protecting our sovereignty'\par \par \uc2 Like so many military rethinks, what became known as the Gerasimov Doctrine began as an effort to solve a seemingly urgent problem.\par \par \uc2 Throughout the 2000s, popular uprisings in Eastern Europe and Central Asia overturned their pro-Kremlin leaders, replacing them with democratically elected governments more inclined to the West.\par \par \uc2 In Moscow, these ''color revolutions,'' as well as the subsequent Arab Spring, were seen as a wave of hostile American operations, engineered to topple Russia's allies and weaken Russia itself.\par \par \uc2 Sergei Shoigu\uc2 , the Russian defense minister, said in a 2014 speech that such uprisings were ''used as an excuse to replace nationally oriented governments with regimes controlled from abroad.''\par \par \uc2 The Kremlin felt encircled and threatened by what it took to be a vast American conspiracy whose ultimate goal, it concluded, was the subjugation or outright destruction of the Russian state.\par \par \uc2 In December 2011, thousands gathered in Moscow to protest legislative elections that had been marred by accusations of fraud. The demonstrations didn't come to much, but they engendered a fear among Russian leaders that they were next.\par \par \uc2 President \uc2 Vladimir V. Putin\uc2 , at a news conference in 2014, warned that the West was seeking to ''defang'' the Russian bear -- to remove its nuclear weapons so as to gain access to its natural resources.\par \par \uc2 ''Once they've taken out his claws and his fangs, then the bear is no longer necessary,'' Mr. Putin said. ''The issue is that we are protecting our sovereignty and our right to exist.''\par \par \uc2 Russian military planners, apparently obsessed with such fears, concluded that their best defense would be to go on the offense. Believing that the Americans were already conducting a clandestine war through intelligence operations, media disinformation, and deniable proxy forces, they set out to do the same.\par \par \uc2 The phrase ''hybrid war'' -- a common label in the West for Russia's actions -- was first used by Russian analysts to describe the supposed American tactics they believed they were countering. They called their own strategy something different: ''new generation war.''\par \par \uc2 Projecting power beyond Russia's strength\par \par \uc2 Even before this doctrine became formalized, Russia had developed tools of coercion and subterfuge, providing a model for wider usage.\par \par \uc2 As Russian power has resurged under Mr. Putin, the country has often used asymmetrical methods to assert its interests, particularly in the former Soviet republics it still considers its ''near abroad'' and rightful zone of influence.\par \par \uc2 In 2007, amid tensions with the small Eastern European nation of Estonia, Russian media falsely reported that members of Estonia's Russian minority were being drugged and tortured by police, contributing to riots that injured several people and killed one. The next day, cyberattacks, attributed to a pre-Kremlin Russian group, forced many of Estonia's major institutions offline.\par \par \uc2 At no point, in the 2007 episode, did Russia commit an act of military aggression against its neighbor. Yet Estonian leaders say these actions were meant as a message: Even if their country had joined \uc2 NATO\uc2  and the \uc2 European Union\uc2 , Moscow was still the boss.\par \par \uc2 These sorts of tools allowed Russia to project power beyond its strength and, just as importantly, to assert its interests abroad despite Western military and political dominance.\par \par \uc2 To paraphrase Mark Galeotti, a New York University professor who studies Russia's military, this is a country whose economy is smaller than Canada's or South Korea's, yet is seeking a great power role akin to China or the United States. Traditional methods won't cut it.\par \par \uc2 Information struggle and Maidan technology\par \par \uc2 Russia deployed its "new generation war'' to startling effect in early 2014, when, amid Ukraine's political crisis, it seized and subsequently annexed the Ukrainian region of Crimea.\par \par \uc2 While that action is most remembered for the ''little green men'' -- unmarked Russian special forces who seized key locations in a clandestine invasion -- there were subtler components as well.\par \par \uc2 Russian state news media flooded Crimea's airwaves with false stories about neo-Nazis taking over Ukraine and systematically attacking ethnic Russians, who are a majority in Crimea. As a result, many Crimeans welcomed the unmarked Russian troops, believing they were being saved from possible ethnic cleansing.\par \par \uc2 Dmitry Adamsky, an Israeli analyst, wrote in a 2015 report that this ''information struggle'' is central to Russia's new strategy.\par \par \uc2 This information war, he wrote, ''comprises both technological and psychological components designed to manipulate the adversary's picture of reality, misinform it and eventually interfere with the decision-making process of individuals, organizations, governments and societies.''\par \par \uc2 While this was especially visible in Crimea, Mr. Adamsky warned that it was also deployed in peacetime and against any target where Moscow seeks influence. It may be intended to pursue a ''strategic goal,'' such as the weakening of pro-American political parties in Europe, or to simply foment a degree of instability that weakens adversaries.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Adamsky described this as a form of ''subversion'' that ''aims to deceive the victim, discredit the leadership, and disorient and demoralize the population and the armed forces.''\par \par \uc2 That sheds light on why Russia might want to release \uc2 Democratic National Committee\uc2  emails, whose greatest effect is creating a kerfuffle within Democratic politics. It's not as if the resignation of the party chairwoman, \uc2 Debbie Wasserman Schultz\uc2 , was some strategic Russian ambition.\par \par \uc2 While some observers say Moscow sees a potential friend in Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , it would also be well within Russian strategy to stir up trouble just to stir up trouble. This is what Mr. Adamsky calls ''managed stability-instability'' -- low-level confusion and disunity that Russia could perhaps one day exploit.\par \par \uc2 Russia has long seen itself as the victim of these very tactics, accusing Western governments of using vague ''Maidan technology,'' named for the square where Ukraine's 2014 protests began, to create ''managed chaos'' in targeted countries. Embarrassing stories, such as the Russian doping scandal and the Panama Papers, are seen as American information warfare meant to weaken Moscow.\par \par \uc2 In this view, Kremlin leaders could see releasing internal Democratic emails as a tit-for-tat retaliation in the information struggle. Such a thing would make little sense in the Western conception of geopolitics. But as Mr. Adamsky wrote in his 2015 study, Americans have long tried to conceptualize Russian strategy within Western ways of thinking, when it is anything but.\par \par \uc2 Document NYTF000020160726ec7q0007s\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 PHILADELPHIA -- Dear Hillary,\par \par \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  has presented you with an amazing opportunity to become a world historical figure! If you crush him in this \uc2 election\uc2 , you could create a new Democratic majority and reduce the G.O.P. to an ever-declining rump of ethnic nationalism. On the other hand, if you fail to beat \uc2 Trump\uc2 , you will go down as America's most hapless political loser and be vilified forever for enabling an era of American Putinism.\par \par \uc2 No pressure! Have fun in Philadelphia!\par \par \uc2 To end up on the right side of this equation you're probably going to have to resist three natural tendencies, two of them your party's and one your own.\par \par \uc2 First, you're going to have to fight your party's materialistic mind-set.\par \par \uc2 This is 2016, not 1992. Over the past few years, economic and social anxiety has metastasized into something spiritual and existential.\par \par \uc2 Americans are no longer confident in their national project. They no longer trust their institutions or have faith in their common destiny. This is a crisis of national purpose. It's about personal identity and the basic health of communal life. Americans' anger and pessimism are more fundamental than anything that can be explained by G.D.P. statistics.\par \par \uc2 Many Democrats have trouble thinking in these terms. When asked to explain any complex phenomenon, they instinctively reduce it to a materialist cause. If there's terrorism there must be lack of economic opportunity. If marriage is declining it must be because of joblessness.\par \par \uc2 This materialistic mind-set means that many Democrats are perpetually surprised by events that involve cultural threats and national identity. Why don't working-class Kansans vote for us? We offer them more programs. Why did the Brits leave the E.U.? It's against their economic interest.\par \par \uc2 The mind-set is also reductionist. There's a tendency to break national problems into small, interest-group-size chunks and then deliver pandering policy promises.\par \par \uc2 Look at your website. As Oren Cass points out in The City Journal, every demographic or interest group gets its own pander. If you're a horse lover, the \uc2 Clinton\uc2  campaign vows to crack down on ''horse soring, in which chemicals or other inhumane methods are applied to horses' limbs to exaggerate their gait.''\par \par \uc2 If Democrats wage that kind of niche-targeted campaign this year they will lose. Voters are worried that the whole society is falling apart. If Democrats think a crisis of national identity can be addressed with targeted tax credits they are living in a different century.\par \par \uc2 To stand a chance, Secretary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , you're probably going to have to talk as adeptly about threats to personal dignity as you do about day care. You're probably going to have to talk bluntly about the American civic religion. You're going to have to show you understand the way members of your class have slighted people who are less educated and less cosmopolitan.\par \par \uc2 Second, you're going to have to fight the Sanders tide, which on Day 1 of this convention was astoundingly strong. Many Democrats have grown hostile to capitalism. Sixty percent of Democrats are friendly to socialism, according to a poll by OnMessage Inc. and the American Action Network.\par \par \uc2 Of course, this is general \uc2 election\uc2  suicide. If you want a perfect way to turn off suburban service economy office park workers who will decide this \uc2 election\uc2 , then the Bernie Sanders route is it! The economic nostalgia of the left is as futile as the demographic nostalgia of the right.\par \par \uc2 Somehow you're going to have to come up with an updated muscular Clintonism. For 30 years your name has stood for a Democratic governing style that is internationalist in foreign affairs, socially moderate and pro-global integration (while softening its edges). That open, optimistic approach has to be combined with a more aggressive and radical effort to help people compete in the new economy.\par \par \uc2 Third, you're going to have to answer hatred with love. Your tendency so far in your career has been to answer hostility with distrust, and secretiveness.\par \par \uc2 You've ended up projecting coldness but also weakness and hurt. People who build emotional walls amid conflict do so out of fear, not strength.\par \par \uc2 Along the way you've made yourself phenomenally unpopular. The polls show that you are now just as distrusted by the American people as \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  is.\par \par \uc2 The confident move is to break out of the emotional bunker with vulnerability. The sign of strength is to answer the ''Lock Her Up'' enmity with a confident honest account of what it feels like to be you -- embroiled in the political combat, encased in this global celebrity role, but maintaining authenticity in a world that conspires against it.\par \par \uc2 Imagine if you displayed honest self-appraisal and even moments of remorse. You'd have the world rooting for you, not against you.\par \par \uc2 This convention is about resetting relationships: establishing trust between you and voters, restoring optimism that we can thrive in the modern economy, redefining a soul satisfying faith in the American project.\par \par \uc2 Follow The \uc2 New York Times\uc2  Opinion section on \uc2 Facebook\uc2  and \uc2 Twitter\uc2  (@NYTopinion), and sign up for the Opinion Today newsletter.\par \par \uc2 Document NYTF000020160726ec7q0006l\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 ON WASHINGTON\par \uc2 National Desk; SECTA\par \b \uc2 For a Party Chairwoman, Loyalty (to \uc2 Clinton\uc2 ) Was Seen as a Fault\b0\par\par\uc2 By CARL HULSE \par \uc2 1,140 \uc2 words\par \uc2 26 July 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 15\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 PHILADELPHIA -- Ed Rendell, the former Democratic governor of Pennsylvania, recalls that he and \uc2 Debbie Wasserman Schultz\uc2  were such die-hard loyalists of \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  in 2008 that they came to be known as the ''last of the Mohicans.''\par \par \uc2 He and Ms. Wasserman Schultz, the soon to be ex-head of the \uc2 Democratic National Committee\uc2 , were among a final devoted few who would appear on television on behalf of Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  even as \uc2 Barack Obama\uc2  tightened his grip on the nomination and the party. That past allegiance to Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  left Ms. Wasserman Schultz liable this year to charges of favoritism in conducting the party primary and contributed to her sudden downfall on Sunday.\par \par \uc2 ''The problem is that she was just such a Hillary supporter,'' said Mr. Rendell, who led the committee at the end of the administration of President \uc2 Clinton\uc2 . ''She was such an avid Hillary supporter that I think it was hard for her to stay neutral.''\par \par \uc2 The perception that she had put her thumb on the scale for Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  over Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont was reinforced by the release of internal committee emails that showed a dismissive attitude toward Mr. Sanders. The result was her ouster at what should have been a moment of triumph as Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , the woman Ms. Wasserman Schultz so reveres, accepts the nomination.\par \par \uc2 At a breakfast for the Florida convention delegation on Monday morning, supporters of Mr. Sanders greeted Ms. Wasserman Schultz with boos and shouts of ''Shame.'' She was hurried out of the room by staff members. A few hours later, she told her hometown newspaper, The Sun-Sentinel, that she would no longer even gavel the convention to order in the interest of avoiding an ugly scene.\par \par \uc2 It was a bitter outcome for an ambitious politician who had survived serious criticism for her leadership of the party and whose name appears prominently on the ubiquitous entry credentials for the convention -- a testament to the leading role she was supposed to play here.\par \par \uc2 But the chairwoman, a House member from a heavily Democratic, retiree-centric district in South Florida, had become toxic. She realized that she had to go, allies say, rather than become a major distraction at the start of the festivities. She did not want to present an image of party disunity like that seen at the Republican convention in Cleveland, when Senator Ted Cruz pointedly refused to endorse \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Democrats know they need to retain a significant portion of those who had supported Mr. Sanders, who spoke Monday night. They acknowledged that wooing them was going to be hard with the Florida congresswoman remaining as head of the party.\par \par \uc2 ''It was a tough decision and it ended up being the only decision,'' said Representative Steve Israel, the New York Democrat and a longtime colleague of Ms. Wasserman Schultz. ''She made the best decision she could make for the party.''\par \par \uc2 Allies of Ms. Wasserman Schultz said she rejected the notion that she did not remain neutral in the primary. They note that the most troubling emails seeming to undermine Mr. Sanders came from her staff.\par \par \uc2 But she agreed to step down on Sunday after concluding that the furor would not die down, a decision met with relief across the party and with satisfaction by Mr. Sanders and his backers who believed she had it coming.\par \par \uc2 Advisers to the party chairwoman said that \uc2 Clinton\uc2  emissaries who visited Ms. Wasserman Schultz at her convention hotel on Sunday said Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  would support her if she wanted to remain in the job but she should brace for tumult if she did. Ms. Wasserman Schultz did not want the convention she had worked so hard to organize to be upset by her own role, one friend said, who did want to speak publicly during such a difficult time for Ms. Wasserman Schultz.\par \par \uc2 Once she made her choice, she notified David Simas, the political director at the White House, and then received a call from President Obama, who had appointed her to the post in 2011 and backed her for a second term this year despite grumbling from party insiders.\par \par \uc2 On the call, those with knowledge of it who did not want to be identified discussing a private conversation, said the president expressed his gratitude for her work for both him and the party, including putting the D.N.C. on better financial footing. They also reminisced about shared political battles.\par \par \uc2 Ms. Wasserman Schultz also heard from Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , who promised to support her in an unexpectedly tough primary against Tim Canova, a law professor and Sanders backer whose campaign has benefited from an influx of money and enthusiasm as a result of her perceived bias against Mr. Sanders. Allies of Ms. Wasserman Schultz say her departure from the post should allow her to concentrate on her re-\uc2 election\uc2 . Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  also told Ms. Wasserman Schultz that she wanted her to remain active in the campaign.\par \par \uc2 Elected to the House in 2004 after serving in the Florida legislature, Ms. Wasserman Schultz, 49, was always seen as a politician looking to quickly advance, an attribute that occasionally irritated some of her colleagues.\par \par \uc2 During Mr. Obama's 2012 run, Ms. Wasserman Schultz clashed with the presidential campaign over various party efforts, including her push to establish a women's program that was seen as duplicative of the campaign. Critics claimed that Ms. Wasserman Schultz would often put her own interests ahead of those of the party, a complaint that underscored the difficulties of holding two demanding jobs.\par \par \uc2 ''She had the challenge of not only being chair of the national committee, but also being an elected member of Congress. She had to balance that,'' said former Senator Bob Graham of Florida, who worked with Ms. Wasserman Schultz over the years.\par \par \uc2 She was seen as successful in advancing voting rights and women's issues and was credited with sheer determination for holding onto the job as long as she did given the difficult and disparate factions in the Democratic Party.\par \par \uc2 But unhappiness with her accelerated this year with complaints by Mr. Sanders that she was limiting debates to bolster Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 . After a tumultuous party caucus in Nevada, Senator Harry Reid, the Nevada Democrat and party leader, began urging the White House and the \uc2 Clinton\uc2  campaign to replace her.\par \par \uc2 The emails, coming as the convention was set to open, proved to be too much. In a year when the Republican Party has seen such intense disruption, it was the head of the Democratic Party who ended up out of a job.\par \par \uc2 Find out what you need to know about the 2016 presidential race today, and get politics news updates via \uc2 Facebook\uc2 , \uc2 Twitter\uc2  and the First Draft newsletter.\par \par \uc2 Document NYTF000020160726ec7q0007n\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

Andrew E. Kramer contributed reporting from Moscow, David M. Herszenhorn from Washington, and Doris Burke from New York. \par \uc2 1,626 \uc2 words\par \uc2 26 July 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 1\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 WASHINGTON -- As \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2  prepared to take his beauty pageant to Moscow in 2013, he relished the participation of one man above all: President \uc2 Vladimir V. Putin\uc2 . ''Do you think Putin will be going to The Miss Universe Pageant in November in Moscow -- if so, will he become my new best friend?'' he wrote on \uc2 Twitter\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Mr. Putin did not attend -- in fact, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  has yet to meet him, by all accounts -- but his admiration for the Russian leader, shared by some of his campaign advisers, is clear. It stems from an affinity for brash, swaggering politics and business dealings in Russia that has overturned decades of Republican orthodoxy about Russia and its leader as an aggressive authoritarian whose values are inimical to those of the United States.\par \par \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , by contrast, has a far more contentious history with Mr. Putin, despite the ''reset'' President Obama's administration pursued with Russia during her tenure as secretary of state. In 2011, Mr. Putin accused her of instigating the huge protests that erupted after parliamentary elections marred by fraud.\par \par \uc2 ''She set the tone for some actors in our country and gave them a signal,'' he said darkly, going on to accuse her of engaging in ''active work,'' an old term of art for covert K.G.B. operations. When she compared Russia's intervention in Ukraine to Hitler's moves in the 1930s, he said she had ''never been too graceful with her statements.''\par \par \uc2 Now the question has emerged in the United States \uc2 election\uc2  campaign whether Mr. Putin has opted -- directly or covertly -- to throw Russia's support behind Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 . The conclusion by cybersecurity experts that Russian intelligence agencies breached the \uc2 Democratic National Committee\uc2  and released thousands of emails on the eve of the party's convention prompted accusations from Democrats and some Republicans that Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  was a kind of ''Siberian candidate,'' bolstered from abroad to undermine the nation.\par \par \uc2 ''Given \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2 's well-known admiration for Putin and his belittling of \uc2 NATO\uc2 , the Russians have both the means and the motive to engage in a hack of the D.N.C. and the dump of its emails prior to the Democratic convention,'' Rep. Adam Schiff of California, a Democrat who is the ranking member of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, said in a statement on Monday.\par \par \uc2 ''That foreign actors may be trying to influence our \uc2 election\uc2  -- let alone a powerful adversary like Russia -- should concern all Americans of any party,'' he added.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  dismissed the idea as a joke, and his campaign chairman, \uc2 Paul Manafort\uc2 , called it ''crazy'' in remarks broadcast on \uc2 CNN\uc2 . ''I don't even know what you're talking about,'' he said.\par \par \uc2 Just four years ago, the Republican presidential candidate \uc2 Mitt Romney\uc2  called Russia the No. 1 geopolitical threat to the United States, a remark that was criticized at the time by Democrats but that seemed to anticipate the souring of relations after the annexation of Crimea from Ukraine in 2014.\par \par \uc2 As her campaign approached, Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , too, sharpened her tone on the threat Mr. Putin posed, distancing herself in her book ''Hard Choices'' from a ''reset'' widely seen as a failure. Now it is Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  who sees -- though not always -- a new era of cooperation, ''because Putin likes me,'' as he put it on \uc2 Twitter\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's dabbling in business in the country dates to the Soviet era, when he visited Moscow in 1987 at the invitation of the Soviet ambassador to the United States, Yuri Dubinin, who had mentioned at a lunch in New York that his daughter had admired \uc2 Trump\uc2  Tower. ''He actually suggested that we make a similar statement in Moscow,'' Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  said at the time.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's plans for a \uc2 Trump\uc2  Tower in Russia never came to fruition, but his interest in the country as a potential investment and marketing opportunity never waned entirely, as his decision to stage the Miss Universe pageant at a concert hall in one of Moscow's deluxe shopping centers, Crocus City, demonstrated.\par \par \uc2 As his campaign took shape this year, he turned to advisers who shared his views on Russia. Mr. Manafort has had extensive financial and political dealings with business executives in Russia and Ukraine.\par \par \uc2 Beginning in 2005, he worked as a political strategist in Ukraine for Viktor Yanukovych and his Party of Regions, which struggled to regain power after his first \uc2 election\uc2  as president in late 2004 was overturned as fraudulent, in what became known as the Orange Revolution. According to one of several cables disclosed by \uc2 WikiLeaks\uc2  in 2010, Mr. Yanukovych told the American ambassador at the time that he intended to ''build Regions into a party that had a platform and policies.''\par \par \uc2 ''Doing so was important for the development of democracy in Ukraine, he asserted,'' according to the cable. Mr. Yanukovych won the presidency in 2010, only to be ousted in the political upheaval that prompted the Russian intervention in Crimea and later in eastern Ukraine.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Manafort also had business investments in the region, some of which were detailed in a lawsuit filed in New York in 2011 by Mr. Yanukovych's rival, Yulia Tymoshenko. Although the suit was dismissed, it detailed connections with a Ukrainian gas middleman, Dmytro Firtash, and a reputed kingpin of the Russian mob, Semyon Y. Mogilevich, as well as with another Russian tycoon, \uc2 Oleg Deripaska\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 In the lawsuit, Ms. Tymoshenko claimed that Mr. Manafort had helped Mr. Firtash in a project to use illicit proceeds from gas deals to buy and redevelop the former Drake Hotel on Park Avenue in Manhattan. The United States tried to extradite Mr. Firtash from Austria, but the request was turned down in 2015.\par \par \uc2 Adrian Karatnycky, an expert on Ukraine at \uc2 the Atlantic Council\uc2 , said that he viewed Mr. Manafort as a canny strategist and businessman. ''I don't see Manafort going in as an agent of Russian imperialism, but of personal opportunism,'' he said.\par \par \uc2 Another adviser to Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's campaign, Carter Page, also lived and worked in Russia, serving as a consultant with \uc2 Gazprom\uc2 , the state-owned energy giant. In July, he delivered a graduation speech at the New Economic School in Moscow in which he warned that hostility between the United States and Russia, reminiscent of the Cold War, was a mistake.\par \par \uc2 While Mr. Putin has scrupulously avoided endorsing either candidate in the United States campaign, the tenor of coverage by the state news media has clearly favored Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 . He is portrayed as a populist break from the past, while from Russia's point of view, Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  embodies the worst aspects of an aggressive, antagonistic American establishment.\par \par \uc2 ''They don't really expect much from a \uc2 Clinton\uc2  presidency other than continued confrontation, while they view a \uc2 Trump\uc2  presidency as a window for improved relations,'' said Vladimir Frolov, the foreign affairs columnist for the online magazine Slon.ru.\par \par \uc2 A report on Sunday on the weekly television program Vesti Nedeli cited an interview with The \uc2 New York Times\uc2  in which Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  suggested that American protection for the Baltic nations would not be automatic if he were elected, despite the collective defense clause in the \uc2 NATO\uc2  treaty.\par \par \uc2 ''Such a practical look at the alliance shocked the American establishment, for whom \uc2 NATO\uc2  has long been a cult, as it is the main instrument of the U.S. for dominance in Europe,'' the television report asserted, showing photographs of American headlines calling Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  an agent and lap dog of Mr. Putin.\par \par \uc2 In December, when Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's candidacy was still relatively young, Mr. Putin praised him, when asked, as flamboyant and talented. In a more recent appearance, at the St. Petersburg International Economic Forum, he welcomed Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's stated goal of improving relations. ''What's wrong with that?'' Mr. Putin said, prompting applause from an audience that included business executives eager to resume smooth economic relations.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  has boasted about Mr. Putin's flattery, but his remarks on \uc2 Twitter\uc2  have been far from consistently positive toward the Russian leader. ''What do you think Obama will do when Putin seizes Alaska?'' he posted in March 2014, days after the annexation of Crimea. A month later, he quoted an evident admirer: ''President \uc2 Trump\uc2 , now that would make Putin wet himself!''\par \par \uc2 An irony for Russia, of course, is that interference in another country's political process is precisely what Mr. Putin has accused the United States of doing for at least the last 12 years.\par \par \uc2 Matthew Rojansky, the director of the Kennan Institute at the \uc2 Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars\uc2 , said that while it was plausible that Russian intelligence agencies were behind the breach and leaked the emails, it did not necessarily follow that Moscow had a favorite.\par \par \uc2 He said the leak more likely would reflect a goal ''to stir the pot,'' as Russia has done with support of insurgent parties in Europe. Mr. Putin, he said, had to be aware that direct intervention could well backfire with American voters, especially those in swing states like Ohio and Pennsylvania with roots in Poland, Ukraine or the Baltics.\par \par \uc2 ''Could Putin really be that stupid?'' he asked.\par \par \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2  on Monday in Roanoke, Va. He dismissed the idea that Russia might have tried to influence the presidential race.

\par\par \uc2 Metropolitan Desk; SECTA\par \b \uc2 Bratton, Face of 'Broken Windows,' Aims to Mend Racial Fences\b0\par\par\uc2 By AL BAKER and J. DAVID GOODMAN \par \uc2 4,281 \uc2 words\par \uc2 26 July 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 1\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 After two New York City officers were shot dead in their patrol car in 2014, \uc2 William J. Bratton\uc2 , the police commissioner, drew on words of reconciliation spoken to him years before by a black Los Angeles activist known as Sweet Alice Harris. He turned to those words repeatedly this month after the killing of eight officers in Texas and Louisiana.\par \par \uc2 ''We need to find ways to see each other,'' Mr. Bratton told national television audiences on two consecutive Sundays.\par \par \uc2 This was a call for the police and minority communities, caught in a searing divide, to recognize each other's humanity as certain events were repeating themselves: the killing of black men by officers in Baton Rouge, La., and Minnesota and the killing of officers days later by gunmen targeting the police in Dallas and Baton Rouge.\par \par \uc2 The conciliatory tone would have sounded at odds with Mr. Bratton's public persona two decades ago, when he first served as New York's police commissioner. With a Churchillian rallying cry, he unleashed officers to fight crime block by block.\par \par \uc2 ''I did not come here to lose,'' Mr. Bratton said in 1993 upon accepting the job, which brought him international acclaim as he oversaw a significant drop in crime.\par \par \uc2 But faced with an unceasing nationwide drumbeat of black and Hispanic men and women killed by the police and an intensifying danger of reprisals against officers, Mr. Bratton is now challenged to put the leash back on his ranks.\par \par \uc2 The trouble for Mr. Bratton, whose name has long been synonymous with a hard-charging, crime-busting mentality, is that many seeking criminal justice reform see him as part of the problem, if not a key player in its origins. The most strident of them consider Mr. Bratton a relic, too moored to the past to usher in quick change.\par \par \uc2 This tension has defined Mr. Bratton's return for a second stint as the city's police commissioner in 2014. How might he dial back the aggressive crime-fighting practices that sowed discord in minority communities when, in many cases, he created those policies and promoted them across the country? A cadre of police commanders who served under Mr. Bratton took over departments across the United States. His methods -- a withering attention to small crimes, a data-driven oversight system known as CompStat -- were adopted by cities large and small.\par \par \uc2 The face of American policing for decades, Mr. Bratton has rarely been in the public eye more than in the past three weeks. The United States Homeland Security secretary, Jeh Johnson, stood by his side in New York to urge calm after the Dallas officer killings. They appeared together in consecutive interviews on national television.\par \par \uc2 But as he seeks to tackle entrenched mistrust between officers and the minority communities they protect, Mr. Bratton, 68, is taking on arguably the most difficult task of his career, during what he has said is the final lap of his more than 45 years in policing.\par \par \uc2 In an interview on Thursday, Mr. Bratton said his tenure would not last beyond Mayor \uc2 Bill de Blasio\uc2 's first term in office.\par \par \uc2 ''I'm not going to stay into a second term,'' Mr. Bratton said, opening the door to a departure even sooner.\par \par \uc2 His legacy, this time, will not hinge on a reduction in crime, already whittled to the bone in many neighborhoods. The challenge is far more abstract, with success hard to quantify. Some have doubted his zeal for change as he has surrounded himself with top advisers from his early decades in policing and staunchly defended his continued focus on quality-of-life issues.\par \par \uc2 ''\uc2 Bill Bratton\uc2  appears to be at times a reluctant reformer,'' said Representative Hakeem Jeffries, a Brooklyn Democrat and a leading proponent of criminal justice reform who has been mentioned as a possible candidate for mayor in next year's \uc2 election\uc2 . ''He says no, no, no, no, no, and then he says yes. But he says yes on his timeline, and usually on negotiated terms.''\par \par \uc2 Racial tensions that have surrounded the police for generations marked defining moments in Mr. Bratton's career: as a young officer in 1970s Boston during the city's bitter fights over school desegregation; as police chief in Los Angeles, still reeling more than a decade after the 1991 beating of Rodney King by officers and the ensuing riots; as commissioner in New York City in 2014, when Eric Garner died after officers tried to arrest him on Staten Island for selling loose cigarettes. But for long stretches, those concerns took a back seat to a focus on crime.\par \par \uc2 Times are different now. The Obama administration has offered a blueprint for the police to rebuild trust. \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, has distanced herself from comments about criminals made during her husband's tough-on-crime tenure; the \uc2 Black Lives Matter movement\uc2  is seeking fairness across the criminal justice landscape.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Bratton believes that he and his department have changed with the times. ''Everything everybody is advocating for, we're already doing,'' Mr. Bratton said in an interview in March, a sentiment he echoed in recent weeks.\par \par \uc2 At the same time, he is buffeted by the specter of terrorism and by a corruption scandal embroiling top commanders, as well as the sort of gun violence and labor strife that bedevil many police leaders. His department, the nation's largest municipal force, is under more external oversight than at any time in its history.\par \par \uc2 Since his return to the \uc2 New York Police Department\uc2 , Mr. Bratton has been shaping how he will be remembered, in speeches and in interviews with media outlets as varied as \uc2 The New Yorker\uc2  and Dan's Papers, a local newspaper in the \uc2 Hamptons\uc2 , where he and his wife, Rikki Klieman, have a home. He has already met with the co-author of his first memoir, according to his daily schedule.\par \par \uc2 Long a master image-maker, Mr. Bratton has presented himself as a mix of military general and Wall Street executive. Now, he is remaking his image, casting himself in the role of an oncologist administering the right dose of chemotherapy to a cancer patient.\par \par \uc2 ''Because crime is continuing to go down,'' he said, the Police Department was ''adjusting to the patient.'' But, he added, speaking of aggressive enforcement: ''Is there a point of time where we might have to increase it? Possibly, but not right now.''\par \par \uc2 Boston and New York\par \par \uc2 Boston in 1978 was reeling from a battle over public school desegregation. Rocks crashed through windows and into the homes of black families in the Dorchester neighborhood. Officers responded slowly, if at all.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Bratton, then a lieutenant in the Boston Police Department, helped diagnose the problem, said Robert Wasserman, Mr. Bratton's mentor there: The episodes had been written off as minor vandalism even as they fueled racial tensions and negative headlines in The \uc2 Boston Globe\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 With Mr. Bratton's insight, the department made such cases a top priority and formed a special unit to respond to them immediately. Mr. Bratton helped choose the unit's leader, Francis M. Roache, who later became Boston's police commissioner.\par \par \uc2 The experience was an early brush with race relations and with the power of low-level crime to have big effects on disorder and fear, a phenomenon Mr. Bratton said he also witnessed as a police liaison to Boston's gay community.\par \par \uc2 But it was an effort to calm the turmoil in the neighborhoods around Fenway Park that would have a profound effect on his career and, nearly four decades later, shape his policing strategy for New York in 2016.\par \par \uc2 A neighborhood policing program, designed by Mr. Wasserman, now an adviser to the New York Police Department, assigned officers to sections of the city with the task of solving minor crimes and quality-of-life offenses. The mantra was problem solving and community engagement. Many of the issues officers heard about were small, though crime was high at the time. Noise was a common complaint.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Bratton would view it as early proof of a theory, later articulated by the academics James Q. Wilson and George L. Kelling, that would become the hallmark of his policing approach: officers aggressively pursuing minor offenses to prevent major ones.\par \par \uc2 ''Six years before Wilson and Kelling wrote 'Broken Windows,' I was experiencing it and I was living it,'' Mr. Bratton said.\par \par \uc2 But the theory was never a perfect fit for police officers, Mr. Kelling said recently, because it called on them to address problems, not necessarily make arrests. Over the years, many police leaders used it to justify high arrest rates for minor offenses, often in minority areas, he said.\par \par \uc2 ''It easily turns into a quota system,'' said Mr. Kelling, also now an adviser to the New York Police Department. (Mr. Bratton has strongly denied that any such system emerged in New York.)\par \par \uc2 When he took over New York City's transit police force in 1990, the city's peak year for homicides, at 2,245, Mr. Bratton focused on officers' activity. Racial tensions were not a leading concern.\par \par \uc2 And as crime declined, arrests soared.\par \par \uc2 After briefly returning to Boston as police commissioner, Mr. Bratton came back to New York, hired by a new law-and-order mayor, \uc2 Rudolph W. Giuliani\uc2 , to lead the city's police force. ''He shared with me the same vision'' of beating back an onslaught of crime, Mr. Giuliani, a Republican, said.\par \par \uc2 ''American policing has been swatting at mosquitoes for 20 years,'' Mr. Bratton said at the time. ''In New York, we've learned how to drain the swamp.''\par \par \uc2 A community policing program that had been championed by the previous mayor, the Democrat David N. Dinkins, and his police commissioners, Lee P. Brown and Raymond W. Kelly, was assailed by Mr. Giuliani; the administration leaked critical internal memos. Though Mr. Bratton had expressed support for the concept, he scrapped the program in 1994 as ineffectual.\par \par \uc2 ''You can't send the Red Cross onto the battlefield before the infantry,'' said John J. Miller, then the Police Department's chief spokesman and now its deputy commissioner for intelligence and counterterrorism.\par \par \uc2 Soon Mr. Bratton was on the cover of Time and enmeshed in a tug of war with Mr. Giuliani over credit for the transformation of the city's streets. In April 1996, with crime nationwide in the early stages of a two-decade-long downswing, Mr. Bratton resigned.\par \par \uc2 ''We had a little bit of a Truman-MacArthur problem,'' Mr. Giuliani said, referring to the Korean War-era clashes between the president and the general. (Mr. Bratton and Mr. Giuliani reconciled over lunch nearly a decade later in Los Angeles, where Mr. Bratton had become police chief. He joked with Mr. Giuliani that the former mayor had given him the key to the city, ''but then you changed the lock.'')\par \par \uc2 Racial tensions went mostly unaddressed, and flared after Mr. Bratton's departure, notably after the killing of Amadou Diallo, an unarmed black man shot 41 times by Bronx officers in 1999.\par \par \uc2 It was a state of affairs Mr. Bratton came to regret. In a 2000 interview with one of his former aides, Vincent Henry, a retired sergeant, Mr. Bratton raised the idea of a ''peace dividend'' -- a term now frequently invoked by Mr. Bratton -- to refocus the energy of officers away from tough enforcement in an era of lower crime.\par \par \uc2 ''Hopefully the next generation's legacy will be to have successfully reduced or even resolved the race problem,'' Mr. Bratton told him.\par \par \uc2 In Los Angeles\par \par \uc2 After several years of work in the private sector, Mr. Bratton found himself part of a federal monitoring team in Los Angeles. It led him to lobby for the position of police chief, which he received in 2002.\par \par \uc2 Almost immediately after taking over the Los Angeles Police Department, which was plagued by scandal, racial strife and recalcitrant officers, he courted reformers and critics. He brought some of them into the department's fold: Gerald Chaleff, a former criminal defense lawyer who helped examine the department's response to the 1992 riots, and Constance L. Rice, a prominent civil rights lawyer.\par \par \uc2 ''I would arm-wrestle him over broken windows: Don't focus on broken windows, focus on broken families,'' Ms. Rice said. ''He understood what I was saying.''\par \par \uc2 By the time he left in 2009, Mr. Bratton helped put the department on course to emerge from federal oversight. He won praise from advocates like Ms. Rice as well as officers, while never abandoning the aggressive policing practices he had employed in New York. Arrests went up, along with street stops.\par \par \uc2 ''Obviously I was against any kind of increase in arrests,'' Ms. Rice said. But, she added, ''Poor blacks and poor Latinos were willing to give him a lot of credit because things got much safer.''\par \par \uc2 Mr. Bratton, in his return to New York, looked to his experience with the Los Angeles police -- particularly the corps of community officers, known as senior lead officers -- as a touchstone for soothing tensions on the street.\par \par \uc2 ''He was a little bit surprised at how well things turned around there,'' said Stephen P. Davis, the New York Police Department's chief spokesman, who said the success animated Mr. Bratton's desire to tackle race relations in New York. ''It's almost the reverse of Frank Sinatra: If I can do it there, I can do it here.''\par \par \uc2 The Power of Image\par \par \uc2 Aides and critics alike have marveled at Mr. Bratton's preternatural skill as a leader. In the 1990s, he was discussed as a possible New York City mayoral candidate. Since 2014, he has met with hundreds of groups inside and outside the Police Department.\par \par \uc2 His schedules from Jan. 1, 2014, to June 1, 2015, obtained through a Freedom of Information request, resemble those of a politician: breakfast and dinner meetings, speeches, television and radio interviews, regular appearances across the city, frequent trips to Washington.\par \par \uc2 Early in his career, Mr. Bratton recognized the power of image in policing culture: For officers to believe in their mission and the policies of their leaders, they had to view themselves as a force for good. At each agency Mr. Bratton led, he began by surveying officers' morale, with the goal of increasing it.\par \par \uc2 Long before cellphone cameras put video at almost everyone's fingertips, Mr. Bratton embraced video as a way to communicate more directly with the members of the sprawling department, producing messages for officers to hear at roll call, for example.\par \par \uc2 In Los Angeles and then in New York, Mr. Bratton surrounded himself with a cadre of familiar faces from his past, many with expertise in image building, including Mr. Miller, a former reporter, and John Linder, a former \uc2 Metropolitan Transportation Authority\uc2  marketing official.\par \par \uc2 Some, like Mr. Wasserman, Mr. Kelling and Mr. Linder, are part-time consultants to the Police Department, paid by the nonprofit \uc2 New York City Police Foundation\uc2 . Others, like Mr. Chaleff, whom Mr. Bratton met in Los Angeles, have been paid by the city.\par \par \uc2 Advice from the consultants is important enough to Mr. Bratton that his daily schedule often includes their whereabouts at the top. ''George Kelling in office a.m.; Linder and Chaleff in office all day,'' a typical entry from June 4, 2014, reads.\par \par \uc2 That all of them are white is not a concern to Mr. Bratton. ''Who cares?'' he said in the interview on Thursday, recounting his relationships with black officers and community members from his time in Los Angeles and New York. ''I don't care if they're white, black or what, in the sense that, did they get the job done?''\par \par \uc2 Mr. Bratton's schedule also includes regular meetings with his Police Department counsel, Edna Wells Handy, and conversations with \uc2 Charles Phillips\uc2 , a board member of the nonprofit \uc2 Police Foundation\uc2  and a software executive to whom Mr. Bratton turns for discussions of race in the city. Both are African-American.\par \par \uc2 ''No matter how rich they are,'' Mr. Bratton said, most African-Americans have had ''negative experiences'' with the police and ''they all respond the same to these incidents: There is a fear, there's an anger, there's a frustration.''\par \par \uc2 Racial Strife\par \par \uc2 For years, beginning in the early 2000s, New York City police officers ramped up their efforts to stop, question and search people they suspected might be involved in criminal activity.\par \par \uc2 At the height of the stop-and-frisk program, in 2011, during Mr. Kelly's second term as commissioner, officers recorded nearly 700,000 such encounters. Most were with black and Hispanic people, and a vast majority of those searched were neither arrested nor issued a ticket. In 2013, a federal judge declared the practices unconstitutional and installed a federal monitor to reform them.\par \par \uc2 That year, the newly elected mayor, Mr. de Blasio, a Democrat, tapped Mr. Bratton to institute policing reforms while maintaining gains in public safety.\par \par \uc2 To Mr. Bratton's allies, returning to New York seemed risky. ''Are you crazy?'' Mr. Linder recalled telling him.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Linder, who helped write the so-called plan of action for the Los Angeles police, wrote an op-ed for Mr. Bratton to lay out his vision for New York. Though it was never published, it included three elements of the approach now being employed: precision in going after the people, places and things driving crime; strategies for preventing crime and the evolving threat of terrorism; and neighborhood policing, with officers assigned to small areas to address local concerns of crime and disorder.\par \par \uc2 But critics contend that Mr. Bratton is an imperfect vessel for reform, too wedded to an approach that has channeled minority men into the criminal justice system.\par \par \uc2 For example, under Mr. Bratton in the 1990s, officers targeted those carrying open containers of beer -- a petty offense -- in order to find illicit drugs and guns. ''Your open beer lets me check your I.D.,'' Jack Maple, Mr. Bratton's crime strategist, said in a 1996 interview. (Mr. Maple died in 2001.) ''Maybe I bump against that bulge in your belt; with probable cause, I can frisk you.''\par \par \uc2 Open-container arrests and summonses soared, and the effects lingered.\par \par \uc2 Indeed, the approach has become emblematic of over-policing in New York, imposing a criminal record on many black and Hispanic men who otherwise would not have had one. This year, the City Council passed legislation creating a civil option for police to reduce the impact of some minor offenses, but Mr. Bratton successfully lobbied to keep arrest powers, frustrating some reform advocates.\par \par \uc2 Some have assailed Mr. Bratton's effort to add officers to the department, wondering if the low crime levels call instead for fewer officers. And despite efforts to increase the number of black recruits, the percentage of African-Americans in the department has decreased slightly since January 2014, to just over 15 percent. (Hispanics make up a growing portion, now roughly 27 percent.)\par \par \uc2 Ms. Wells Handy said one recruiting roadblock was that many black officers were not eager to encourage relatives to join, a contrast with other ethnic and racial groups, because of the ''struggle between black and blue.''\par \par \uc2 Norman Siegel, the former director of the New York Civil Liberties Union, said that after two and a half years of Mr. Bratton's leadership, ''a deep distrust along racial lines'' remained.\par \par \uc2 After the 2014 death of Mr. Garner, the protests that followed, and the killing of Officers Rafael Ramos and Wenjian Liu that December, Mr. Bratton began speaking again of a ''peace dividend.'' That talk served two purposes: to demonstrate a commitment to lowering the numbers of arrests and summonses, and to put in a favorable light the steep decline in those figures that came after a work slowdown.\par \par \uc2 The decline in arrests and summonses is now highlighted by police officials as a positive sign of the department's efforts to improve police-community relations, with no adverse effect on overall crime: Shootings through June were down to the lowest level for any six-month period in history; murders were also down more than 7 percent compared with last year's lows.\par \par \uc2 But for Mr. Siegel, the ''peace dividend'' has also been ''an admission that there was a war going on.''\par \par \uc2 'In Uncharted Waters'\par \par \uc2 ''We're in uncharted waters here, at this particular point in time in American policing,'' Mr. Bratton said on a Sunday morning \uc2 CBS News\uc2  program after three Baton Rouge officers were killed by a black gunman who, officials said, explicitly targeted officers.\par \par \uc2 Across the country, officers have been newly on guard.\par \par \uc2 In New York, Mr. Bratton's policing reforms were paired with the most significant militarization of the city's officers in its history -- changes, aimed at combating terrorism, that began last year. Hundreds of new specialized officers were outfitted with body armor and assault rifles. At the same time, others were added to precincts to buttress the neighborhood policing plan.\par \par \uc2 These two tracks in New York reflect the goals of many American police departments today: arming up for any eventuality, anywhere in the city (an active shooter, a coordinated terror attack), while, at the local level, toning down the everyday encounters between officers and civilians.\par \par \uc2 ''His essence is to read the horizon,'' \uc2 Chuck Wexler\uc2 , the head of the \uc2 Police Executive Research Forum\uc2 , a nonprofit group, said of Mr. Bratton.\par \par \uc2 Aides praise Mr. Bratton's flexibility, his willingness to revisit an approach to tailor it to the times. But he can also be rigid and prone to doubling down on provocative public statements.\par \par \uc2 That has caused some grumbling at City Hall, where aides to Mr. de Blasio have watched Mr. Bratton attract unwelcome press -- denigrating rap artists, linking marijuana and violence, accusing Black Lives Matter protesters of bigotry for their broad-brush approach to police.\par \par \uc2 And for all the talk of the unique role the police can play in healing old racial tensions, Mr. Bratton is frank that officers cannot do it alone. He said on Thursday that the department was ''struggling, struggling,'' with how to teach its officers about their ''implicit bias,'' the often subconscious racial baggage they may carry.\par \par \uc2 ''It's very difficult,'' he said. The ultimate goal is to open officers' minds to others' perspectives, Mr. Bratton said. ''That includes opening up my own mind.''\par \par \uc2 He is counting on the neighborhood policing plan to take hold and improve police-community relations. Under the leadership of Chief James P. O'Neill, the department's highest-ranking uniformed officer and a possible successor to Mr. Bratton, the program is being expanded across the city. Among the smaller changes aimed at making police precincts more welcoming: Six have added A.T.M.s for officers and the community to share.\par \par \uc2 But even though the program has been in place for a year in some neighborhoods, the department has no data yet, other than crime statistics and anecdotal reports, on whether it is working. (Mr. Bratton said the department would soon begin regular polling, ''down to the block level,'' to gauge community support.)\par \par \uc2 Whether the experiment -- to maintain declines in crime, improve community relations and keep officers safe -- will ultimately succeed is an open question. ''We're not there yet, because we're still undoing damage,'' Ms. Wells Handy said. ''We're building the plane while we're flying it.''\par \par \uc2 It is also an open question whether the effort will outlast Mr. Bratton's leadership.\par \par \uc2 William Andrews, who like Mr. Linder came from the \uc2 Metropolitan Transportation Authority\uc2 's marketing department and is one of Mr. Bratton's advisers, said the last time Mr. Bratton changed the culture of the Police Department, in the 1990s, it reverted to its old form soon after he left. ''You could feel the whole place just freezing up,'' Mr. Andrews said.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Bratton said in the interview on Thursday that he had created a ''line of succession'' that he was confident would ensure the longevity of the changes he was making.\par \par \uc2 As for Sweet Alice Harris, the Los Angeles activist, she recalled many conversations with Mr. Bratton, though not the ''see each other'' phrase he had absorbed. Nor had she heard him invoke her on national television. In an interview, Ms. Harris, 82, referred to Mr. Bratton as her son.\par \par \uc2 ''When you see my son, tell him Mama said, 'Keep on doing good,''' she said. ''Because I am going to keep working in the community, and he has to keep working on the police. We are going to change this thing.''\par \par \uc2 Below, William J.

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 CORRECTION APPENDEDPHILADELPHIA -- The prime-time lineup for Night 1 of the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia was full of political star power: the first lady, \uc2 Michelle Obama\uc2 ; Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, and Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont all addressed the crowd, and speeches were given by athletes, activists and celebrities.\par \par \uc2 Here are the highlights::\par \par \uc2 In an emotional finale to his campaign, Mr. Sanders was greeted with a standing ovation and was frequently interrupted by thunderous applause. Speaking directly to his supporters -- many of whom were in the hall as delegates -- he sympathized with their disappointment and urged them to take ''enormous pride'' in what they had started. But, he said, the time had come.\par \par \uc2 ''By these measures, any objective observer will conclude that -- based on her ideas and her leadership -- \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  must become the next president of the United States,'' Mr. Sanders said several minutes into his remarks. ''The choice is not even close.''\par \par \uc2 _____\par \par \uc2 In one of the night's most anticipated addresses, Mrs. Obama framed the \uc2 election\uc2  in terms of America's children, including her own. In a veiled knock at \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , she described how she and President Obama urged their own daughters ''to ignore those who question their father's citizenship or faith.''\par \par \uc2 Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , on the other hand, would show America's children for four or eight years ''that everyone in this country matters,'' Mrs. Obama said in a speech that drew immediate praise.\par \par \uc2 _____\par \par \uc2 Ms. Warren, speaking near the end of the program, delivered a fiery, populist appeal for Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , even as some in the arena who were disdainful of her endorsement chanted, ''We trusted you. We trusted you.'' Painting Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  as the product and protector of a ''rigged system,'' she said that Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  would fight against the hallmarks of that system: big banks and those who profit from student debt. ''\uc2 Trump\uc2 's entire campaign,'' Ms. Warren said, ''is just one more late-night \uc2 Trump\uc2  infomercial.''\par \par \uc2 _____\par \par \uc2 Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  may not have picked Senator \uc2 Cory Booker\uc2  of New Jersey as her running mate, but he still gave his best attack dog performance. Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , he said, seems to think that America is ''a zero-sum nation,'' and he concluded with a common refrain: ''In America, love always trumps hate.''\par \par \uc2 _____\par \par \uc2 Sarah Silverman, a comedian and supporter of Mr. Sanders, had a message for his most ardent fans: ''To the Bernie or bust people, let me just tell you, you're being ridiculous.''\par \par \uc2 Her words were met with raucous applause, as was her declaration that she would ''proudly vote'' for Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 . Mr. Sanders, she said, showed his supporters ''what is possible and what we deserve,'' but now the best way to honor his movement is by voting for Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 ''For the last year, I've been feeling the Bern,'' she joked. ''Relax, I put some cream on it.''\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  has trotted out a number of endorsements from professional athletes. On Monday, Jason Collins, the first N.B.A. player to come out as gay, and his brother and fellow N.B.A. player, Jarron Collins, gave Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  their support.\par \par \uc2 The Clintons, Jason Collins said, ''knew that my sexual orientation made no difference in my ability to play basketball, just as someone's gender makes no difference in his or her ability to lead our nation.''\par \par \uc2 Jarron Collins warned of the example Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  would set for his own children, whose mother is Mexican-American. ''When it comes to \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2 ,'' he said ''how do you tell your kids not to be a bully if their president is one?''\par \par \uc2 _____\par \par \uc2 ''I'm Al Franken, Minnesotan, senator and world renowned expert on right-wing megalomaniacs: Rush Limbaugh, Bill O'Reilly, and now, \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2 ,'' said Senator Al Franken of Minnesota, deadpanning, before launching into a spoof of Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  that recalled his work on Saturday Night Live.\par \par \uc2 Calling himself ''a proud alum of \uc2 Trump\uc2  U.,'' Mr. Franken lampooned the \uc2 Trump\uc2  educational program, its offerings and its fees. (''Ten percent higher'' for students, he joked.)\par \par \uc2 _____\par \par \uc2 Senator Kirsten Gillibrand of New York, who was Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's successor in the Senate, zeroed in on the struggles of working parents. As she ticked through Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's record on issues like paid family leave, affordable child care, and women's pay, she said that no other candidate would put ''families first'' as Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  would, or update the nation's laws as she would to reflect those priorities.\par \par \uc2 Find out what you need to know about the 2016 presidential race today, and get politics news updates via \uc2 Facebook\uc2 , \uc2 Twitter\uc2  and the First Draft newsletter.\par \par \uc2 Online Correction: July 26, 2016, Tuesday\par \par \uc2 This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An earlier version of this article misspelled the given name of a senator from New York.

SANGER; Amy Chozick contributed reporting from Philadelphia. \par \uc2 1,103 \uc2 words\par \uc2 26 July 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 14\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 WASHINGTON -- The F.B.I. investigation into the suspected state-sponsored Russian theft of emails and documents from the \uc2 Democratic National Committee\uc2 's computer networks has expanded to determine if aides and organizations considered close to \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  were also attacked, according to federal officials involved in the investigation.\par \par \uc2 But so far, a sampling of senior \uc2 Clinton\uc2  aides at the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia found none who said they had been notified by the F.B.I. or private investigators that their private emails had been compromised. At this point, law enforcement officials say, there is evidence only of attempts to gain access to those associates through ''spear-phishing'' attacks, often crude efforts to get someone to click on an email that releases malware into the computer.\par \par \uc2 The committee has said that Russia hacked into its computers and has been supported in its assertion by several private cybersecurity firms, including Crowdstrike, the company that investigated the committee's breach.\par \par \uc2 Two years ago, several \uc2 Clinton\uc2  aides who had worked at the State Department were notified that their accounts there had been broken into by one of the same Russian intelligence agencies, the Federal Security Service, or F.S.B., suspected of getting into the committee's system. That hacking, which went largely undetected while Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  was secretary of state in President Obama's first term, gave the Russian intelligence services what one diplomat termed a road map of Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's associates and frequent email partners.\par \par \uc2 Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's private server while she was secretary of state, in Chappaqua, N.Y., would have been another obvious target. But last month the F.B.I. director, James B. Comey, said there was no ''direct evidence'' that Russia or any other power had ''successfully hacked'' into Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's server. Still, he said, there was evidence that intruders had tried, and when Mr. Comey said any successful intruders were probably far too skilled to leave evidence of their intrusion behind, law enforcement officials said, he had the Russians in mind.\par \par \uc2 For years American intelligence agencies and the F.B.I. have tracked the operations here of two of the most sophisticated state-run hacking groups in the world, the G.R.U., Russia's military intelligence agency, and the F.S.B., the state security service and successor, twice removed, of the K.G.B. of the Soviet era.\par \par \uc2 The activities of the two groups in the United States and around the world have been tracked for so many decades that their successes and misadventures are the subject of movies and lore in both the United States and Russia. But since they turned to hacking techniques and sometimes cyberweaponry, the Obama administration has rarely protested in public about the group's boldest information-warfare attacks, in part to avoid retaliation.\par \par \uc2 The administration decided not to publicly identify the Russians as the power behind State Department, White House and Joint Chiefs of Staff intrusions. James R. Clapper Jr., the director of national intelligence, told Congress that the United States would not name or shame any country engaged in ordinary espionage -- of the kind the United States also does -- but should focus instead on setting norms against the theft of intellectual property and destructive attacks. For that reason, Mr. Obama has focused on agreements with China to protect corporate secrets.\par \par \uc2 Now some administration officials think they may have misunderstood Russia's intentions. After the public release of the emails and documents that brought down the chairwoman of the Democratic Party, \uc2 Debbie Wasserman Schultz\uc2 , and the threat by \uc2 WikiLeaks\uc2  to release more documents from this and other hacks, administration officials say they are in a strange new world in which Russia may be using the products of espionage to influence an American \uc2 election\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Some outsiders agree. ''There is nothing new in one nation's intelligence services using stealthy techniques to influence an \uc2 election\uc2  in another,'' Jack Goldsmith, a professor at Harvard Law School, wrote on the Lawfare blog on Monday. He noted that the United States had engaged in covert actions to influence elections in Indonesia, Italy, Chile and Poland during the Cold War.\par \par \uc2 But he added that ''doing so by hacking into a political party's computers and releasing their emails does seem somewhat new.'' It could foretell an era of data manipulation, in which outsiders could tinker with votes, or voter data, or ''lose'' electronic ballots.\par \par \uc2 Federal officials say their investigation has been underway since the spring, when the committee notified the F.B.I. of the intrusion. The committee's suspicions were triggered by what appeared to be a relatively clumsy attack by the G.R.U. In the course of investigating that attack, the F.B.I. discovered an earlier, more sophisticated attack on the committee by the F.S.B., which is often in competition with the G.R.U.\par \par \uc2 But investigators say the committee was reluctant to cooperate deeply in the federal investigation, relying instead -- as many companies do -- on private investigators that they hired. The committee brought in Crowdstrike, which reported publicly in June that it had evidence that the hack began last summer.\par \par \uc2 Julian Assange, who founded \uc2 WikiLeaks\uc2 , argued to Richard Engel of NBC in an interview broadcast Monday that ''there is no proof of that whatsoever'' that Russia was behind the original hacking. ''We have not disclosed our source, and of course, this is a diversion that's being pushed by the \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  campaign.''\par \par \uc2 Mr. Assange also said another round of emails to be released would provide ''enough evidence'' to indict her, but her campaign manager, Robby Mook, said, ''He says a lot of things, so I'm not, I'm not going to pay attention to that.''\par \par \uc2 Many cybersecurity firms that have examined the evidence released by Crowdstrike say Russia appears to be the source. Thomas Rid, a cyberexpert and author of ''Rise of the Machines,'' noted in an article published on Vice's website that the intruders made several mistakes: ''One leaked document included hyperlink error messages in Cyrillic,'' because the documents had been edited with Russian language settings, and other ''metadata'' was consistent with ''identical fingerprints'' found in attacks on the German Parliament. The Germans named one of Russia's intelligence agencies as the attacker in that case.\par \par \uc2 James B. Comey, the F.B.I. director, has said there was no ''direct evidence'' of hacking into Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's email server.

\par\par \uc2 ABROAD IN AMERICA\par \uc2 Foreign Desk; SECT\par \b \uc2 Democrats Followed by Their Own Divisions to Philadelphia\b0\par\par\uc2 By DECLAN WALSH \par \uc2 1,246 \uc2 words\par \uc2 26 July 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 The New York Times on the Web\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 PHILADELPHIA -- My first sight of this week's Democratic convention had nothing to do with the party's nominee for president, \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 At a bus stop in Philadelphia on Sunday night I passed people clutching placards for Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's vanquished rival, Senator Bernie Sanders -- a sign of the bubbling passions that have animated every argument in this extraordinary \uc2 election\uc2  year.\par \par \uc2 By Monday morning, those passions had erupted into open divisions, even before the convention had officially started, when Mr. Sanders's supporters jeered and booed Representative \uc2 Debbie Wasserman Schultz\uc2 , the chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee who organized this convention and who has promised to resign.\par \par \uc2 It was not the start that Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  wanted. In the wake of last week's bitterly divided Republican convention in Cleveland, chuckling Democrats promised that their own meeting would be a paragon of party discipline and unity. ''I can tell you we're going to have a very different kind of convention,'' Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  told supporters on Monday.\par \par \uc2 But the publication of 20,000 \uc2 Democratic National Committee\uc2  emails by \uc2 WikiLeaks\uc2  this weekend provided a disastrous prelude to the convention. The emails revealed concerted efforts by senior party leaders, including Ms. Wasserman Schultz, to undermine Mr. Sanders's campaign, reopening the wounds from the primary contest.\par \par \uc2 Come Monday afternoon, Mr. Sanders's supporters amassed outside the convention hall, shouting, ''Hell no, D.N.C., we won't vote for Hillary!'' Inside, they booed at every mention of Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's name. And Ms. Wasserman Schultz had announced that she would not, as tradition dictates, strike the gavel to open the convention later that day.\par \par \uc2 It is a sign of the fevered change roiling American politics that the normally staid party conventions have become spectacles of confrontation and division where insurgent forces are on display, often to the dismay of traditional party leaders.\par \par \uc2 It started during last week's Republican convention, a four-day spectacle of red-meat, hard-core conservative politics in Cleveland where delegates openly clashed over the candidacy of the billionaire \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2 . On the final night, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  delivered a dystopian address that presented America as a fearful place, surrounded by darkness and besieged by enemies. The atmosphere in the hall was strange and electrifying, punctuated by chants of ''U-S-A!''\par \par \uc2 This is my first time covering a campaign in America, and a far cry from those I remember as a child in Ireland, where my father was active in local politics for Fianna Fail, then the governing party. At home, political reporting involved a tour of what was sardonically known as the ''chicken-and-chips circuit,'' named for the dominant catering choice at campaign events across the country.\par \par \uc2 In Cleveland, news organizations and tech firms rented out restaurants near the convention arena, providing open bars and free food to journalists, political operatives and corporate types. The \uc2 Washington Post\uc2 , \uc2 CNN\uc2  and \uc2 Twitter\uc2  had their own hospitality setups at restaurants on East Fourth Street, a pedestrian walkway thronged by people and hawkers selling campaign paraphernalia: T-shirts that read ''Hot Chicks for \uc2 Trump\uc2 ,'' and pins denigrating Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 The media circus also offered an irresistible opportunity for other Americans, of every persuasion, to push their own causes. In front of the NBC studio, which overlooked the street, people waving signs jostled for space, trying to edge into the shot during a live panel discussion. One evangelist held a sign that read ''REPENT: Fear him who has the power to cast you into hell'' while another yelled into a bullhorn. A mustachioed young man was promoting a T-shirt company. And a diminutive woman, standing on her tiptoes, held a sign warning of the dangers of something call gadolinium.\par \par \uc2 ''The world's watching,'' she said. ''I can't allow another person to die.''\par \par \uc2 It felt like more like street theater than politics. But the more salient issues of the American campaign were never far. The shooting of three police officers in Baton Rouge, La., on the eve of the Republican convention highlighted the heady mix of guns, race and policing that has played prominently in the presidential race.\par \par \uc2 In Philadelphia, America's wider malaise is playing big. Sanders supporters are overwhelmingly young and, like their \uc2 Trump\uc2  counterparts, angry at the traditional establishment of their party. The weekend email dump by \uc2 WikiLeaks\uc2  seemed to confirm their suspicions that the party establishment was allied against them.\par \par \uc2 The difference is that the Democrats hope to unite their warring factions by reaching for more optimistic notes. In a speech on Saturday, Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's running mate, Senator Tim Kaine, garnered some rave reviews for his sunny and measured tone.\par \par \uc2 Apart from chicken and chips (that's French fries to American readers), Ireland of the 1970s produced its own controversial political figure in the form of Charles J. Haughey, the leader of Fianna Fail. Mr. Haughey divided the Irish between those who saw him as a champion of the people, and those who viewed him as a self-enriching scoundrel. His lavish lifestyle -- including a yacht, a mansion on an island and money stashed in offshore tax havens -- was eventually exposed in the 1990s.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Haughey's wealth was a drop compared to Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's, who boasts that his financial success qualifies him to run the United States, and is unashamed -- and, thus far, politically undamaged -- by some of his more questionable business dealings. His only fear, it seems, is being out of the news for long, which raises the question of how he will manage during this week's Democratic convention.\par \par \uc2 The Cleveland convention, with its baying calls for Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  to be jailed and for the abnegation of civil rights movements, did Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  no harm. The latest poll published Sunday gives him a small ratings bump, and a modest one-point lead over Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 But pollsters and political veterans are skeptical he can maintain this advantage, and the efficacy of polls at this point in the campaign is questionable.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's support base -- less-educated white people -- is too narrow, the analysts say, and he faces too much opposition inside the Republican Party. In the heat of a hard-fought campaign, they argue, his improvised campaign will wilt under pressure from the well-oiled Democratic machine, which already enjoys majority support in key demographics: African-Americans, Hispanics, women and young people.\par \par \uc2 Last week Stuart Stevens, a Republican operative, likened Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's blustering confidence about his chances to that of a man who has jumped from a 100-story building. ''He's at floor 50, and he thinks he knows how to fly,'' Mr. Stevens said.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  has defied the experts many times before -- less than a year ago, one prominent expert gave him a 2 percent chance of capturing the Republican nomination. As he breaks and reinvents the political rules, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  seems to have shown that it doesn't matter what the experts say or what the story is -- what matters is being in the middle of it.\par \par \uc2 This week, as the Democrats ready themselves for an unprecedented presidential race, Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  will try to show that she is the best story in town.\par \par \uc2 Declan Walsh, the Cairo bureau chief, is covering the American political campaign as a foreign correspondent in much the same way he would cover an event overseas.

\par\par \b \uc2 Democrats Push to Quell Revolt\b0\par\par\uc2 By Colleen McCain Nelson and Rebecca Ballhaus   \par \uc2 1,098 \uc2 words\par \uc2 26 July 2016\par \uc2 The Wall Street Journal\par \uc2 J\par A1\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 PHILADELPHIA -- The leaders of the Democratic Party's progressive wing worked to unify a party divided after a day of turmoil, with Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders leading the effort to rally support Monday for \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's presidential candidacy amid continuing resistance from his own backers.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Sanders delivered an unequivocal endorsement of his former primary rival on the opening night of the Democratic National Convention, urging his supporters not to stay home in November.\par \par \uc2 "Any objective observer will conclude that -- based on her ideas and her leadership -- \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  must become the next president of the United States," he said.\par \par \uc2 As Democrats gathered in Philadelphia, Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  and Mr. Sanders joined ranks to try to quell a revolt within the party sparked by the release of hacked \uc2 Democratic National Committee\uc2  emails that showed officials proposing ways to undermine the Vermont senator's presidential bid.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Sanders made no mention of the controversy but acknowledged his delegates' frustration with the final results of the primary, "saying that no one is more disappointed than I am." But he added that Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  would be an outstanding president and "I am proud to stand with her here tonight."\par \par \uc2 His endorsement was a vital step in unifying a party still reeling from a protracted primary, but it remains to be seen if a full detente can be reached. Mr. Sanders spoke highly of President \uc2 Barack Obama\uc2 , Vice President \uc2 Joe Biden\uc2  and Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  but made no mention of Virginia Sen. Tim Kaine, the vice presidential pick who is deemed insufficiently liberal by some Sanders backers.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Sanders's speech produced sustained cheers from his supporters.\par \par \uc2 Before he addressed the convention delegates, first lady \uc2 Michelle Obama\uc2  and Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren joined in Monday's effort to bridge divisions within the party by making the case for Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's candidacy.\par \par \uc2 "This \uc2 election\uc2 , and every \uc2 election\uc2 , is about who will have the power to shape our children for the next four or eight years of our lives," Mrs. Obama said. "There is only one person whom I trust with that responsibility, only one person who I believe is truly qualified to be president of the United States, and that is our friend \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 ."\par \par \uc2 Ms. Warren, who is a leading voice of the party's liberal wing, described the presumptive Democratic nominee as "one of the smartest, toughest, most tenacious people on this planet," adding, "I'm with Hillary."\par \par \uc2 She castigated Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  for rooting "for an economic crash that costs millions of people their jobs, their homes, their life savings."\par \par \uc2 The convention got off to a rocky start Monday afternoon, with many delegates booing every mention of Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's name, even after Mr. Sanders's backers had collected their biggest prize: the resignation of DNC chairwoman \uc2 Debbie Wasserman Schultz\uc2  and her removal from any prime convention speaking slot.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Sanders sent a text message to his delegates imploring them to help present a united front, and the two camps merged their convention floor teams to coordinate their control of the delegates.\par \par \uc2 "I ask you as a personal courtesy to me to not engage in any kind of protest on the floor," he wrote. The efforts appeared to have some effect after the first few convention speakers were interrupted by screaming Sanders delegates.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Sanders, his progressive ally Ms. Warren, and his backers scored other victories with the adoption of the party's most left-leaning platform in modern times and by filling key prime-time speaking slots.\par \par \uc2 "In order to get Bernie's platform through, he's kind of had to play ball with the Democratic establishment," said Adam Woodhall, a 33-year-old delegate from Florida, said with resignation. "You have to look at it more as a sacrifice on the part of progressive people and the values they want to get through."\par \par \uc2 At a midday rally, some of Mr. Sanders' supporters booed him when he urged them to help elect Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , who will win the nomination when delegates vote on Tuesday.\par \par \uc2 As the anger stoked by the emails grew during the day, DNC officials, including incoming interim chairwoman \uc2 Donna Brazile\uc2 , issued a written apology to Mr. Sanders, his supporters and the Democratic Party "for the inexcusable remarks made over email," while vowing to ensure that this never happens again.\par \par \uc2 "These comments do not reflect the values of the DNC or our steadfast commitment to neutrality during the nominating process," the Democratic officials said in their statement. "The DNC does not -- and will not -- tolerate disrespectful language exhibited toward our candidates." Ms. Brazile said she would complete an investigation before making any decisions about whether others at the DNC should lose their jobs.\par \par \uc2 Clinton\uc2  spokesman Brian Fallon told reporters the campaign doesn't condone the content of the leaked emails, singling out as particularly egregious one message that questioned Mr. Sanders's religion and suggested casting the Vermont senator as an atheist. On Sunday, Mr. Sanders told \uc2 CNN\uc2  that he found that missive "outrageous" and said he wasn't an atheist.\par \par \uc2 Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  was hundreds of miles away from the simmering controversy Monday, campaigning in Charlotte while her team tried to ensure a successful convention. Addressing the \uc2 Veterans of Foreign Wars\uc2  national convention, she questioned Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's judgment on foreign policy while pledging to abide by advice from military leaders.\par \par \uc2 In Philadelphia, Democratic delegates approved a platform that Mr. Sanders helped shape, laying out a road map that continues the party's shift to the left. Mr. Sanders and his allies successfully pushed for a document that calls for a $15 minimum wage indexed to inflation, a pathway to legalize marijuana, more aggressive regulations on Wall Street firms and putting a price on carbon dioxide, methane and other greenhouse gases.\par \par \uc2 He tried and failed to convince the platform committee to include an outright rejection of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a sweeping trade agreement. Mr. Sanders, though, has said he is satisfied with the platform.\par \par \uc2 The convention rules committee also moved forward with plans for a commission charged with reducing the number of Democratic superdelegates, a move that Mr. Sanders celebrated. He has argued these party officials and Democratic elected officials have too much influence on the process.\par \par \uc2 At his midday rally, Mr. Sanders said the conclusion of his campaign doesn't signal the end of the political movement he launched. "Real politics is not necessarily sexy," he said.\par \par \uc2 ---\par \par \uc2 Laura Meckler and Siobhan Hughes contributed to this article.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=wjco20160726000121"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document J000000020160726ec7q0006l\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw272\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4080\pichgoal600

\par\par \b \uc2 The Democratic Convention: Russians Accused of Hacking DNC\b0\par\par\uc2 By Damian Paletta and Devlin Barrett   \par \uc2 450 \uc2 words\par \uc2 26 July 2016\par \uc2 The Wall Street Journal\par \uc2 J\par A4\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 WASHINGTON -- The theft and leak of embarrassing \uc2 Democratic National Committee\uc2  emails prompted Democratic allegations of involvement by the Russian government.\par \par \uc2 U.S. authorities said they were still investigating who perpetrated the hack, but cybersecurity experts said the email release resembled past examples of political interference that other countries have tied to Russia.\par \par \uc2 Russian officials have denied involvement in the DNC hack. U.S. national-security officials haven't drawn a conclusion in the matter but consider Russian intelligence the chief suspect, according to people familiar with the investigation.\par \par \uc2 Regardless of who is responsible, the release of the DNC emails created immediate political fallout with the resignation of Democratic Party chief \uc2 Debbie Wasserman Schultz\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Multiple Democrats alleged the Russian government stole the emails and provided them to \uc2 WikiLeaks\uc2  for publication in an effort to help Republican presidential nominee \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  win the November \uc2 election\uc2 , though they offered no proof. "I think that voters need to take a look at this," said Robby Mook, campaign manager for Democrat \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's campaign. "It's troubling if it's true."\par \par \uc2 Meanwhile, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  has attempted to take political advantage of the development. "She worked very hard to rig the system," Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  said at a Virginia campaign appearance, referring to Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's primary fight with Sen. Bernie Sanders. "Little did she know that China, Russia, one of our many, many 'friends' hacked the hell out of us."\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 election\uc2  could have a profound impact on U.S.-Russia relations at a time when the countries are at odds over the Syrian civil war and other foreign-policy issues.\par \par \uc2 Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  has described Russian President \uc2 Vladimir Putin\uc2  as a "bully" who needs to be stood up to. Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  has said that the U.S. needs to work more closely with Russia -- to help the U.S. disentangle itself from the Middle East -- and that the U.S. should rethink its alliance with members of the \uc2 North Atlantic Treaty Organization\uc2 , a group that has traditionally stood as a deterrent to Russian interventions.\par \par \uc2 White House spokesman \uc2 Josh Earnest\uc2  said he couldn't verify the results of investigations by private firms and said the \uc2 Federal Bureau of Investigation\uc2  would determine whether to make the results of its investigation public.\par \par \uc2 Russian hackers have long targeted U.S. political entities and policy groups, including political parties and senior elected officials, according to U.S. officials. Alarming to some U.S. officials is the possibility that the DNC hack shows the Russians may be getting more aggressive and attempting to sway the U.S. political process.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=wjco20160726000118"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document J000000020160726ec7q0006i\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw272\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4080\pichgoal600

\par\par \b \uc2 The Democratic Convention --- CAPITAL JOURNAL: Democrats Face a Dilemma in Philadelphia\b0\par\par\uc2 By Gerald F. Seib   \par \uc2 792 \uc2 words\par \uc2 26 July 2016\par \uc2 The Wall Street Journal\par \uc2 J\par A4\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 Philadelphia -- Democrats who have gathered here for their national convention want people to vote for \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 . They also want people to vote against \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Which do they want more? That question represents a fundamental strategic choice the party and its nominee face as they frame their week in Philadelphia, to say nothing of the 15 weeks before \uc2 Election\uc2  Day.\par \par \uc2 Sadly for those in search of uplift, this is a year of a sour and angry electorate in which getting people to vote against the other candidate may seem easier. So the temptation for Democrats will be to make this campaign all about voting against \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  -- particularly after Monday's messy convention opening showed the party's Bernie Sanders faction isn't united behind Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Yet an anti-\uc2 Trump\uc2  focus also would be risky for Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 . Her greater need this week may be to provide voters a simple, concise and memorable explanation of why people should vote FOR her -- something Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  has done masterfully.\par \par \uc2 It's true that Republicans spent a lot of time at their convention last week trying to persuade Americans to vote against Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  -- more, in fact, than they spent trying to make the case to vote for Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 . The cries of "lock her up" rising nightly from the convention floor were an apt illustration.\par \par \uc2 The impulse was understandable. Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's personal approval ratings may make him a tough sell with many voters, but Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  is an equally inviting target for attack.\par \par \uc2 She has been a national figure for 25 years, and a controversial one much of that time. She inspires great loyalty among many, but deep loathing among others.\par \par \uc2 One political theory says that voters who haven't yet decided on an incumbent politician this well known actually may be leaning toward voting against that person.\par \par \uc2 Republicans tried to push those leaners all the way against Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  last week, and apparently with some success. A new CNN/ORC poll released Monday shows Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  moving into a national lead.\par \par \uc2 Republican pollster \uc2 Frank Luntz\uc2  tracked throughout the Republican convention week a group of undecided voters and concluded afterward: "Everyone except one said their attitude toward \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  was worse after." In short, Republicans did a fine job of making the case against \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 So why shouldn't Democrats simply return the favor? To some extent they will. Much as a television commercial the \uc2 Clinton\uc2  camp has been airing effectively reminds voters of some of Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's cruder moments, so too will the convention program this week.\par \par \uc2 Yet there is also reason to believe that if this \uc2 election\uc2  devolves into a downward spiral of negativity, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  has an advantage: It is hard to out-insult \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2 . \uc2 Sen. Marco Rubio\uc2  of Florida tried that in the GOP primary, and ended up flat on his back as a result.\par \par \uc2 But there is a more important reason. Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's supporters seem willing to look beyond the personality traits they don't like because they believe he has made a simple and compelling case for his candidacy: I will make America great again, build a wall to stop immigrants, block Muslims from suspect countries and tear up bad trade deals. To that riff he has now added: I am the law-and-order candidate.\par \par \uc2 In conversations with \uc2 Trump\uc2  backers, many seek to rationalize their support for him despite misgivings about his personality, simply because they find this message resonant in 2016.\par \par \uc2 It may be harder for Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  to get people to look past their doubts about her without some similarly compelling case for her candidacy. There are many policy positions, but what is that case in a nutshell?\par \par \uc2 Abruising primary fight and tensions with her own party's left wing have left Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  in a message muddle. Is the case for her a Bernie Sanders-like populist message of higher minimum wage, cost-free college and Wall Street bashing, or a centrist one of reassuring experience and the ability to work with Republicans and the business community to get things done?\par \par \uc2 Democratic leaders in Philadelphia suggest it will be a bit of both. They say they want the message to be that Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  can make the economy work for everyone, not just the wealthy Trumps of the world; that she knows the world well enough to ensure security; and that she can "bring people together."\par \par \uc2 The convention's program suggests that much effort also will go toward personalizing Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 ; a higher priority, perhaps, may be making a clearer case for her candidacy.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=wjco20160726000117"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License
