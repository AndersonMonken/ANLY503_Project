\par\par \b \uc2 Election\uc2  2016: Conservatives Praise Pence's Tone\b0\par\par\uc2 By Aaron Zitner   \par \uc2 363 \uc2 words\par \uc2 5 October 2016\par \uc2 The Wall Street Journal\par \uc2 J\par A4\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 Gov. Mike Pence\uc2  pleased fellow conservatives by using Tuesday's vice presidential debate to lay out what many of them called a fuller version of their views than the one commonly heard from presidential nominee \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Mr. Pence distilled the Republican economic message into just a few words, promising to boost the economy but lowering taxes, repealing the Affordable Care Act and repealing executive orders and regulations. Those ideas are GOP orthodoxy, and Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  has built much of his campaign around them. But Mr. Pence was more expansive in describing them.\par \par \uc2 He also talked about his opposition to abortion rights and support for the "sanctity of life," saying Democratic nominee \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  supports federal funding for abortion and late-term procedures. Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  opposes abortion rights, but he once supported them, and he discusses the issue infrequently on the campaign trail.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Pence pursued several lines of attack on Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  that many conservatives wished Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  had employed during the first presidential debate, such as noting that her family foundation accepted foreign donations while she supervised U.S. relations with foreign nations.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Pence took a tough tone on Russia, calling Russian President \uc2 Vladimir Putin\uc2  "small and bullying" and saying his nation should be confronted with force. Those comments contrasted with Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's praise for Mr. Putin's leadership skills.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Pence parried efforts to draw him into defending Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's demeanor and past statements, in contrast to how Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  handled himself in the first debate.\par \par \uc2 Some conservative commentators said they saw differences between Mr. Pence and the candidate at the top of the ticket. Others praised Mr. Pence both for his message and for the tempered way he delivered it. "Pence has convinced me conservatives should not write him off for 2020 just by being \uc2 Trump\uc2 's VP nominee," Erick Erickson, a prominent writer and critic of Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , said on \uc2 Twitter\uc2 . "He was solid."\par \par \uc2 Mr. Pence, an evangelical Christian, spoke in personal terms about his religious beliefs, another contrast with Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , who rarely speaks about faith.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=wjco20161005000130"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document J000000020161005eca500066\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw272\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4080\pichgoal600

\par\par \b \uc2 Election\uc2  2016: GOP Seizes on \uc2 Bill \uc2 Clinton\uc2  Comments\b0\par\par\uc2 By Stephanie Armour   \par \uc2 386 \uc2 words\par \uc2 5 October 2016\par \uc2 The Wall Street Journal\par \uc2 J\par A5\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 Republicans on Tuesday jumped on \uc2 Bill \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's reference to some of the gaps in the U.S. health system as an acknowledgment of shortcomings in the Affordable Care Act.\par \par \uc2 The former president and husband of Democratic presidential nominee \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  was speaking in Flint, Mich., on Monday, when he noted that while the current system works fine for lower-income people, and while 25 million more people now have health coverage, others are seeing their premiums doubled and coverage cut in half.\par \par \uc2 "The people that are getting killed in this deal are small businesspeople and individuals who make just a little too much to get any of these subsidies," he said. "Why? Because they're not organized, they don't have any bargaining power with insurance companies, and they're getting whacked."\par \par \uc2 He later said: "It's the craziest thing in the world."\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  then argued in favor of his wife's position that more Americans who don't qualify for subsidies be allowed to buy into Medicare and Medicaid to get coverage.\par \par \uc2 One major criticism of the 2010 law has been a marked rise in premiums for 2017. Individuals can buy their insurance on the individual market as well as on the ACA's exchanges. Those who are eligible for subsidies can only get them on the ACA's exchanges. The subsidies help offset the cost of the higher premiums.\par \par \uc2 That leads to a situation where millions of people will pay more for coverage next year, while those who qualify for subsidies will largely have their premium increases absorbed by the subsidies.\par \par \uc2 "President \uc2 Clinton\uc2  spoke about the importance of the Affordable Care Act and the good it has done to expand coverage for millions of Americans," Angel Urena, a spokesman for Mr. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , said in a statement. On Tuesday, Mr. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  reaffirmed his support for the law.\par \par \uc2 In Tuesday's vice-presidential debate, Republican \uc2 Mike Pence\uc2  brought up Mr. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's comments, and presidential nominee \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  mocked the comments earlier in the day. "Can you imagine what he went through after making that statement?" Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  said at a rally Tuesday.\par \par \uc2 Democrats have been saying the law has problems that should be addressed.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=wjco20161005000128"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document J000000020161005eca500064\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw272\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4080\pichgoal600

\par\par \b \uc2 Election\uc2  2016: Undecided Voters Say They Remain So\b0\par\par\uc2 By Scott Calvert, Will Connors and Valerie Bauerlein   \par \uc2 662 \uc2 words\par \uc2 5 October 2016\par \uc2 The Wall Street Journal\par \uc2 J\par A4\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 Eddie Sykes hoped Republican \uc2 Mike Pence\uc2  and Democrat Tim Kaine might help him decide how to vote for president in November.\par \par \uc2 But Mr. Sykes, a retired federal corrections officer in Woodbridge, Va., who has crossed party lines several times over the years, said Tuesday's vice-presidential debate in Farmville, Va., was no more clarifying than last week's presidential debate. "It's back to name-calling," he said. "I'm disappointed. I'm disgusted, really."\par \par \uc2 Other undecided voters in the swing state of Virginia said they didn't find a compelling reason to pick a presidential candidate after listening to Mr. Pence, Indiana's 57-year-old governor and \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2 's running mate, and Mr. Kaine, a 58-year-old senator from Virginia who is running with \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Debbie Ritenour, a 58-year-old retired teacher from Woodbridge, Va., typically votes Republican but doesn't know whether she will vote for Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  or Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 . Neither has "verbalized what they will do for this country, both domestic and international," she said.\par \par \uc2 She said Tuesday's debate at \uc2 Longwood University\uc2  didn't help her decide, even though she thought it was more substantive than last week's presidential debate. "It's a hard call," she said. "I'm anxious to hear the other two presidential debates."\par \par \uc2 Alba Cheverez, a 49-year-old sales administrator from Fairfax, Va., who leans Democratic, said she recently decided to vote for Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  after going back and forth between her and Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  over the summer.\par \par \uc2 A self-described social liberal and fiscal conservative, Ms. Cheverez said she heard nothing during Tuesday's debate to change her position. She said she didn't think Mr. Pence gave satisfactory answers to questions about Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's views on privatizing Social Security or recent revelations about the GOP nominee's 1995 tax return.\par \par \uc2 But she also criticized Mr. Kaine's frequent interruptions. "He's coming on a little too strong and not giving Pence an opportunity to answer questions I want answers to," she said midway through the debate.\par \par \uc2 Melissa Beaudoin, a GOP neighborhood team leader in Fairfax, Va., watched the debate with 50 other \uc2 Trump\uc2 -Pence supporters at the French Quarter Brasserie. She said Mr. Pence seemed centered, while Mr. Kaine seemed prone to attack.\par \par \uc2 Ms. Beaudoin said her husband was a small-business owner, with several rental properties, and she was more comfortable with Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's use of the U.S. tax code than Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's use of a private email server as secretary of state. "When you have temporary losses, you can take several years to write them off," she said. "He followed the law, plain or simple."\par \par \uc2 "It might not be pleasant, but he acted within what was in the law. She acted outside the law," Ms. Beaudoin said.\par \par \uc2 Rida Khan, a 19-year-old \uc2 Virginia Commonwealth University\uc2  student, watched the debate at the \uc2 Baja Bean Co\uc2 . restaurant in Richmond, Va., where AARP sponsored a viewing party to engage young adults on Social Security.\par \par \uc2 A strong \uc2 Clinton\uc2  supporter, Ms. Khan praised Mr. Kaine's comments on race relations. "That's important to me as a woman of color and a young person," she said. She said she also felt Mr. Pence struggled when repeatedly asked by Mr. Kaine if he defended his running mate's more controversial statements.\par \par \uc2 Both candidates already are helping in their respective states. \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's selection of Mr. Kaine "absolutely" has been a key factor in her solid lead in his native Virginia said Larry Sabato, director of the University of Virginia's Center for Politics.\par \par \uc2 And while Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  was already well-positioned to carry Indiana, Mr. Pence's presence on the GOP ticket should widen Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's margin of victory by several percentage points, Mr. Sabato said.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=wjco20161005000127"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document J000000020161005eca500063\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw272\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4080\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 REVIEW & OUTLOOK (Editorial)\par \b \uc2 Trump\uc2 's Best Debate\b0\par\par\uc2 592 \uc2 words\par \uc2 5 October 2016\par \uc2 The Wall Street Journal\par \uc2 J\par A14\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 If \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  could make the case for \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  half as well as \uc2 Mike Pence\uc2  makes the case for \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2 , the New York businessman would be well on his way to the White House. That's our conclusion from Tuesday's vice presidential debate, in which the Indiana Governor made the sustained case against the Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 -Barack Obama status quo in Washington that Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  should have made last week.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Pence is a former radio talk show host, and it showed with his cool, articulate delivery. His earnest, low-key demeanor was a notable contrast to Tim Kaine, whose strategy seemed to be to interrupt Mr. Pence at every opportunity. Perhaps the Virginia Senator studied \uc2 Joe Biden\uc2 's strategy from four years ago when the Vice President did the same against Paul Ryan, but Mr. Kaine is not a natural bully. Our guess is that his endless interruptions grated on millions of viewers.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Kaine's marching orders clearly were to absorb the \uc2 Clinton\uc2  campaign's opposition research file on Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , keep repeating it, and dare Mr. Pence to defend it. The point seemed to be to remind Americans that Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  can be crude, nasty and untutored. This fits the \uc2 Clinton\uc2  campaign strategy to delegitimize Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  personally as a potential President. His affirmative case for Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  and her agenda were almost afterthoughts.\par \par \uc2 For the most part Mr. Pence dodged this trap, going back on offense against the \uc2 Clinton\uc2 -Obama record rather than defend every \uc2 Trump\uc2  statement, many of which are indefensible. This is a useful lesson for Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  to take into the next debate on Sunday night, a town hall in which audience members will ask the questions. People want to like their Presidents.\par \par \uc2 The most notable substantive exchanges occurred on foreign policy, with Mr. Pence offering a detailed critique of Mr. Obama's record and growing global disorder. Mr. Kaine kept saying that \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  was part of the team that killed Osama bin Laden, but that is old antiterror news. Mr. Pence replied that the main terror threat now is Islamic State, which he rightly said grew out of "the vacuum" left when President Obama withdrew all U.S. troops from Iraq.\par \par \uc2 Also notable was the debate on Russia, with Mr. Kaine claiming that Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  has business ties with "oligarchs" that cause him to apologize for \uc2 Vladimir Putin\uc2 . Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's admiration for Mr. Putin is mysterious and worrisome. But Mr. Pence pointed out that Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's hawkishness-come-lately on Russia follows years of weak policy that invited Mr. Putin's aggression. Mr. Pence reminded the audience what a classic Republican security policy sounds like -- if only Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  would adopt it.\par \par \uc2 Vice presidential debates don't typically change the course of an \uc2 election\uc2 , but this one could be different if Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  heeds its lessons in his next debate. The Republican has slid in the polls since the first debate by getting lost in dead-end issues and self-indulgent \uc2 Twitter\uc2  bursts. If this is the \uc2 Trump\uc2  who shows up on Sunday, he will validate the Kaine critique and the \uc2 election\uc2  will essentially be over.\par \par \uc2 The alternative is to follow the Pence template of doing your homework, sounding presidential, and making the case for change from the failures of the last seven years on the economy and security. If Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  wants to win, his running mate showed him the way.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=wjco20161005000124"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document J000000020161005eca500060\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw272\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4080\pichgoal600

\par\par \b \uc2 Election\uc2  2016: \uc2 Clinton\uc2  Foundation\uc2  Amends Its Previous Filing With New York\b0\par\par\uc2 By James V.

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 Officials at the foundation of Democratic presidential nominee \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  said they filed information Tuesday with the New York attorney general's office that was missing from previous disclosures.\par \par \uc2 The move comes a day after Republican rival \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2 's charitable foundation was told to suspend its fundraising in the state because it violated registration requirements.\par \par \uc2 A \uc2 Clinton\uc2  Foundation spokesman said the charity has complied with New York law, but amended its annual charitable filing with the office of Eric Schneiderman, a Democrat, "out of an abundance of caution." The group said it would disclose more detailed financial data on its affiliates.\par \par \uc2 A spokesman for Mr. Schneiderman said the foundation's filings for at least one year -- in 2012 -- were incomplete. After the foundation submitted the additional information on Tuesday, the attorney general's office made it public, showing a more complete breakdown of annual revenues, expenses and liabilities for the foundation and its related entities, including foreign affiliates.\par \par \uc2 The foundation's move comes as presidential contenders' philanthropic ventures have come under scrutiny.\par \par \uc2 Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's political rivals have questioned the \uc2 Clinton\uc2  Foundation\uc2 's acceptance of foreign government donations, including some that came during Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's tenure as secretary of state. Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  has said there were no conflicts of interest and said she is proud of the foundation.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Schneiderman's office said Monday it is demanding that Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's charitable foundation suspend fundraising activity in New York, issuing a cease-and-desist letter accusing Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's family nonprofit of failing to register as a charity that raises money in the state. The foundation has 15 days from Sept. 30 -- the day the notice was dated -- to correct its registration and file required paperwork.\par \par \uc2 A spokeswoman for Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  said the candidate questioned the political motives of Mr. Schneiderman, who supports Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , and said the foundation would comply with Mr. Schneiderman's broader investigation into the charity.\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 Clinton\uc2  Foundation\uc2  has offered to share more details with Mr. Schneiderman's bureau about contributions from foreign governments. But a spokesman for the foundation said it hasn't received a request to do so from Mr. Schneiderman's office.\par \par \uc2 New York requires that charitable organizations annually disclose and itemize the dollar amounts of grants made by a "government agency." The attorney general and the \uc2 Clinton\uc2  Foundation\uc2  said they are interpreting that rule to be limited to grants from domestic government sources.\par \par \uc2 The foundation in recent years has disclosed to New York officials its foreign government grants as a lump sum. The \uc2 Clinton\uc2  Health Access Initiative, the foundation's largest project, also makes annual financial disclosures to the attorney general, but neither itemizes its foreign government grants nor specifies a summary total dollar figure, a practice scrutinized in a Scripps News report from September.\par \par \uc2 "CHAI also received foreign government contributions and can provide those in more details if needed," the group told the attorney general's office in a letter accompanying its most recent annual filing.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=wjco20161005000123"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document J000000020161005eca50005z\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw272\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4080\pichgoal600

Bender   \par \uc2 479 \uc2 words\par \uc2 5 October 2016\par \uc2 The Wall Street Journal\par \uc2 J\par A6\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 PRESCOTT VALLEY, Ariz. -- Republican presidential nominee \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  blamed his Democratic opponent, \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , for a U.S. tax code that allowed him to declare a big loss and likely reduced or even eliminated his federal liability for years.\par \par \uc2 "Why didn't she ever try to change those laws so I couldn't use them?" Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  said Tuesday at a campaign rally here, referring to her time as a U.S. senator from New York from 2001 to 2009. "The reason that she did not do that is her donors and contributors have used those same tax laws as I did. The same way."\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's tax records that were disclosed over the weekend were from 1995, several years before Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  took office. Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  himself has been a \uc2 Clinton\uc2  donor. Since 2002, he has donated $4,700 to Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's Senate and presidential campaigns, according to \uc2 Federal \uc2 Election\uc2  Commission\uc2  filings, though he was ultimately refunded $4,000.\par \par \uc2 Five weeks from \uc2 election\uc2  day, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  returned to Arizona for the first time since a noted immigration speech in the state on Aug. 31. Although the state has been a conservative stronghold for Republican presidential candidates, a Wall Street Journal/NBC News/Marist poll in Arizona last month showed Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  with a lead of just 1 percentage point in the state.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  reminded the crowd of several thousand that he wanted to build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border, which drew applause and chants of "build the wall."\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  has spent several days trying to counter the unauthorized release of some of his tax records by acknowledging the unfairness of the U.S. tax code. He has cast himself as the only candidate in the race who understands the nuances of the complex laws.\par \par \uc2 During two rallies in Colorado on Monday, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  said he had a fiduciary responsibility to pay as little tax as possible. He acknowledged that it was unfair and vowed to make the tax code more balanced.\par \par \uc2 But in Arizona on Tuesday, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  mostly returned to his stump speech, promising to be a law-and-order president who would halt illegal immigration and reduce crime and poverty in America's major cities.\par \par \uc2 "I'm going to keep the terrorists the hell out of the country," Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  said on Tuesday.\par \par \uc2 Earlier in the day, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  held a private meeting with about a dozen energy executives in Denver, where he repeated complaints from the campaign trail that the industry is saddled with too many regulations.\par \par \uc2 "The energy business is being decimated," he said.\par \par \uc2 Trump\uc2  repeatedly criticized Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  during the meeting for what he said was her support of overregulation of the energy industry.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=wjco20161005000121"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document J000000020161005eca50005x\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw272\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4080\pichgoal600

\par\par \b \uc2 Election\uc2  2016: \uc2 Trump\uc2 's Buzz Tests \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's Organization\b0\par\par\uc2 By Monica Langley and Peter Nicholas   \par \uc2 882 \uc2 words\par \uc2 5 October 2016\par \uc2 The Wall Street Journal\par \uc2 J\par A6\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 DES MOINES, Iowa -- At a small dinner party recently, several supporters of \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  kept returning to a two-word phrase that represented their biggest fear -- enthusiasm gap.\par \par \uc2 That same day, her rival \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  spoke to a rally of 8,000 in Florida, according to local media reports. People waited in line for hours in the 95-degree heat for a glimpse of the Republican nominee in what by now has become a familiar pattern. On the trail, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  invariably is the bigger draw.\par \par \uc2 "I've never seen anything like this enthusiasm," said GOP vice-presidential nominee \uc2 Mike Pence\uc2 . "Everywhere I go, even I'm getting big crowds, and I'm not the main event."\par \par \uc2 Whether enthusiasm levels make a difference in the \uc2 election\uc2  is one of the key tests of the unpredictable 2016 presidential race. A campaign's organizational muscle can be crucial to converting the energy at a rally into something tangible --volunteers, donors, votes --and that is what the \uc2 Trump\uc2  campaign is seeking to do.\par \par \uc2 At the same time, even lukewarm \uc2 Clinton\uc2  voters may feel ample motivation to cast their ballots if their disdain for the Republican nominee runs deep enough, her allies say. And large crowds don't necessarily translate into votes. During the Democratic primaries, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders attracted far bigger audiences than Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  but lost handily.\par \par \uc2 At a \uc2 Clinton\uc2  rally in Des Moines last week, about 2,000 people showed up in a space that could hold another 1,000. But the \uc2 Clinton\uc2  forces sought to make the most of the turnout.\par \par \uc2 At the end of the event, campaign workers chanting "Vote! Vote!" coaxed supporters to walk the few blocks to a polling place and cast early ballots. About 110 people complied, locking in votes for Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  in an important battleground state.\par \par \uc2 "Having a lot of people going to your events doesn't do anything if you're not turning them into an army of people who will actually do the work to help you turn out voters," said Joel Benenson, a senior \uc2 Clinton\uc2  strategist and pollster.\par \par \uc2 Crowd size does show that ample numbers are excited enough to sign up online for tickets and wait in line to see a candidate. In a campaign in which Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's standing in polls has slipped of late, aides see his large crowds as a bright spot that could give him an edge on \uc2 Election\uc2  Day.\par \par \uc2 His campaign routinely sends out pictures pointing to the disparity in attendance at \uc2 Clinton\uc2  and \uc2 Trump\uc2  rallies. Aides say that once \uc2 Trump\uc2  rallies are advertised online, tickets are over-reserved by three times capacity within hours. At that point, the campaign stops offering tickets, which occasionally show up on \uc2 eBay\uc2  for a few hundred dollars apiece.\par \par \uc2 Tickets to \uc2 Clinton\uc2  rallies haven't proved to be such hot commodities, and some of her supportersconcede she's not an especially magnetic figure.\par \par \uc2 "I wish I could say that Hillary was exciting and engendered a great deal of enthusiasm," said David Bland, vice chairman of the Democratic Party in Wake County, N.C. "But that's not Hillary. It's not in her DNA."\par \par \uc2 Polling shows that core elements of the Democratic coalition aren't as fired up about the race as in past elections, although Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  is beginning to make up ground.\par \par \uc2 A CNN-ORC survey taken after the first presidential debate showed that, overall, Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  has cut into Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's advantage when it comes to voter enthusiasm.\par \par \uc2 Some 73% of \uc2 Trump\uc2  supporters said they feel at least some measure of enthusiasm about voting for president; for \uc2 Clinton\uc2  supporters, the figure was 70%.\par \par \uc2 Yet among voters between the ages of 18 and 34, a group that helped power President \uc2 Barack Obama\uc2 's two victories, only 51% said they felt enthusiastic. By contrast, 65% of white working class voters, a reliable part of Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's base, said they are enthusiastic about casting their vote.\par \par \uc2 Kristen Meyers, 26, was one of the people who came to hear Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  speak in Des Moines. She has been a slow convert, having backed Mr. Sanders in the primaries and Mr. Obama before that.\par \par \uc2 "Hillary just didn't have that spark when we were coming into voting," she said, although she now backs for the former secretary of state. "She's been in the spotlight for 30 years."\par \par \uc2 Wall Street Journal-NBC News surveys show that about 66% of African-American voters say they're "interested" in the race, meaning they're following and thinking about it. That is 17 points lower than at the same point in 2012, when Mr. Obama was running for re-\uc2 election\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 "I'm not hearing the enthusiasm [among African-American voters] that says: 'I can't wait to vote,' " said Al Sharpton, a civil rights leader.\par \par \uc2 Hoping to stoke more excitement, the \uc2 Clinton\uc2  campaign is dispatching an A-list roster of surrogates in the campaign's closing weeks. Mr. Sanders is set to campaign for her in Maineon Friday.\par \par \uc2 The president and first lady \uc2 Michelle Obama\uc2 , favorites of both young and African-American voters, also are keeping an aggressive campaign schedule.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=wjco20161005000120"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document J000000020161005eca50005w\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw272\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4080\pichgoal600

\par\par \b \uc2 World News: U.S. Seeks to Redraw Ties With Moscow --- Kerry holds out the possibility of working with Russia despite halting Syria talks\b0\par\par\uc2 By Felicia Schwartz   \par \uc2 562 \uc2 words\par \uc2 5 October 2016\par \uc2 The Wall Street Journal\par \uc2 J\par A8\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 The Obama administration has set about redrawing its relationship with Russia amid this week's diplomatic breakdown over Syria, taking on one of its most complex foreign-policy challenges just three months before a new president takes office.\par \par \uc2 Speaking in Brussels on Tuesday, Secretary of State \uc2 John Kerry\uc2  held out the possibility of once again working with Moscow after pulling out of talks over a Syrian cease-fire deal the day before.\par \par \uc2 While he faulted Russia for prolonging the war by tying its interests to the Assad regime and turning a blind eye to its brutality, his comments also underscored Moscow's influence in bringing any resolution to the conflict.\par \par \uc2 "Russia knows exactly what it needs to do to get that cessation implemented in a fair and reasonable way," Mr. Kerry said, as he urged Russia and the Assad regime to grant humanitarian access in Syria.\par \par \uc2 The move to formally walk away Monday from the cease-fire and military-cooperation agreement reached with Russia last month heightens pressure on Washington to spell out its next steps in Syria. But neither Mr. Kerry nor officials in Washington offered any new specifics Tuesday.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Kerry said the U.S. wanted Russian and Syrian warplanes out of the skies over Aleppo, but didn't lay out a plan to do so. U.S. officials also said that one option could involve U.S. strikes on Syrian forces, although they acknowledged such a move carried risks of escalating a confrontation with Russia and is unlikely.\par \par \uc2 Senior national-security officials will meet this week to weigh new options on Syria, officials said.\par \par \uc2 Arab officials this week voiced deep skepticism that the Obama administration would change course in Syria and engage in any stepped-up efforts to pressure the Assad regime. These officials said their governments have assumed the White House will hand Syria policy over to the next U.S. administration virtually unchanged from its current cautious approach.\par \par \uc2 "We're largely trying to calculate how \uc2 Clinton\uc2  or \uc2 Trump\uc2  will act on Syria," said a senior Arab official, referring to next month's U.S. \uc2 election\uc2 , which will elect either Democrat \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  or Republican \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  as the next American leader.\par \par \uc2 Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Tuesday that Moscow remained interested in improving relations with Washington, despite the discord over Syria, the news agency Interfax reported.\par \par \uc2 "Contact is continuing and will continue, because it is necessary in order to avoid dangerous incidents," he said, referring to a channel to avoid conflicts between the governments' operations in Syria.\par \par \uc2 With the Syrian talks ended, U.S. officials have said Washington is considering a range of options, including imposing new sanctions on Russia and providing more lethal weapons to CIA-vetted rebels.\par \par \uc2 Some have suggested carrying out military strikes on Assad-regime targets, though it seems unlikely President \uc2 Barack Obama\uc2  would support that. White House press secretary \uc2 Josh Earnest\uc2  said Mr. Obama wasn't taking any options off the table, but noted the risk with striking regime targets, particularly that doing so would push U.S. and Russian military forces closer toward confrontation.\par \par \uc2 ---\par \par \uc2 Julian E.

\par\par \uc2 REVIEW & OUTLOOK (Editorial)\par \b \uc2 The Schneiderman Rules\b0\par\par\uc2 782 \uc2 words\par \uc2 4 October 2016\par \uc2 The Wall Street Journal\par \uc2 J\par A12\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 Correction\par \par \uc2 Citizens United sued New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman to block his attempt to force donor disclosure. An Oct. 4 editorial, "The Schneiderman Rules," said Mr. Schneiderman had sued Citizens United.\par \par \uc2 (WSJ October 8, 2016)\par \par \uc2 (END)\par \par \uc2 We wrote Monday that many liberals believe that defeating \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  justifies anything, and right on time comes the egregious Eric Schneiderman. The New York Attorney General delivered his own personal October surprise for \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  by announcing a supposed scandal over Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's charitable foundation.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Schneiderman's office, in a letter sent Friday and released Monday, ordered the \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2  Foundation\uc2  to cease raising money in New York. According to the letter, the \uc2 Trump\uc2  outfit is not correctly registered in the state to solicit funds.\par \par \uc2 The AG gave the foundation 15 days to turn over reams of paper, including audited financial statements and annual financial reports going back many years. Mr. Schneiderman warned in his letter that failure to comply will be deemed a "fraud upon the people of the state of New York."\par \par \uc2 The announcement is Mr. Schneiderman's latest misuse of his prosecutorial authority to attack his political enemies. The AG's office first announced it was "investigating" Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  in mid-September -- the better to begin a round of bad headlines -- and has also been touting its inquiry into \uc2 Trump\uc2  University. While it's possible the \uc2 Trump\uc2  Foundation has violated in some way "section 172 of Article 7-A New York's Executive Law," it's notable that the best Mr. Schneiderman could drum up by way of "fraud" was a paperwork technicality.\par \par \uc2 The bigger point is timing. Mr. Schneiderman's cease-and-desist order, coming a month before a general \uc2 election\uc2 , smells like partisan politics. The AG has endorsed Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  and sits on the Democratic nominee's New York "leadership council," which the \uc2 Clinton\uc2  campaign describes as the "in-state leadership" for her campaign, charged with "amplifying the campaign's national voice to New York families" and "aiding the campaign with rapid response."\par \par \uc2 Mr. Schneiderman's prosecution of her opponent certainly qualifies as "rapid." He could easily have waited until Nov. 9 to divulge his investigation and unveil his order. If the \uc2 Trump\uc2  Foundation has been deficient with its paperwork for as long as the AG's office says, a few more weeks of delay would hardly hurt.\par \par \uc2 "To the public it will appear that Schneiderman acted not in the interest of his client, the State, but for whatever influence his announcement might have on the \uc2 election\uc2  outcome," NYU School of Law Professor Stephen Gillers told LawNewz.com, and Mr. Gillers is no conservative.\par \par \uc2 Witness how responsible prosecutors operate: In Florida, state attorney Mark Ober recently requested that Governor \uc2 Rick Scott\uc2  assign a different attorney to look into allegations that Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi was influenced by a \uc2 Trump\uc2  campaign donation. Mr. Ober noted that he had worked with Ms. Bondi for decades and viewed her as a "close personal friend," and that his oversight of the case would be a conflict of interest. Mr. Schneiderman isn't even feigning an interest in the neutral application of law.\par \par \uc2 There's also Mr. Schneiderman's screaming double standard. A September Scripps News investigation found that "year after year the [\uc2 Clinton\uc2  Foundation\uc2  and \uc2 Clinton\uc2  Health Access Initiative] have ignored New York law and related instructions" when it comes to revealing foreign donors. New York charity law requires nonprofits to divulge the name of each government "agency" (foreign or domestic) and "the amount of each contribution" each year. It found that Mr. Schneiderman has the power to force that disclosure but has refused to do so.\par \par \uc2 This abdication is especially notable given that Mr. Schneiderman has been on a tear to force conservative nonprofits to reveal their confidential lists of donors -- the better for the left to know whom to harass and target. The lawless AG has sued an outfit known as \uc2 Citizens United\uc2  to get its donor list, and in late August he convinced a federal judge to help him trammel that group's First Amendment rights. Mr. Schneiderman bragged, as usual, that this disclosure is protecting his state from "fraud and abuse."\par \par \uc2 New York citizens deserve to be protected from abuse -- of the prosecutorial kind that Mr. Schneiderman is exercising to swing an \uc2 election\uc2 . The irony is that Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's critics keep telling us that he must be defeated because he poses a unique threat to the U.S. Constitution and the rule of law. What about the abuses that Mr. Schneiderman is practicing now? Where's the liberal outrage?\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=wjco20161004000045"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document J000000020161004eca40001z\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 National Desk; SECTA\par \b \uc2 With Pence and Kaine, Faith Is Back in the Mix\b0\par\par\uc2 By JONATHAN MARTIN \par \uc2 1,379 \uc2 words\par \uc2 4 October 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 1\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 WASHINGTON -- The descent of the 2016 presidential campaign last week into the realm of sex tapes and marital infidelity was remarkable enough in its own right, but it also offered a reminder of what has been largely absent from the race: a debate about issues of public morality that for decades have been at the heart of the country's political divide.\par \par \uc2 In a striking departure from the recent history of White House campaigns, there has been almost no discussion of abortion or gay rights, two of the most animating issues for millions of American voters.\par \par \uc2 ''This is more about this year's candidates than it is about the country,'' said \uc2 Russell Moore\uc2 , the public face of the \uc2 Southern Baptist Convention\uc2 . ''I don't think America is as secular as this campaign would have you think.''\par \par \uc2 The country may get a reminder of that on Tuesday evening during the vice-presidential debate.\par \par \uc2 The two men who will face off, Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia and \uc2 Gov. Mike Pence\uc2  of Indiana, share a deep religious faith that is central to their politics, but has been obscured by a more profane than holy race on top of the ticket.\par \par \uc2 While both men are devout, they represent different strands of Christianity in American life, a contrast that is likely to be on display as they discuss their positions on social issues and how religious beliefs would guide their approach to governing.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Pence, who was raised Catholic, turned toward evangelical Christianity when he was in college and has made no secret of how cultural issues have shaped his politics. He was one of the most outspoken foes of abortion rights and same-sex marriage when he was in Congress. And as Indiana's governor, he became engulfed in controversy after he signed legislation allowing the state's business owners to deny services to gay, lesbian and transgender people for religious reasons.\par \par \uc2 But Mr. Pence, whose signature line is that he is ''a Christian, a conservative and a Republican -- in that order,'' finds himself in a campaign devoid of any debate about the moral questions that have for decades been central to the country's right-left political divide.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Kaine, who like Mr. Pence has Irish roots and was raised Catholic, had his faith forged when, during law school, he went to Honduras and served as a missionary for the Jesuits. It was there that he embraced a brand of liberation theology centered on social justice that would eventually be one of the forces propelling him into government.\par \par \uc2 Early in his political career, Mr. Kaine's style of Catholicism made him uneasy with some elements of the Democratic Party, particularly on issues like abortion rights and same-sex marriage. While he has since shifted on those issues to accommodate his party -- and his running mate -- he remains unapologetic about how important his faith is to his career in public service.\par \par \uc2 ''I've been very plain about my time in Honduras and about how important my own spiritual life is to me as my big motivator in this,'' Mr. Kaine said in an interview.\par \par \uc2 He said he had not encountered any discomfort from his party, which polls show to be increasingly secular, when he talks about his religious beliefs.\par \par \uc2 ''It doesn't divide you from people,'' he said. ''It actually connects you to people because they're skeptical about people in politics but curious about us, too, and if you share with them what motivates you, that gives them some understanding of who you are.''\par \par \uc2 But the openness with which the vice-presidential candidates discuss religion, and their focus on moral issues, have not been shared by their partners atop the ticket.\par \par \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , who has been married three times and boasted of his affairs, does not discuss matters of sexual morality, even when speaking to Christian conservatives. In a break from recent Republican nominees, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  did not mention abortion or even allude to the sanctity of life a single time in his marathon acceptance speech at this summer's Republican National Convention.\par \par \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  prefers to draw attention to Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's statements on race and gender, painting him as an outlier from his own party rather than, in the fashion of most Democratic presidential candidates, linking him to the Republican Party's hard-line social platform.\par \par \uc2 And some people of faith have been frustrated by the fact that the issues they have fought over for years are all but missing from the campaign. \uc2 Oran Smith\uc2 , who heads South Carolina's Palmetto \uc2 Family Council\uc2 , said he was reminded of the old line about Christian conservatives and the Republican Party: ''We're on the bus, we're just not driving the bus.''\par \par \uc2 He said this \uc2 election\uc2  demonstrated why evangelicals need to be more assertive in Republican politics, urging them to ''take over the party infrastructure,'' at least in early-voting Iowa and South Carolina.\par \par \uc2 For now, though, people of faith are choosing between two candidates uneasy discussing religion.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  has at times been unable to cite a single Bible verse, and he memorably referred to the second book of Corinthians as ''Two Corinthians,'' a sign of his unfamiliarity with Scripture. Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  is a Methodist and more grounded in the church, but she concedes that discussing her own faith does not ''come naturally.''\par \par \uc2 The candidates at the top of the ticket are not exactly ignoring faith-based voters, however. Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  is relying on black churchgoers, a key constituency in her primary victory earlier this year, and Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  has consolidated support among white evangelicals thanks to a determined courtship, a pledge to appoint conservative judges and their fear of four more years of a Democrat in the White House.\par \par \uc2 ''This is an easy \uc2 election\uc2 ,'' said \uc2 Jerry Falwell Jr\uc2 ., the president of Liberty University and one of Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's earliest evangelical supporters. ''If you're a pro-life Christian, you know \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  is going to appoint justices who are not pro-life.''\par \par \uc2 To other conservative Christians, though, the choice is more agonizing than easy.\par \par \uc2 ''Any way I look at this I lose,'' said Mr. Moore of the \uc2 Southern Baptist Convention\uc2 , comparing Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's social liberalism with what he called Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's ''\uc2 Howard Stern\uc2  conservatism.''\par \par \uc2 Evangelicals like Mr. Smith are troubled by Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's divorces, inflammatory language about gender and race and his lack of repentance in public. And among such voters there is uncertainty about whether, given his lack of a track record, they can trust Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's promises on judges and his vows to strip federal funding from \uc2 Planned Parenthood\uc2  and protect what conservatives call religious liberty.\par \par \uc2 That a number of leading evangelicals and so many in the rank-and-file lined up with Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  only points to how willing they are to toe the party line, Mr. Moore said. ''The Republican Party assumes it can count on conservative Christians no matter what,'' he said. ''And this \uc2 election\uc2  seems to be proving that theory right.''\par \par \uc2 Yet veterans of evangelical politics who have embraced Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  point to a body of evidence they say indicates he will fulfill his commitments to them after working relentlessly to win over Christian conservatives, speaking at their gatherings, inviting them to \uc2 Trump\uc2  Tower and seeking their counsel.\par \par \uc2 ''I can't think of a nominee of this party since Reagan in 1980 who has more aggressively courted the evangelical vote than \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2 ,'' said \uc2 Ralph Reed\uc2 , a longtime Republican consultant.\par \par \uc2 Wooing aside, though, many conservative evangelicals wish they simply had better options. Like the two gentlemanly Christians much of the country will see for the first time on Tuesday.\par \par \uc2 ''If we had a \uc2 Mike Pence\uc2  versus Tim Kaine race, it would be an \uc2 election\uc2  worthy of the American people,'' Mr. Moore said.\par \par \uc2 Find out what you need to know about the 2016 presidential race today, and get politics news updates via \uc2 Facebook\uc2 , \uc2 Twitter\uc2  and the First Draft newsletter.\par \par \uc2 Gov. Mike Pence of Indiana, the Republican vice-presidential candidate, after speaking last month at the First Baptist Church in Jacksonville, Fla.

\par\par \uc2 EDITORIAL OBSERVER\par \uc2 Editorial Desk; SECTA\par \b \uc2 Gov. Pence and Senator Kaine Face Off\b0\par\par\uc2 By ELIZABETH WILLIAMSON \par \uc2 601 \uc2 words\par \uc2 4 October 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 22\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 It's safe to say Tuesday's vice-presidential debate won't rival the Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 -Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  rumble for great television moments. It features two middle-aged, white, Midwest-raised politicians who call themselves ''boring'' (Tim Kaine) and ''B-list'' (\uc2 Mike Pence\uc2 ). And running mates play an even smaller role than usual in 2016, given the outsized personalities at the top of the tickets. But if these two men are willing to seriously engage the issues (and the rest of us are willing to stay awake), they could provide useful insights into their sharply contrasting plans for the future.\par \par \uc2 Such an exchange would be particularly illuminating on the Republican side.\par \par \uc2 Even to many in his own party, Mr. Pence, a former congressman and the sitting Indiana governor, struck a Faustian bargain by joining the \uc2 Trump\uc2  ticket. But he has tried to articulate a different set of principles, in contrast to dead-enders like \uc2 Rudolph Giuliani\uc2 , \uc2 Newt Gingrich\uc2  and \uc2 Chris Christie\uc2 . If Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  loses, Mr. Pence will likely be part of a rump of Republican leaders left to pick up the pieces and focus the party in a more positive direction.\par \par \uc2 Left largely on his own while the \uc2 Trump\uc2  inner circle fights fires (and each other), Mr. Pence has been trying to reassure conservatives and evangelicals that he'll represent them. A social conservative, his anti-abortion, anti-gay stances are deeply at odds with many Americans' views. At the same time, he has rejected Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's attacks on the family of an American Muslim soldier killed in Iraq, and distanced himself from Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's ''birther'' campaign.\par \par \uc2 Though he says he's against Obamacare, as governor he backed the Medicaid expansion that was central to it. He has waffled on the legal fate of 11 million undocumented immigrants, but he has not come out in favor of deporting them. He can legitimately claim firsthand experience and some successes confronting the hollowing-out of the American manufacturing economy. Mr. Pence may in fact be in a better position than Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  to reinforce the ticket's appeal to working-class voters, given Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's recent preoccupation with personal attacks and bizarre tweets.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Kaine, the junior senator from Virginia and its former governor, will field the first question of the debate from Elaine Quijano of \uc2 CBS News\uc2 , the moderator. At some point he'll surely attack Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's income tax filings. But it might be more interesting, given his fluent Spanish and service as a missionary in Honduras, to hear a clearer articulation of the \uc2 Clinton\uc2  campaign's vague promise of ''comprehensive immigration reform.'' What would that legislation contain, and how could it succeed?\par \par \uc2 Mr. Kaine could also spell out more fully why Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  reversed her position on the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade agreement. The campaign says it had to do with specific weaknesses in the agreement, but her turnabout still mystifies many voters.\par \par \uc2 The debate is set in Mr. Kaine's home state, Virginia, known for weak laws on influence peddling. What are Mr. Kaine's ideas for fulfilling a pledge to carry out tougher campaign finance laws?\par \par \uc2 This is the only time the vice-presidential nominees will debate before the \uc2 election\uc2 . Compared with the flaming barbecue that was last week's presidential debate, this one seems like boiled cauliflower. But a helping of policy substance might be good for everybody.\par \par \uc2 Follow The \uc2 New York Times\uc2  Opinion section on \uc2 Facebook\uc2  and \uc2 Twitter\uc2  (@NYTopinion), and sign up for the Opinion Today newsletter.\par \par \uc2 Document NYTF000020161004eca400068\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 OP-ED CONTRIBUTOR\par \uc2 Editorial Desk; SECTA\par \b \uc2 Financial Disclosure, Wrapped in Secrecy\b0\par\par\uc2 By JOHN WIHBEY and MIKE BEAUDET \par \uc2 1,043 \uc2 words\par \uc2 4 October 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 23\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 You don't learn much from tax returns,'' \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2  said last week in the first presidential debate. That line may become as famous a gaffe as Gerald Ford's claiming in a 1976 debate that Eastern Europe wasn't under Soviet domination.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's 1995 tax return, portions of which were published over the weekend by The \uc2 New York Times\uc2 , shows that he had such huge losses in the early 1990s that, thanks to incredibly favorable tax laws, he could have potentially avoided paying federal taxes for up to 18 years. We don't know how much tax he did avoid, since Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  won't release his other returns, and there is no law requiring him to.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  isn't the only candidate who says we'll just have to trust him. Across the country, there are laws that restrict access to information about public officials' financial holdings and connections. The result is a veil of secrecy that shields government officials from public scrutiny of potential conflicts of interests and self-dealing.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  did file a mandatory financial disclosure form with the \uc2 Federal \uc2 Election\uc2  Commission\uc2  that showed he earned at least $615 million in income in 2015. But as \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , who did release her tax returns, argued in the debate, the disclosure forms ''don't give you the tax rate. They don't give you all the details that tax returns would.''\par \par \uc2 We can't tell what Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  paid in taxes for 2015 or what he might have donated to charity. (For the record, Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  earned $6.5 million in 2015, paid an effective federal tax rate of 34 percent and donated more than $1 million to charity.)\par \par \uc2 But while corruption -- and the threat of corruption -- in Washington grabs the biggest headlines, the portion of state and local cases has generally grown as part of the overall public corruption caseload. The Department of Justice has charged more than 7,000 state and local officials with public corruption over the past two decades.\par \par \uc2 We have examined data across the 50 states, assessing the quality of information disclosed, the degree to which the data is accessible to the public and the integrity of the information disclosed. There is a litany of inadequacies.\par \par \uc2 Almost one-third of states currently do not allow online access to legislators' financial disclosure statements. Three states -- Michigan, Idaho and Vermont -- do not have a systematic method for lawmakers to reveal their financial disclosures at all. The release of tax returns is usually only a matter of custom in, for example, governor's races, and is not required of state legislators.\par \par \uc2 In our home state of Massachusetts, by law a someone requesting a form must show a state driver's license; the public official in question is then notified of the requester's name. This is a textbook form of deterrence: Just 125 individuals in Massachusetts requested financial disclosure forms in the entire 2014 calendar year, and only 58 requests were made in 2015.\par \par \uc2 In Maryland, which has aggressive disclosure requirements, 15,000 public servants must file annual financial statements. But hardly anyone is paying attention. Maryland law requires requesters to show up at the State Ethics Commission in person, and the public officials are notified of the requests. The commission estimates that fewer than a couple of dozen of those files are viewed by the public each year.\par \par \uc2 What is even more striking than the barriers to access, however, is the poor quality of information available.\par \par \uc2 We recently examined disclosure forms by governors across the country, and there is wild variation in disclosure standards. Some forms feature only the loosest of definitions for financial interests: There is no way to tell whether or not a public official has a deep or shallow tie to outside business interests.\par \par \uc2 Some forms don't require real estate holdings and gifts. Most bury relevant information in appendices. In Wyoming, public officials merely have to check a box if they have ''any security or interest earnings'' and ''real estate, leases, royalties.'' Check. But nothing more.\par \par \uc2 Further, most state ethics commissions tell us that they don't independently audit the statements. This kind of ''hear no evil, see no evil'' honor-system disclosure, lacking even the threat of a random audit, would be appalling to compliance officers and accountants across the private sector.\par \par \uc2 So how should we reform our disclosure laws? At a minimum, we believe all elected officials at the state and local level should have to file financial disclosures that list all their sources of income and amounts over the preceding 10 years. That information should be accessible online, and easy to find, for the public to review and analyze.\par \par \uc2 We also think disclosure forms at the state and local level should be designed for interpretation by average citizens, and forms should be more than just a year's snapshot -- they should paint a fuller picture of an official's major income sources and business ties over the past 10 years.\par \par \uc2 With trust in government at historic lows, we should demand that all officeholders with significant power -- presidential candidates, senators, congressmen, governors and state lawmakers -- disclose their tax returns. The issue is not a partisan one. We asked the question of our own Republican governor, \uc2 Charlie Baker\uc2 , who released his tax returns during the 2014 campaign. ''We're either going to have a standard that says everybody who runs should release their returns, or not,'' he said.\par \par \uc2 Transparency and disclosure won't solve all our problems. It will continue to take investigative reporters and watchdog groups to dig out conflicts of interest and connect the dots. That could prove harder than ever as the number of reporters in state capitols has continued to decline. But the process begins with access to information. If Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's taxes do nothing else, they should activate citizens to demand transparency at every level of government.\par \par \uc2 Follow The \uc2 New York Times\uc2  Opinion section on \uc2 Facebook\uc2  and \uc2 Twitter\uc2  (@NYTopinion), and sign up for the Opinion Today newsletter.\par \par \uc2 John Wihbey and Mike Beaudet teach at the School of Journalism at Northeastern University.\par \par \uc2 DRAWING (DRAWING BY OLIVER MUNDAY) \par \par \uc2 Document NYTF000020161004eca40006h\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Exactly a week before Tuesday's vice-presidential debate, \uc2 Gov. Mike Pence\uc2  of Indiana hunkered down with a small coterie of aides for his first full day of intensive debate preparation.\par \par \uc2 His team reserved rooms on the second floor of the Sheraton hotel in Madison, Wis., and Scott Walker -- the state's mild-mannered, affable governor -- arrived to play Mr. Pence's rival, Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia, in mock debate sessions.\par \par \uc2 Soon after, the actual Mr. Kaine left the campaign trail himself to huddle with advisers near Raleigh, N.C., for his own debate prep. A nearby bluegrass festival offered what seemed like a tempting distraction for the harmonica-playing senator, but Mr. Kaine stayed out of sight.\par \par \uc2 Last week hardly marked the first time the two men had devoted considerable time and attention to Tuesday's debate at \uc2 Longwood University\uc2  in Farmville, Va. For both Mr. Kaine and Mr. Pence, the vice-presidential debate, moderated by \uc2 CBS News\uc2 's Elaine Quijano, will be their lone one-on-one face-off this \uc2 election\uc2 , and is the most high-profile and highly anticipated moment of their political careers so far.\par \par \uc2 The debate can shed light on whether the No. 2 candidates are up to the job of being No. 1. But beyond showing their own mettle, the vice-presidential candidates also have the task of defending their running mates -- an especially critical job this time around with such an intense focus on the top of the ticket.\par \par \uc2 ''Don't screw up -- that's the goal of a V.P. debate,'' said Brett O'Donnell, a Republican communications specialist who advised prominent Republican nominees -- including President George W. Bush, Senator \uc2 John McCain\uc2  and \uc2 Gov. Mitt Romney\uc2  -- on debate preparation. ''The big thing is to defend the top of the ticket and then go on the offensive as much as possible against your opponent -- the top of the ticket on the other side.''\par \par \uc2 For Mr. Pence, the key challenge is to defend \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , the Republican presidential nominee, over some of his more outlandish comments, while also acquitting himself well as a reasonable, levelheaded conservative who could help rebuild the party whether Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  wins or loses.\par \par \uc2 Indeed, since his selection as a running mate, much of Mr. Pence's job has been to help explain or clean up Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's persona. Yet he has distanced himself in some important instances, including suggesting humans play a role in climate change -- an acknowledgment on the part of his aides that a political future inextricably tied to Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  could be perilous.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Pence already has experience defending his running mate on the Sunday news shows and in other television interviews, which aides say has also helped prepare him for the debate.\par \par \uc2 ''Ultimately, he's going to have to explain \uc2 Trump\uc2  to people, and his job is probably going to be to mop up whatever mistakes \uc2 Trump\uc2  makes and explain \uc2 Trump\uc2  and be the guy who says, '\uc2 Trump\uc2 's a good guy and he's not crazy,''' said John Feehery, a Republican strategist who is not working for the campaign.\par \par \uc2 But, Mr. Feehery added, though Mr. Pence has revealed himself as a loyal soldier, he is also likely to display at least some instinct of self-preservation. ''Part of it is to explain \uc2 Trump\uc2  but not necessarily fall on your sword for him,'' he said.\par \par \uc2 To that end, Mr. Kaine's task is more straightforward.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Kaine has already faced some tough questions about \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , the Democratic presidential nominee, on subjects like her use of a private email server and her trustworthiness. But he has not been forced to play cleanup the way Mr. Pence has.\par \par \uc2 On the campaign trail, Mr. Kaine cheerfully talks up Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's agenda while building a thorough case against Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  on a variety of subjects, from his refusal to release his tax returns to his views on foreign affairs. The debate offers a platform to do the same thing -- just on a much bigger and more pressure-filled stage.\par \par \uc2 ''It is going to be easier for him than it is for \uc2 Mike Pence\uc2 ,'' said Mo Elleithee, who advised Mr. Kaine when he ran for governor and senator and also worked on Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's 2008 presidential bid. ''Kaine genuinely, I think, shares \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's worldview.''\par \par \uc2 ''I would expect Kaine is going to be hitting a lot of the same themes that \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  hit in the last debate,'' added Mr. Elleithee, who is now the executive director of Georgetown University's Institute of Politics and Public Service.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Kaine has prepared to fend off what his advisers expect will be aggressive attacks by Mr. Pence aimed at Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , according to campaign aides. And his team is wondering how far Mr. Pence will go in defending Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Mr. Kaine does not devote much time to talking about Mr. Pence when he campaigns, and his focus on the top of the ticket is not likely to change on Tuesday night.\par \par \uc2 ''It really is more about \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  than it is about Governor Pence,'' Mr. Kaine told reporters on his campaign plane recently, discussing the vice-presidential debate.\par \par \uc2 Similarly, Mr. Kaine is set to promote what a \uc2 Clinton\uc2  presidency would look like. ''If I talk too much about Tim Kaine during my debate,'' he said, ''I'm wasting my time.''\par \par \uc2 If Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's debate preparation so far has largely resembled his campaign -- haphazard and unfocused -- Mr. Pence's reflects his sharply different approach: methodical, disciplined and systematic.\par \par \uc2 He and his team began preparing for the debate shortly before Labor Day, and each week have devoted an increasing amount of time to the effort. (Fridays, which Mr. Pence typically spends off the trail and in the Indiana governor's mansion, have become largely focused on debate preparation.)\par \par \uc2 He has been studying briefing books, and dossiers on his laptop. The \uc2 Republican National Committee\uc2  has also uploaded copious videos of Mr. Kaine -- everything from interviews to past debates -- to an online file-sharing service for Mr. Pence to view.\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 Clinton\uc2  team has revealed little about Mr. Kaine's preparations, though Mr. Kaine talked a few weeks ago about reading ''endless debate prep memos,'' a subject that he said Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  had joked to him about. ''She said, 'You know, our staffs know how to kill a lot of trees by putting together massive books,''' he said.\par \par \uc2 In Mr. Kaine's mock debate sessions, Mr. Pence is being played by Robert B. Barnett, a Washington lawyer who has long served as a faux adversary in debate preparations for presidential and vice-presidential candidates. Earlier in the campaign, he played Senator Bernie Sanders when Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  practiced to debate him.\par \par \uc2 Jerry Kilgore, a Republican who ran against Mr. Kaine for governor in 2005, said he found debating Mr. Kaine a frustrating experience.\par \par \uc2 ''He's absolutely going to come off as believable with everything he says,'' Mr. Kilgore said. ''He says everything with such sincerity.'' He added that Mr. Kaine came across that way whether or not Mr. Kaine was being completely forthright.\par \par \uc2 ''That's the danger Governor Pence has in this debate,'' said Mr. Kilgore, a former Virginia attorney general.\par \par \uc2 When Mr. Pence accepted the No. 2 slot, he and his team outlined three milestones they believed would require flawless execution: his initial rollout, his convention speech and the debate. The same close-knit team of advisers who helped plan the first two milestones -- Nick Ayers, the chairman of the vice-presidential campaign; Marc Short, a senior adviser; and Josh Pitcock, the campaign's policy director -- have also been handling Mr. Pence's preparation.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Pence's team decided it would be smart for him to attend last Monday's debate at \uc2 Hofstra University\uc2  -- not just to cheer on Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , but to experience the drama and atmosphere of a presidential debate, without the high-stakes pressure.\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 Clinton\uc2  team took a different approach. Mr. Kaine dropped by a debate watch party in Orlando, Fla., but left before the debate began.\par \par \uc2 ''I wish I could actually hang and watch it with you, but I'm actually doing homework tonight,'' he told the crowd. ''I have to go sit down and get in the zone and with a yellow pad, you know, take a million notes.''\par \par \uc2 Find out what you need to know about the 2016 presidential race today, and get politics news updates via \uc2 Facebook\uc2 , \uc2 Twitter\uc2  and the First Draft newsletter.\par \par \uc2 Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia, the Democratic vice-presidential candidate, last month at a campaign rally in Ann Arbor, Mich.

\par\par \uc2 Metropolitan Desk; SECTA\par \b \uc2 'Marquee Race' Upstate Pits Political Newcomer Against a Local Insider\b0\par\par\uc2 By WILLIAM NEUMAN \par \uc2 1,497 \uc2 words\par \uc2 4 October 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 21\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 NEW PALTZ, N.Y. -- The two candidates, current and former, stood with arms around each other, an American flag behind them, an adoring crowd before them.\par \par \uc2 Most of the rally's attendees came for Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, whose campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination became a grass-roots phenomenon. But Mr. Sanders was there to support a Democrat with grass-roots credentials of her own: Zephyr Teachout, who is running for Congress.\par \par \uc2 In some ways, the race in New York's 19th Congressional District, which reaches across 11 upstate counties, is the presidential race turned inside out.\par \par \uc2 The Republican candidate, John J. Faso, is a career political insider who will not say if he will vote for his party's outsider nominee for president, \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2 . Ms. Teachout is a political insurgent more closely aligned with Mr. Sanders than her party's establishment candidate, \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Mr. Faso is a former state assemblyman who ran unsuccessfully for governor against Eliot Spitzer in 2006 and for state comptroller in 2002. Ms. Teachout is a law professor who made a surprisingly strong showing against \uc2 Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo\uc2  in the Democratic primary two years ago.\par \par \uc2 They are seeking to capture the open seat being vacated by Representative Chris Gibson, a Republican who announced in May that he was leaving politics.\par \par \uc2 ''This is the marquee race, and if the Democrats are to make real gains in the House nationally this is the kind of seat that they need to pick up,'' said Bruce N. Gyory, a Democratic political consultant. ''You have the classic boxers' match between the ring-wise boxing technician versus the young up and comer.''\par \par \uc2 The contest is close: A Time Warner Cable News/Siena College poll released last week had the race as a virtual tie, with Mr. Faso receiving 43 percent and Ms. Teachout receiving 42 percent, with 15 percent undecided. The poll had a margin of sampling error of 3.8 percentage points.\par \par \uc2 The district is one of just six of the state's 27 congressional districts where Mr. Sanders beat Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  in the presidential primary in April, and Mr. Sanders has enthusiastically supported Ms. Teachout, whose left-of-center views echo his own.\par \par \uc2 At the rally on Sept. 16, Mr. Sanders and Ms. Teachout attracted more than 1,000 people to a grassy park in New Paltz, home to a campus of the \uc2 State University of New York\uc2 , where many students are avid Sanders supporters.\par \par \uc2 ''This race is one of the most important congressional races in America because the choices are so clear,'' Mr. Sanders said, contrasting the two candidates on issues like campaign finance and free trade.\par \par \uc2 Ms. Teachout and Mr. Faso certainly have starkly different views on policy. She sits firmly in the Democratic Party's left wing, while his hard-right voting record in the Assembly, including a vote against equal pay for women and longstanding opposition to abortion rights, led more moderate Republicans to initially resist his candidacy for governor in 2006.\par \par \uc2 Yet the race may turn on other factors.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Faso is well known in the district, which encompasses a large part of the Catskills, a section of the Hudson Valley and includes the Assembly district that he represented for 16 years. His two campaigns for statewide office raised his profile further.\par \par \uc2 In contrast, Ms. Teachout is a newcomer to the district, where she moved last year from Brooklyn. She also is relatively new to politics: The 2014 primary race against Mr. Cuomo was her first.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Faso has criticized his opponent as a carpetbagger and for being politically out of step with the district. ''She's pie in the sky and I'm practical,'' he said.\par \par \uc2 Campaigning at an apple festival in Germantown on a recent Saturday, many of the people with whom Mr. Faso shook hands had known him, at least casually, for years.\par \par \uc2 ''All I know about Zephyr Teachout is she was in the governor's race at one point,'' said Frank Santacroce, 78, a volunteer at the festival who chatted briefly with Mr. Faso. ''It makes it tough to decide.''\par \par \uc2 Mr. Santacroce said he usually voted Republican, but was willing to cross party lines, although not in this case. ''I know John Faso,'' he said. ''You have to say he's a nice guy.''\par \par \uc2 A day earlier, at the Sanders rally for Ms. Teachout in New Paltz, Molly Franco, 21, a \uc2 SUNY\uc2  student, said that her sociology class, which usually met at that time, had insisted that their professor let them attend the rally. But Mr. Sanders was the draw. Without him, she said, ''probably a couple people would come if they said it was extra credit.''\par \par \uc2 Ms. Franco said that she had not yet taken a close look at the congressional candidates, but that Mr. Sanders's endorsement of Ms. Teachout could help persuade her.\par \par \uc2 The district is almost equally divided along party lines, with 135,193 active voters registered as Republicans and 132,818 registered as Democrats, according to the State Board of Elections. There is also a large contingent of independent voters, with 114,577 active voters holding no party affiliation.\par \par \uc2 Both parties have singled out the race as a priority, but the National Republican Congressional Committee and allied groups have committed far more money.\par \par \uc2 The N.R.C.C. and the Congressional Leadership Fund, a ''super PAC'' that supports Republican House candidates, have spent more than $800,000 so far on television advertising, and the N.R.C.C. has reserved additional television time worth more than $1.4 million. The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee has spent just $80,000 and reserved about $100,000. The expenditures were provided by two people, one Democrat and one Republican, who had access to data that tracked political spending from both parties but were not authorized to disclose them.\par \par \uc2 Both candidates said the race could come down to independent voters.\par \par \uc2 ''It is one of the swingiest districts you'll find in America,'' Ms. Teachout said in an interview after the rally, listing candidates who had won there in recent years, including President Obama, a Democrat, and Mr. Gibson. ''What you see there is people making an independent choice,'' she said.\par \par \uc2 Ms. Teachout said her campaign had been financed, as was Mr. Sanders's, largely by small internet donations, with the average contribution being $19. In contrast, she said, Mr. Faso is supported by a super PAC that has taken contributions of $600,000 and $500,000 from two hedge fund managers who are major Republican donors.\par \par \uc2 Ms. Teachout had raised $1.6 million through the end of June, according to the most recent filing with the \uc2 Federal \uc2 Election\uc2  Commission\uc2 , while Mr. Faso had raised $1.4 million. But Ms. Teachout still had $1.1 million left to spend while Mr. Faso had just $147,000.\par \par \uc2 In her conversations with voters, Ms. Teachout said she heard the anti-establishment anger that led to the popularity of Mr. Sanders and Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 ''They are not looking for a career politician,'' she said. ''I'm not going to be beholden. I'm bottom up.''\par \par \uc2 Ms. Teachout stands to gain from Mr. Sanders's sway with the party's most liberal voters and could also get a boost if Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  has a strong showing against Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 That is where Mr. Faso's road gets bumpier.\par \par \uc2 ''I'm going to support the Republican nominee,'' Mr. Faso said in an interview at a Germantown coffee shop. But he refused to say if he would vote for Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Pressed to give a yes or no answer, he said: ''I'm not saying I'll vote for him. I'm not saying I won't vote for him. I'm saying I have some clear policy differences with him. I'm not voting for \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 .''\par \par \uc2 In the April primary, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  won 60 percent of the vote in the district, a strong showing but far from his best in the state, where he won every congressional district but one. Mr. Faso acknowledged that Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  could cost him some votes among independents.\par \par \uc2 While Mr. Faso casts Ms. Teachout as an outsider to the district, she portrays him as an insider of the political establishment, emphasizing his work, since leaving government, as a lobbyist\par \par \uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Mr. Faso predicted that the race would come down to some basic choices between liberal and conservative, idealism and experience. ''In some respects,'' he said, ''it's a barometer as to what approach the country wants to take.''\par \par \uc2 John J. Faso, a Republican former state assemblyman, visited an apple festival as part of his bid for a congressional seat.; Zephyr Teachout, the Democratic candidate, with Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont. She and her rival, Mr. Faso, are not closely tied to the heads of their parties.

On the same day, voters in Brazil handed a resounding defeat to the leftist party that once controlled their country, knocking it down in municipal elections.\par \par \uc2 It was just another sign of the shift to the right in Latin America. In less than a year, voters have thwarted the leftist movement in Argentina and elected a former investment banker as president of Peru, while lawmakers impeached the leftist leader of Brazil.\par \par \uc2 ''Put simply, conservatives are on the rise in Latin America,'' said Mat\u237\'00\'EDas Spektor, a professor of international relations at \uc2 Funda\u231\'00\'E7\u227\'00\'E3o Get\u250\'00\'FAlio Vargas\uc2 , a university in Brazil.\par \par \uc2 Many factors are feeding the trend. The sharp drop in commodities prices has eroded economic growth around Latin America and the support leftist governments once drew from it. The clout of evangelical Christian megachurches is expanding, and they are confronting socially liberal policies and channeling widespread dissatisfaction with the status quo.\par \par \uc2 But in one country after another, the results are the same: Leaders embracing market-friendly policies are eclipsing the leftists who exerted sway around the Americas in the previous decade. Once-powerful leftist presidents like \uc2 Luiz In\u225\'00\'E1cio Lula da Silva\uc2  of Brazil and Cristina Fern\u225\'00\'E1ndez de Kirchner of Argentina now face corruption inquiries.\par \par \uc2 Still, political analysts caution that the trend does not necessarily involve a wholesale rejection of the policies that won admiration and votes for leftist governments in previous years. For instance, \uc2 Michel Temer\uc2  and \uc2 Mauricio Macri\uc2 , the leaders of Brazil and Argentina, have expressed support for maintaining popular antipoverty programs.\par \par \uc2 Peru's new president, Pedro Pablo Kuczynski, relied on an alliance with the left to defeat his rival, Keiko Fujimori, the daughter of Alberto Fujimori, the imprisoned former president.\par \par \uc2 Likewise, Colombia's vote on the peace deal offered an example of how unpredictable politics is getting in some parts of Latin America. Leaders around the region -- from an array of ideological backgrounds -- had supported the agreement, which was forged between President Juan Manuel Santos and the \uc2 Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia\uc2 , or \uc2 the FARC\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Colombians rebuffed the deal largely because they thought it was too lenient on \uc2 the FARC\uc2 , enabling most fighters to walk away scot-free. But the result also showed how ready voters were to reject what the political establishment was offering.\par \par \uc2 ''Voters defying the status quo is hardly peculiar to Colombia,'' said Michael Shifter, president of Inter-American Dialogue, a policy group in Washington. ''It fits a pattern that can be discerned in Argentina, Brazil, Venezuela, Mexico and other countries.''\par \par \uc2 Leaders around Latin America are paying close attention to the shifting mood in their countries. In Chile, President Michelle Bachelet returned to office in a landslide in 2013 on a platform of reducing inequality.\par \par \uc2 But Ms. Bachelet shifted course in the face of a slowing economy and a graft scandal involving her family, naming a finance minister respected by the business establishment. Her government's budget for 2017 prioritizes Chile's tradition of fiscal prudence while reining in stimulus spending.\par \par \uc2 In Brazil, a country of 206 million, half of South America's population, the shift to the right has unfolded against a backdrop of rising political divisiveness.\par \par \uc2 Supporters of the impeached president, \uc2 Dilma Rousseff\uc2 , argue that her ouster was the equivalent of a coup, a view that has weighed on the legitimacy of Mr. Temer, her former vice president who rebelled against her. Candidates from his centrist Brazilian Democratic Movement Party were also roundly defeated in Sunday's mayoral elections in Brazil's largest cities.\par \par \uc2 But the Brazilian Social Democracy Party, which had its origins in the opposition to the country's military dictatorship before evolving into a more conservative grouping that now anchors Mr. Temer's coalition, scored big gains. One of the party's members, Jo\u227\'00\'E3o Doria, a former host of a reality television show that involved firing participants on the air, glided to victory in the mayoral race in S\u227\'00\'E3o Paulo, Brazil's largest city.\par \par \uc2 Some in the region see parallels with the ''Brexit'' vote in which Britain elected to leave the \uc2 European Union\uc2 , or the chance that \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , who also starred in a reality game show in which he fired contestants, will win the presidential \uc2 election\uc2  in the United States.\par \par \uc2 The vote in Colombia reflected a shift ''from magical realism to tragic realism,'' the Colombian writer H\u233\'00\'E9ctor Abad Faciolince said on \uc2 Twitter\uc2 , referring to the mythical narratives of Latin American authors like Gabriel Garc\u237\'00\'EDa M\u225\'00\'E1rquez. ''All that's left now is for \uc2 Trump\uc2  to win.''\par \par \uc2 Colombia, for its part, has long defied easy explanations of its politics. A top ally of Washington in Latin America, the country has traditionally been more politically conservative than some of its neighbors, even as nominally leftist guerrillas persisted for decades in its jungles.\par \par \uc2 The rightward shift has stalled in some parts of the region. While the opposition won control of Venezuela's National Assembly earlier this year, the country's leftist president, Nicol\u225\'00\'E1s Maduro, has managed to delay a referendum to remove him from office despite the collapsing economy.\par \par \uc2 In Bolivia, the leftist government of President Evo Morales has won plaudits from the \uc2 International Monetary Fund\uc2  for its management of the economy. \uc2 Bolivia's central bank\uc2  said in September that it expected gross domestic product to expand by about 5 percent this year, ranking it among Latin America's fastest-growing economies.\par \par \uc2 But in a recent speech peppered with references to Marx and Lenin, even Bolivia's vice president, \u193\'00\'C1lvaro Garc\u237\'00\'EDa Linera, acknowledged the ebbing influence of leftists in the region.\par \par \uc2 ''We are facing a historical turning point in the region; some are talking about a throwback,'' Mr. Garc\u237\'00\'EDa Linera said, comparing the current situation to previous periods of conservative resurgence in Latin America. ''We must relearn what we learned in the '80s and '90s, when everything was against us.''\par \par \uc2 As leaders on the left pick up the pieces in parts of Latin America, their dilemma now resembles that of the conservative politicians they long struggled to dislodge.\par \par \uc2 ''We can think of the shift as a Latin American variant of the West's blossoming romance with anti-establishment movements,'' Mohamed A. El-Erian, the chief economic adviser at Allianz, the German financial services giant, wrote in a recent essay. ''For now, rightist parties and policy agendas are the main beneficiaries of the region's economic and social disillusion.''\par \par \uc2 Dilma Rousseff, a leftist, was impeached amid a divisive political climate in Brazil.

\par\par \uc2 ON WASHINGTON\par \uc2 National Desk; SECTA\par \b \uc2 G.O.P. Chiefs of Two Minds on Split Power\b0\par\par\uc2 By CARL HULSE \par \uc2 993 \uc2 words\par \uc2 4 October 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 11\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 WASHINGTON -- The top two Republicans in Congress are divided when it comes to divided government.\par \par \uc2 Speaker Paul D. Ryan says he has had it with Republicans and Democrats sharing power, complaining that it breeds dysfunction and prevents major accomplishments.\par \par \uc2 In contrast, Senator Mitch McConnell, the majority leader, says those periods when the parties split control of Congress and the White House are the ideal time to get big things done.\par \par \uc2 One of these Republican leaders -- their differing views shaped by their individual experiences and the characteristics of their chambers -- is likely to get an opportunity to prove his political theory correct next year.\par \par \uc2 While there is a chance that \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2  will win the White House and Republicans will hold the House and Senate, current polling suggests it is more likely that \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  will win the presidency and Republicans will more narrowly control one or both chambers of Congress.\par \par \uc2 Such an outcome would test whether lawmakers of both parties, often unable to perform basic tasks like funding the government, can find a way to restore a sense of elemental competence to Washington.\par \par \uc2 Mr. McConnell has long articulated his belief that a divided government can spur politically risky deals that neither party would attempt alone. He noted last week that Ronald Reagan and Speaker Tip O'Neill, Democrat of Massachusetts, struck major accords on Social Security and taxes in the 1980s, and that President \uc2 Bill \uc2 Clinton\uc2  and congressional Republicans overhauled welfare and balanced the budget in the 1990s.\par \par \uc2 ''Divided government is actually the best government,'' Mr. McConnell said, ''the best time to tackle really difficult things, because it requires both sides to buy into it to make progress.''\par \par \uc2 So why have the last six years of extremely divided government been one long series of legislative stalemates, shutdown showdowns and budget failures? Mr. McConnell blames President \uc2 Obama\uc2 , seen by many Republicans as a neophyte in dealing with Capitol Hill.\par \par \uc2 ''My greatest disappointment with President \uc2 Obama\uc2  is that we had numerous discussions on all of those issues,'' Mr. McConnell said, referring to the need for changes in entitlement programs like Social Security and Medicare. ''And he was not willing to move to the political center, which obviously would have been necessary since he hasn't had control of Congress for six years, in order to achieve that.''\par \par \uc2 Democrats, unsurprisingly, strongly disagree. After Mr. McConnell's recent comments, the office of Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, his Democratic adversary, released data showing that Mr. Reid had been notably more productive in terms of legislation and confirmations in two years as majority leader with President George W. Bush than Mr. McConnell had been with \uc2 Mr. Obama\uc2 , whom Mr. McConnell famously said he wanted to make a one-term president.\par \par \uc2 ''History will look back and note that Republicans in Congress treated President \uc2 Obama\uc2  with unprecedented disrespect,'' Mr. Reid said last week.\par \par \uc2 ''No one expected them to agree with everything that he did or tried to do, but Americans deserve better than the way Republicans behaved toward President \uc2 Obama\uc2 .''\par \par \uc2 House Republicans also share culpability in the failures of the most recent period of divided government. When \uc2 John A. Boehner\uc2  was speaker, he repeatedly tried to play the role that O'Neill had and cut a grand bargain with the president of the opposing party. He was held back by threats to his leadership within his own party and an uncertainty among Democrats about whether he could deliver the votes.\par \par \uc2 The price he paid was being driven from office by hard-right conservatives who were outraged at his willingness to compromise.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Ryan, who has experienced some of the same difficulties with his party's right wing while managing to contain the dissension, is ready for an all-Republican government.\par \par \uc2 ''I'm tired of divided government'' Mr. Ryan said at a Washington forum sponsored by The Atlantic. ''It doesn't work very well.''\par \par \uc2 ''We're just at loggerheads,'' he said. ''We've gotten some good things done. But the big things -- poverty, the debt crisis, the economy, health care -- these things are stuck in divided government, and that's why we think a unified Republican government's the way to go.''\par \par \uc2 That view is in line with the perspective of someone who has been shaped by the House, where the majority has a strong hand and can force through legislation with little concern for the minority party's view.\par \par \uc2 There have been recent examples of the setup Mr. Ryan would prefer. In the first two years of \uc2 Mr. Obama\uc2 's presidency, Democrats held a filibuster-proof 60 votes in the Senate and a sizable majority in the House. Together, they did produce a flood of legislation, including the health care law, Wall Street regulation and the economic stimulus.\par \par \uc2 Still, the enactment of those major initiatives along mainly partisan lines fed a fierce sense of retribution, a factor that eventually cost Democrats control of Congress and contributed to an increasingly poisonous political atmosphere.\par \par \uc2 Many on Capitol Hill believe Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  has both the experience and love of the policy process that would allow her to forge a working relationship with congressional Republicans.\par \par \uc2 Some lawmakers also think that perhaps the least plausible \uc2 election\uc2  outcome -- a \uc2 Trump\uc2  presidency and a Democratic Senate -- could produce some legislative gains.\par \par \uc2 Whatever the new configuration of government, the incoming president and members of Congress will face real pressure to deliver from a public increasingly fed up with stasis in Washington.\par \par \uc2 Find out what you need to know about the 2016 presidential race today, and get politics news updates via \uc2 Facebook\uc2 , \uc2 Twitter\uc2  and the First Draft newsletter.\par \par \uc2 Senator Mitch McConnell, left, the majority leader, feels that a divided government can facilitate deal-making, but Speaker Paul D. Ryan says that sharing power breeds only dysfunction.

\par\par \uc2 Business/Financial Desk; SECTB\par \b \uc2 Four From \uc2 BuzzFeed\uc2 's Politics Team Defect to \uc2 CNN\b0\par\par\uc2 By SYDNEY EMBER; John Koblin contributed reporting. \par \uc2 701 \uc2 words\par \uc2 4 October 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 2\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Andrew Kaczynski, the BuzzFeed reporter whose scoop about \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's early support for the invasion of Iraq surfaced in the presidential debate last week, is leaving to join \uc2 CNN\uc2 , just a month before the \uc2 election\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 The two other members of \uc2 BuzzFeed\uc2 's political research team, Nathan McDermott and Christopher Massie, and Kyle Blaine, the deputy politics editor, are also going to \uc2 CNN\uc2 , leaving \uc2 BuzzFeed\uc2  short-handed for the final stretch of the campaign.\par \par \uc2 The departures, which come only weeks after \uc2 BuzzFeed\uc2  said it was formally dividing its news and entertainment divisions, are also likely to resurface questions about the company's plans for its news operation.\par \par \uc2 Even by the standards of an industry where turnover is common, the suddenness of Mr. Kaczynski's move was surprising. Mr. Kaczynski and the three others officially resigned from \uc2 BuzzFeed\uc2  on Monday. \uc2 Andrew Morse\uc2 , an executive vice president for CNN and head of CNN Digital, said in a telephone interview: ''We're having conversations today. You could make the case that they already started today.''\par \par \uc2 The moves also leave a void at \uc2 BuzzFeed\uc2 , which has built its news reputation on its political coverage and is gearing up for what will probably be a frenetic last month of the campaign. Mr. Kaczynski, 26, who announced he was joining \uc2 BuzzFeed\uc2  in late 2011 while still a student at St. John's University, was among the first hires on the news side. Under \uc2 Ben Smith\uc2 , a star political reporter at Politico before joining \uc2 BuzzFeed\uc2  as editor in chief, Mr. Kaczynski and a team of reporters aggressively covered the 2012 presidential race, elevating the company's reputation and drawing respect, some of it grudging, from established news organizations.\par \par \uc2 The departures could also feed the apparent feud between Jeff Zucker, the president of CNN, who recently said he did not think \uc2 BuzzFeed\uc2  was a ''legitimate'' news organization, and Mr. Smith, who said that \uc2 CNN\uc2  had given too much airtime to \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  in the interest of ratings.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Kaczynski declined to be interviewed and referred questions to \uc2 CNN\uc2 . But in an interview with The Huffington Post, which first reported the moves, Mr. Kaczynski said: ''To be at the biggest name in news for the last month of what has been the craziest \uc2 election\uc2  in modern history is just a great opportunity for me and everybody on our team.''\par \par \uc2 During this campaign, Mr. Kaczynski and his team have published attention-grabbing articles, including one last week about Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's appearance in a Playboy video from 2000.\par \par \uc2 In February, Mr. McDermott and Mr. Kaczynski wrote an article about a 2002 interview with \uc2 Howard Stern\uc2  during which Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  said he supported the invasion of Iraq. Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  has repeatedly said that he opposed the Iraq War, an issue that has come up frequently during the campaign. Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  mentioned the interview during the presidential debate last week, saying the interview showed he was right.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Smith praised Mr. Kaczynski on \uc2 Twitter\uc2  at the time, saying, ''A huge part of this debate is rooted in @BuzzFeedAndrew's reporting.''\par \par \uc2 Mr. Morse of \uc2 CNN\uc2  said that Mr. Kaczynski and his team had been ''on our radar for the last two years'' and that they began having discussions in the last few weeks.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Morse suggested that they made the decision to join \uc2 CNN\uc2  very recently. ''It started moving very quickly over the last couple of days, and we had some pretty intense conversations over the weekend,'' he said.\par \par \uc2 ''There was no question about taking a beat at all,'' he added. ''The notion was, let's get them in the door as quickly as possible. And their only question for us: When can we get our computers and when can we get started?''\par \par \uc2 On Monday, Mr. Smith said in an email: ''I guess this means that \uc2 CNN\uc2  has seen the value in doing the kind of tough reporting on \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  that \uc2 BuzzFeed\uc2  News has been doing all presidential cycle, and we wish Andrew good luck.''\par \par \uc2 Andrew Kaczynski on CNN in 2013. His and others' sudden departure from BuzzFeed leaves the organization short-handed. \par \par \uc2 Document NYTF000020161004eca40003r\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 Politics; SECT\par \b \uc2 From Mondale to Palin, the Hits From Past Vice-Presidential Debates\b0\par\par\uc2 By ALAN RAPPEPORT \par \uc2 934 \uc2 words\par \uc2 4 October 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 The New York Times on the Web\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Vice-presidential debates tend not to get the same billing as the top of the ticket ones, but that does not mean they don't matter.\par \par \uc2 From Lloyd Bentsen famously dressing down Dan Quayle as ''no Jack Kennedy'' to Adm. James B. Stockdale, H. Ross Perot's No. 2, waxing existential to show his outsider status, running mates have a penchant for providing memorable moments. Although voters tend to cast their ballots based on who will sit in the Oval Office, a strong showing or a blunder by a vice-presidential hopeful can provide a boost or be a drag on a campaign.\par \par \uc2 As \uc2 Gov. Mike Pence\uc2  and Senator Tim Kaine prepare to take the stage on Tuesday, we take a look back at how some of their predecessors have fared.\par \par \uc2 'A hatchet man'\par \par \uc2 Political nicknames have been all the rage in 2016, with \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2  calling his rivals ''crooked,'' ''low energy'' and more.\par \par \uc2 But the practice is not a new one.\par \par \uc2 In the 1976 vice-presidential debate, Walter F. Mondale, who was running with \uc2 Jimmy Carter\uc2 , damaged his opponent \uc2 Bob Dole\uc2 , who ran with Gerald R. Ford, by calling him a ''hatchet man.''\par \par \uc2 [Video: Dole-Mondale debate excerpt Watch on \uc2 YouTube\uc2 .]\par \par \uc2 After Mr. Dole asserted that 1.6 million Americans had died in ''Democrat wars,'' Mr. Mondale shot back angrily: '''I think Senator Dole has richly earned his reputation as a hatchet man tonight. Does he really mean that there was a partisan difference over our involvement in the fight against Nazi Germany?''\par \par \uc2 The moniker had been used on Mr. Dole before, but in a televised debate it cast him in a Nixonian darkness that he never completely shook.\par \par \uc2 'Your patronizing attitude'\par \par \uc2 Patronizing a debate opponent is always potentially perilous, and George Bush fell into that trap in 1984 when he went up against Geraldine A. Ferraro, the first woman on a major party ticket.\par \par \uc2 During an exchange on foreign policy, Mr. Bush offered to lend some of his expertise to his opponent when he said, ''Let me help you with the difference, Mrs. Ferraro, between Iran and the embassy in Lebanon.''\par \par \uc2 [Video: Bush-Ferraro debate excerpt Watch on \uc2 YouTube\uc2 .]\par \par \uc2 Ms. Ferraro was having none of it.\par \par \uc2 ''I almost resent, Vice President Bush, your patronizing attitude that you have to teach me about foreign policy,'' she shot back.\par \par \uc2 To make matters worse, Mr. Bush was caught gloating about his performance on an open microphone after the debate.\par \par \uc2 ''We tried to kick a little ass last night,'' he said.\par \par \uc2 'Senator, you're no Jack Kennedy'\par \par \uc2 Senator Lloyd Bentsen of Texas, the running mate of Michael S. Dukakis, never became vice president, but he is responsible for perhaps the most famous zinger in vice-presidential debate history.\par \par \uc2 In 1988, the youthful Senator Dan Quayle of Indiana was giving a long explanation of about how he was more experienced than he looked on the debate stage in Omaha. But George Bush's campaign partner got into trouble when he said that he had as much experience serving in Congress as John F. Kennedy did when he ran for president.\par \par \uc2 [Video: "Senator, you're no Jack Kennedy" ('88 VP Debate) Watch on \uc2 YouTube\uc2 .]\par \par \uc2 Mr. Bentsen responded sharply: ''Senator, I served with Jack Kennedy. I knew Jack Kennedy. Jack Kennedy was a friend of mine. Senator, you're no Jack Kennedy.''\par \par \uc2 The audience roared and Mr. Quayle recoiled. Even though the Bush-Quayle ticket won the \uc2 election\uc2 , Mr. Quayle was for years viewed as a lightweight.\par \par \uc2 'Who am I? Why am I here?'\par \par \uc2 It was highly unusual for a third-party candidate to be on the national debate stage, and when it happened to Vice Admiral Stockdale in 1992, he seemed surprised to be there.\par \par \uc2 Standing between Vice President Quayle and Senator Al Gore, Mr. Stockdale's head mostly swiveled back for much of the night as he observed his opponents' rapid-fire exchanges.\par \par \uc2 [Video: Admiral Stockdale - 1992 VP Debate - "Who Am I? Why Am I Here?" Watch on \uc2 YouTube\uc2 .]\par \par \uc2 Whether it was nerves, a joke that fell flat or a little bit of both, the retired admiral is best remembered these days for addressing the audience during his opening statement with an unusual question.\par \par \uc2 ''Who am I?'' he asked. ''Why am I here? I'm not a politician.''\par \par \uc2 Things went downhill from there.\par \par \uc2 The Times summed up Mr. Stockdale's performance as such: ''His hands shook with nerves. He stammered. He paused in the middle of his opening statement to put on his reading glasses.''\par \par \uc2 To memorialize Mr. Stockdale's miscues, ''Saturday Night Live'' mocked him in a number of skits that year.\par \par \uc2 'Can I call you Joe?'\par \par \uc2 Sarah Palin\uc2 's selection as Senator \uc2 John McCain\uc2 's running mate shocked the political world in 2008, and the rollout of her candidacy came with many hitches.\par \par \uc2 The high point, perhaps, was a surprisingly steady debate performance against \uc2 Joseph R. Biden Jr\uc2 ., the Democratic senator from Delaware.\par \par \uc2 [Video: \uc2 C-SPAN\uc2 : Full Vice Presidential Debate with Gov. Palin and Sen. Biden Watch on \uc2 YouTube\uc2 .]\par \par \uc2 Ms. Palin, then a first-term Republican governor from Alaska, took the stage and greeted Mr. Biden by asking him, ''Hey, can I call you Joe?''\par \par \uc2 He gamely agreed and the exchange was seen as a warm and humanizing moment for Ms. Palin, who had emerged as a firebrand on the campaign trail.\par \par \uc2 Find out what you need to know about the 2016 presidential race today, and get politics news updates via \uc2 Facebook\uc2 , \uc2 Twitter\uc2  and the First Draft newsletter.\par \par \uc2 Document NYTF000020161004eca40003b\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

\par\par \b \uc2 Election\uc2  2016: Tax Benefits Flow to Real Estate\b0\par\par\uc2 By John D. McKinnon and Laura Saunders   \par \uc2 689 \uc2 words\par \uc2 4 October 2016\par \uc2 The Wall Street Journal\par \uc2 J\par A4\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 Racking up huge losses on a personal income-tax return, as \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  apparently did in 1995, isn't that tough if you reside at the highest levels of the real-estate world, thanks to the considerable benefits the U.S. tax code confers.\par \par \uc2 In part because of those benefits, real-estate businesses often are formed and taxed as partnerships or limited-liability companies, known as LLCs, rather than taxable corporations. That way, profits -- and potentially juicy tax losses -- flow directly to owners' personal tax returns, allowing individuals to use those losses to minimize or eliminate years of future tax liability on other types of income.\par \par \uc2 Real-estate professionals also enjoy numerous exceptions to the tax rules that typically limit the usefulness of deductions tied to losses for other kinds of investors. That reflects the enduring influence the industry has in Washington, allowing it hold on to specialized benefits originally designed to help developers and investors recover from severe downturns in the past.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  himself spoke of the law's complexity, and the many ways he benefited, Monday in Pueblo, Colo. After calling tax laws unfair, he said he "legally used" those laws to his benefit. His familiarity with those laws, he said, made him "one who can truly fix them."\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  has proposed big changes to the tax code, but his campaign has put forward little so far that would address the enormous complexities he mentions or seek to limit the many provisions the real-estate industry enjoys.\par \par \uc2 Under some circumstances, real-estate business owners such as Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  can even take losses on properties that were highly leveraged through loans. That is despite rules that Congress created to avoid tax windfalls for business owners when their loans are written off or renegotiated.\par \par \uc2 While forgiveness of debt often counts as taxable income, experts say there are ways for sophisticated real-estate investors to postpone it indefinitely. One way is to forgo future deductions on other properties instead of owing current taxes on the forgiveness, said \uc2 David Lifson\uc2 , a certified public accountant with Crowe Horwath in New York who advises high-net-worth clients.\par \par \uc2 Another strategy, he said, is to avoid forgiveness of debt by shifting what is owed on a losing property to a winning one. In this way the investor can harvest losses for use against other income while continuing to own the winner.\par \par \uc2 Several experts said they believe Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  benefited from provisions allowing real-estate developers to take big losses on highly-leveraged properties.\par \par \uc2 "The leverage has to be massive, massive" in the transactions that generated his losses, said Martin McMahon Jr., a tax law professor at the University of Florida. In part, these experts said, that is because they couldn't imagine such large losses coming solely from operating losses at his businesses.\par \par \uc2 The $916 million in net operating losses -- listed on Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's state tax returns that were sent to the \uc2 New York Times\uc2  -- was a remarkable 1.9% of all NOLs claimed by individuals in 1995, according to \uc2 Alan Cole\uc2 , an economist with the \uc2 Tax Foundation\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 "Losses of this magnitude don't come from mismanaging a casino for a couple of years," said Edward Kleinbard, a tax professor at the University of Southern California law school. Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  "generated an enormous [net operating loss deduction] for himself by losing other people's money."\par \par \uc2 Congress adopted changes during the 1990s that made it somewhat easier for real-estate professionals to take advantage of leveraged losses, without having to claim income from the cancellation of debt that typically accompanies write-downs of loans.\par \par \uc2 However, it is still unclear whether -- and to what extent -- Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  might have relied on those rules.\par \par \uc2 And all this doesn't mean that Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  did anything illegal. The basic policy allowing deduction of net operating losses over multiple years has stirred little controversy until now. It is viewed as a way of supporting businesses through the ups and downs of economic cycles.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=wjco20161004000085"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document J000000020161004eca400033\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw272\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4080\pichgoal600

\par\par \b \uc2 Election\uc2  2016: \uc2 Trump\uc2  Charity Told To Halt Fundraising\b0\par\par\uc2 By Jacob Gershman and Joshua Jamerson   \par \uc2 546 \uc2 words\par \uc2 4 October 2016\par \uc2 The Wall Street Journal\par \uc2 J\par A5\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 The New York attorney general's office has demanded that \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2 's charitable foundation suspend fundraising activity in the state, issuing a cease-and-desist letter accusing the Republican presidential nominee's personal nonprofit of violating registration requirements.\par \par \uc2 Eric Schneiderman, a Democrat, notified the \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2  Foundation\uc2  Friday that it failed to register as an organization that solicits or receives charitable contributions in New York. The notification was made public Monday.\par \par \uc2 Under New York law, nonprofits as large as the \uc2 Trump\uc2  Foundation are required to declare their status as a fundraising organization as soon as they raise $25,000 in New York from state residents or entities within a reporting year.\par \par \uc2 The foundation is currently registered as a non-fundraising entity. The attorney general, whose office regulates charities operating in the state, cited a foundation benefit for veterans held in January -- which raised close to $1.7 million online -- as evidence that it crossed the threshold. The organization's recent federal tax filings also show hundreds of thousand of dollars a year in contributions from New York-based donors. As of the end of 2014, the foundation had under $1.3 million in assets.\par \par \uc2 Hope Hicks, spokeswoman for the \uc2 Trump\uc2  campaign, said Monday: "While we remain very concerned about the political motives behind AG Schneiderman's investigation, the \uc2 Trump\uc2  Foundation nevertheless intends to cooperate fully with the investigation."\par \par \uc2 Because it is an "ongoing legal matter," she said the foundation wouldn't comment further.\par \par \uc2 The foundation has 15 days from Sept. 30 -- the day the notice was dated -- to correct its registration and file required paperwork. Failure to do so would be deemed a "continuing fraud upon the people of the state of New York," the notification said.\par \par \uc2 Scrutiny of the foundation that bears Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's name has grown in the final stretch of the presidential campaign. A report in The \uc2 Washington Post\uc2  in September said Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  stopped donating to the foundation after 2008.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Schneiderman's office says it is conducting a wider investigation into the foundation, looking at whether it has complied with rules restricting revenues from flowing to directors or officers.\par \par \uc2 Last month, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's campaign provided new details about the tax he paid after the foundation made an improper gift to a group connected with Florida's attorney general in 2013, just as \uc2 Trump\uc2  University was facing potential legal scrutiny by that office. The \uc2 Trump\uc2  campaign said the donation was an inadvertent mistake.\par \par \uc2 Experts on nonprofit and charity law say it isn't uncommon for the New York attorney general's office to issue a cease-and-desist letter to a charity. Such a letter doesn't have the force of law: Mr. Schneiderman's office would need a court order to enforce its demand. A spokesman for the attorney general said the office was "not currently seeking an injunction."\par \par \uc2 Typically, when the office issues a compliance notice to a charity, the group can quickly resolve the matter by amending its status and back-filing any required financial statements, according to Seth Perlman, a New York attorney who advises nonprofit boards and represents nonprofit trade associations.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=wjco20161004000080"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document J000000020161004eca40002y\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw272\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4080\pichgoal600

\par\par \b \uc2 Election\uc2  2016: Debate to Highlight Sharp Policy Splits --- Pence and Kaine differ on a range of issues, from the health-care law to immigration\b0\par\par\uc2 By Reid J. Epstein   \par \uc2 646 \uc2 words\par \uc2 4 October 2016\par \uc2 The Wall Street Journal\par \uc2 J\par A5\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 In their first debate, the presidential nominees veered far away from substantive differences and into personal bickering.\par \par \uc2 That likely won't be the case with their running mates, who will meet Tuesday for the only vice-presidential debate of 2016.\par \par \uc2 Indiana Gov. Mike Pence, the Republican, and Virginia Sen. Tim Kaine, the Democrat, have political records that are diametrically opposed, reflect the mainstream of their respective parties and could bring out sharp contrasts. The 90-minute debate will be moderated by Elaine Quijano of \uc2 CBS News\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Mr. Kaine, a former governor, is for the minimum-wage increase that presidential nominee \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  has advocated, while Mr. Pence is opposed. Mr. Pence would rescind the Affordable Care Act, while Mr. Kaine wouldn't. Mr. Pence, since joining the GOP ticket, has defended presidential nominee \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2 's proposals to build a wall on the Mexican border and deport illegal immigrants. Mr. Kaine opposes both measures.\par \par \uc2 While vice-presidential debates can at times produce a memorable moment, they typically don't substantially shift the dynamics of a race.\par \par \uc2 "The challenge for both of them is to make absolutely no news," said Michael B. Murphy, a former Indiana Republican state legislator who has known Mr. Pence since his first run for Congress, in 1988.\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 Clinton\uc2  campaign has largely trained its policy attacks on Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  and ignored his running mate, while the GOP nominee features in his stump speech an attack on Mr. Kaine for proposing what Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  has called a "$4 billion tax increase."\par \par \uc2 During his term as Virginia's governor, Mr. Kaine sought to plug the state's budget holes with tax increases. To pay for transportation infrastructure, Mr. Kaine proposed in 2006 raising state taxes on new vehicle purchases, auto insurance and registration fees to raise $1 billion a year.\par \par \uc2 The Richmond Times-Dispatch in July noted that a portion of the revenue would have come from boosting traffic ticket fines.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Kaine, as he was leaving office in December 2009, proposed raising all of Virginia's income-tax brackets by 1 percentage point. The Republican-controlled Virginia legislature killed that idea after he left office. But Mr. Kaine also eliminated Virginia's estate tax and signed an income-tax cut during his four-year term.\par \par \uc2 Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  opposes eliminating the federal estate tax, while Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  has said he would repeal it.\par \par \uc2 On social issues, the vice-presidential hopefuls have adopted different positions. Mr. Pence, a former House member who for years has described himself in speeches as "a Christian, a conservative and a Republican, in that order," emerged in early 2015 as the champion of Indiana's "religious freedom" law that was widely criticized for allowing business owners to deny services to people because of their religious opposition to a customer's sexual orientation.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Pence initially defended the law, arguing it didn't offer a "license to discriminate." But after a week of intense pressure from corporate leaders in Indiana, Mr. Pence and Republicans who control the state legislature enacted a new version of the law that specified that business owners couldn't deny services. Mr. Pence has since been criticized by some leading social conservatives.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Kaine, who is Catholic, endorsed same-sex marriage in 2013, two months after his Senate swearing-in and well after President \uc2 Barack Obama\uc2 , Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  and other leading Democrats.\par \par \uc2 Both men have altered their position on trade policy upon being named running mate. Messrs. Pence and Kaine each backed the Trans-Pacific Partnership, though each has rescinded their support in recent months to align with Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  and Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , who both oppose the Pacific Rim trade pact.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=wjco20161004000078"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document J000000020161004eca40002w\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw272\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4080\pichgoal600

\par\par \b \uc2 Election\uc2  2016 --- CAPITAL JOURNAL: Why \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  Gets Pulled Off Course\b0\par\par\uc2 By Gerald F. Seib   \par \uc2 836 \uc2 words\par \uc2 4 October 2016\par \uc2 The Wall Street Journal\par \uc2 J\par A4\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 You could argue \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  had the strongest 30 minutes of his presidential campaign at the beginning of the first presidential debate, when he delivered a direct and succinct summary of his argument that U.S. jobs are being shipped overseas by trade deals and big-business defections and can be lured back.\par \par \uc2 And then . . .\par \par \uc2 Well, after those opening minutes, the debate shifted to his comments about women and why he pursued for years the debunked assertion that President \uc2 Barack Obama\uc2  was born overseas. In the days since, the focus has been, bizarrely, on how he assailed weight gains by a Miss Universe and, more substantively, the performance and tax treatment of his businesses. It culminated in a Saturday night rally in which, among other things, he mocked unkindly the way \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  walked to her car while suffering a bout of pneumonia.\par \par \uc2 Since about 9:30 last Monday night, in short, the campaign agenda has been more or less the kind the \uc2 Clinton\uc2  campaign would have wanted.\par \par \uc2 This is a recurring pattern in Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's world, raising the question of how it keeps happening -- and whether it is destined to continue happening over the next five weeks.\par \par \uc2 The usual explanations are that the candidate lacks the self-discipline to avoid being lured down dead-end alleys, and has a temperament that allows him to be baited into self-defeating controversies. There is obvious credence to both arguments, though they also held true while the same style was succeeding during the GOP primary season.\par \par \uc2 But there are two other, more subtle explanations for this pattern. The first is that Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  has over time planted some time bombs in his own pathway that now are starting to go off. The most obvious has to do with his tax returns. The conversation now under way -- what the returns show about his actual income, what they might show about his business empire, the amount of federal taxes he has or hasn't paid -- would have been better held five months before the \uc2 election\uc2 , not five weeks before the \uc2 election\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  decided, though, to resist calls then, not from Democrats but from fellow Republicans, to release his returns. Now the conversation is being driven instead by a leak to the \uc2 New York Times\uc2 , timely or untimely depending on your point of view, of portions of his 1995 return showing a staggering business loss of almost a billion dollars, providing a tax carryforward that likely reduced or eliminated his federal tax liability in the years since. Calmly explaining that would have been difficult months ago, but it's twice as difficult in the general-\uc2 election\uc2  hothouse.\par \par \uc2 As a consequence, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  now gets the worst of both worlds on the tax front. The presumption is that he's paid very little in federal income taxes for the past decade, while still suffering from the perception that he may be hiding something else by not releasing the returns.\par \par \uc2 The same time-bomb phenomenon is at work, on a lesser scale, with some of the cruder comments and scenes from Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's past and his primary-season campaign. One thing is certain: The \uc2 Clinton\uc2  campaign knows how to take advantage.\par \par \uc2 The second, more subtle explanation is that he may be paying the price now for not having a fully-formed policy platform. The long stretches in a one-on-one debate, and the long open spaces in a general-\uc2 election\uc2  campaign, can be filled either with these kinds of controversies, or with more serious policy conversations.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  has the outlines of a platform that has special resonance with many voters in the current climate of economic uncertainty and anger. It says that what the experts have claimed about the effects of trade deals and immigration doesn't hold water for a lot of working-class Americans, and that special interests have benefited from Washington policy-making in a way that average Americans haven't. And he has told those average Americans that they shouldn't have to see their Social Security or Medicare benefits trimmed to deal with the fallout.\par \par \uc2 Those arguments have a visceral appeal to many voters, and on a couple of fronts -- notably taxes and energy -- he has fleshed them out with detailed policy meat. But others remain vague or incomplete with details rarely discussed. So after the top lines are laid out, say in a 90-minute debate, the empty spaces tend to get filled in with discussions of the ideal weight of a Miss Universe.\par \par \uc2 All of which raises the question of whether it would be better now for Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  to do what some of his allies are suggesting, which is to turn the focus to \uc2 Bill \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's marital infidelities -- or to go back to the more substantive points made in the first minutes of that first debate.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=wjco20161004000053"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document J000000020161004eca400027\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw272\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4080\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 Global View\par \b \uc2 The Apology of \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\b0\par\par\uc2 By Bret Stephens   \par \uc2 997 \uc2 words\par \uc2 4 October 2016\par \uc2 The Wall Street Journal\par \uc2 J\par A11\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 What follows is a draft of a speech \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  is scheduled to deliver Tuesday, Oct. 4 in Prescott Valley, Ariz. We haven't confirmed its authenticity because, like the rest of the corrupt media, we're totally dishonest.\par \par \uc2 Thank you, everybody, thank you. It's good to be back in Arizona. And you know we're going to win, right? The polls say we're going to win in Arizona, and we will.\par \par \uc2 The polls also say we'd lose the general \uc2 election\uc2  if it were held today. But they're wrong. So wrong. You know how pollsters work? They guess who will show up to vote on \uc2 election\uc2  day, and then they poll these "likely voters."\par \par \uc2 But let me tell you something. The pollsters have no clue. None. They don't have a clue who the electorate is, and they don't have a clue of what's going on in America. Believe me, folks, on \uc2 election\uc2  day they're going to find out.\par \par \uc2 The other day, in Colombia -- I'm talking about the country in South America -- they held a vote. A referendum. President Santos staked his reputation on a, quote-unquote, peace deal with the terrorists of \uc2 the FARC\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Now \uc2 the FARC\uc2 , they're the worst people in the world. They've killed tens of thousands of people. They make their money through drug trafficking and kidnapping. They've been terrorizing Colombians for 50 years.\par \par \uc2 Along comes Santos, and he makes this terrible deal that says to \uc2 the FARC\uc2 : We're not going to send you to jail. We're going to sentence your leaders to community service. We're even going to guarantee you seats in the Congress.\par \par \uc2 And all the polls said the deal was going to win in a landslide. Obama and Kerry lined up behind it. Santos told Colombians they had no choice, that it was the only road to peace.\par \par \uc2 Guess what? The polls were wrong. The Colombians knew a bad deal when they saw one. They weren't going to let killers get away with their crimes. The only deal they want with \uc2 the FARC\uc2  is the same deal Reagan got from Russia: We win, they lose.\par \par \uc2 Folks, it was the same story with the Brexit vote in June. All the polls said the Brits wouldn't vote to leave the \uc2 European Union\uc2 . They did. All the experts said the sky would fall if the Brits voted to go. It didn't. These geniuses said that Britain was too small to be the master of its own destiny. The British people believe otherwise, and I'm with them!\par \par \uc2 What happened in Britain, in Colombia, it's going to happen here. Because, like them, we're sick of it.\par \par \uc2 We're sick of hearing ObamaCare is working when even the \uc2 New York Times\par \par \uc2 admits it's a total disaster. We're sick of hearing how great the economy is when it's floating on a big wave of cheap credit that benefits Wall Street at the expense of savers. We're sick of hearing how great the Iran deal is, then watching our sailors being humiliated while we secretly fork over pallets of cash.\par \par \uc2 You know what we're also sick of? Liberal hypocrites.\par \par \uc2 I'm not supposed to say the name I'm about to say. Well, two words: Alicia. Machado.\par \par \uc2 Who is this Alicia Machado, other than a political prop for Hillary? She was a beauty queen for a business I helped run called "Miss Universe." The business of beauty queens is to be beautiful, just like it's the business of athletes to be fit. Duh! And when she gained some weight, I insisted she lose it. Did I call her "Miss Piggy"? Boo hoo. Get over it.\par \par \uc2 For this I'm being treated very badly. Let me ask you something: Other than Lena Dunham, when was the last time Anna Wintour ran a fat person on the cover of \uc2 Vogue\uc2 ? And when was the last time Hillary said no to one of Ms. Wintour's big fundraisers because of \uc2 Vogue\uc2 's "lookism"?\par \par \uc2 So spare me the sensitivity lectures. Spare me the business lectures, too. Those tax returns someone stole and the \uc2 New York Times\uc2  published? The ones that showed I once lost nearly a billion dollars and used every legal trick in the book to stage a comeback?\par \par \uc2 All of you here understand this is how business is done in America. Some years you make money. Some years you lose. You take advantage of every tax break you can because the government is trying to screw you every other way.\par \par \uc2 That's the real world. It's only in the unreal world that Hillary lives in that you can make a fortune by being a failed secretary of state and then cash in on obscene speaking fees, or arrange for Bill to get an $18 million salary to be "honorary chancellor" at a for-profit college while the Obama administration destroys every other for-profit. That's called corruption, no matter whether it's legal or not.\par \par \uc2 Folks, there's a giant wave coming. A tsunami of Americans who won't stand for being told we don't know what's good for us. Who refuse to be lectured by political grifters about how to make an honest buck. Who don't need our morals improved by Hillary Macbeth and Billy Caligula. And who refuse to accept that we have to make lousy deals, or make do with less, or that America can't ever be great again.\par \par \uc2 To all the liberals and Never Trumpers who don't get why Hillary isn't ahead by 50 points -- I just explained it. To all of you, get ready for Nov. 8. It's going to be a beautiful thing. Believe me.\par \par \uc2 ---\par \par \uc2 Write bstephens@wsj.com.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=wjco20161004000039"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document J000000020161004eca40001t\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw272\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4080\pichgoal600

\par\par \b \uc2 Keywords: \uc2 Facebook\uc2  's Big Role in 2016 \uc2 Election\b0\par\par\uc2 By Christopher Mims   \par \uc2 723 \uc2 words\par \uc2 3 October 2016\par \uc2 The Wall Street Journal\par \uc2 J\par B1\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 Citigroup Inc\uc2  . projects that spending on political ads on \uc2 Facebook Inc\uc2  . could surpass spending on \uc2 Alphabet Inc\uc2  .'s \uc2 Google\uc2  this year, reversing the historical pattern. This is no small accomplishment, considering how powerful search advertising remains, as a conduit for motivated donors and volunteers.\par \par \uc2 This reflects both \uc2 Facebook\uc2  's vast reach and the tools it offers advertisers to target ever-narrower segments of its users. For campaigns striving to get supporters to the polls, as well as change minds, this ability to "micro-target" is manna from heaven. As with conventional advertising, it is now happening with unprecedented scale and precision in politics.\par \par \uc2 Even Republican presidential hopeful \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  , who once called data "overrated" as a political tool, appears to have seen the light. One day in August, his campaign sprayed ads at \uc2 Facebook\uc2  users that led to 100,000 different webpages, each micro-targeted at a different segment of voters, said Brad Parscale, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's digital director and head of San Antonio-based digital advertising firm Giles-Parscale. \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  's campaign is using similar tactics, said a campaign official.\par \par \uc2 In an ideal world, campaigns would poll every voter in America, then craft strategies to persuade undecideds and motivate supporters to go to the polls, said Sasha Issenberg, a journalist who has written about the science of winning campaigns. Campaigns haven't reached this point yet, but they are coming close.\par \par \uc2 Cambridge Analytica LLC, a data-science firm known for its psychological profiles of voters, is now working with Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , after working with Sen. Ted Cruz during the primaries.\par \par \uc2 Chief Data Officer Alexander Tayler says the firm has a database of 220 million U.S. adults with 4,000 to 5,000 data points on each. Cambridge Analytica can connect this database to vast quantities of other data -- from voter-registration records to databases of shopping patterns and gun ownership -- from consumer data brokers such as \uc2 Experian PLC\uc2  and \uc2 Acxiom Corp\uc2  .\par \par \uc2 Facebook\uc2  has made similar tools accessible to anyone with a credit card. The social network's role in influencing political attitudes has been much discussed. But \uc2 Facebook\uc2  's increasingly important role as a campaign advertising medium has gotten much less attention.\par \par \uc2 "Everybody thought 2008 was the \uc2 Facebook\uc2 election\uc2 , but I'd argue 2016 is the \uc2 Facebook\uc2 election\uc2 ," says Zac Moffatt, former digital director for \uc2 Mitt Romney\uc2  's presidential campaign and co-founder of political consultancy Targeted Victory. "\uc2 Facebook\uc2  's real value is in its size and scale. . . .It's that you can hit three out of four Americans on one platform."\par \par \uc2 Several Facebook moves to help advertisers target their audience more precisely appeal particularly to political campaigns. Its "custom audiences" tool allows advertisers to reach a specified list of users, such as a group of supporters; both the Obama and Romney campaigns used custom audiences in 2012.\par \par \uc2 Facebook\uc2  also allows advertisers, including even local campaigns, to plug in data from data brokers, just as Cambridge Analytica and other firms do. And its "look-alike audiences" allows advertisers to reach people who are like those in a known group. Think of a Spotify service for finding potential supporters who look like known supporters.\par \par \uc2 Analysts from Borrell Associates estimate that about $1 billion will be spent on digital ads this \uc2 election\uc2  cycle.\par \par \uc2 That is still a fraction of the $4.4 billion Kantar's Campaign Media and Analysis Group expects to be spent on TV, but the digital total is up more than threefold from 2012.\par \par \uc2 The spending, and candidates' ability to target \uc2 Facebook\uc2  ads with different messages to different voters, worry Cathy O'Neil, author of "Weapons of Math Destruction," a book about the dangers of ceding control to opaque algorithms.\par \par \uc2 "What's efficient for campaigns is to decide what bit of information is given to a given voter on \uc2 Facebook\uc2  and \uc2 Google\uc2  ," said Ms. O'Neil. "But in that case what is efficient for campaigns is inefficient for democracy."\par \par \uc2 Politicians, and their aides, are plunging ahead, however.\par \par \uc2 "Conventional political wisdom has been destroyed by data science and the hard quantities of facts," said Mr. Tayler, of Cambridge Analytica.\par \par \uc2 Microtargeting is important, according to the same \uc2 Clinton\uc2  campaign official, who cautions, however, that targeting can't replace a candidate's message.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=wjco20161003000027"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document J000000020161003eca30000i\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw272\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4080\pichgoal600

\par\par \b \uc2 Election\uc2  2016: \uc2 Clinton\uc2  Gains Ground with Older Voters\b0\par\par\uc2 By Michael C. Bender   \par \uc2 687 \uc2 words\par \uc2 3 October 2016\par \uc2 The Wall Street Journal\par \uc2 J\par A4\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 DELRAY BEACH, Fla. -- Ruth Mary Baudhuin watched Lawrence Welk as a young girl, listened to fellow Philadelphian Chubby Checker on the radio, and eventually grew into her parents' Republicanism, an Irish-Catholic conservatism that idealized the nuclear family.\par \par \uc2 But the 68-year-old retiree, like many older voters, no longer recognizes her party. The soft-edged promise she recalls of previous nominees -- Ronald Reagan's sunny disposition, \uc2 John McCain\uc2  's undisputed patriotism -- have been replaced with what she views as insults and bombast.\par \par \uc2 So she's backing Democratic nominee \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  , ending her streak of supporting every Republican presidential nominee since \uc2 Gerald Ford\uc2  . "The main thing is I really don't like the person," said Mrs. Baudhuin, now a Florida voter, barely able to speak GOP nominee \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  's name and relying instead on pronouns. "His attitudes, all the negative things he puts out, I really don't want a racist to be president."\par \par \uc2 Mrs. Baudhuin's change of heart isn't an anomaly when it comes to America's oldest -- and most reliable -- voters.Among voters 65 and older, the most recent round of major media polls show Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  running between 11 and 18 percentage points behind 2012 GOP nominee \uc2 Mitt Romney\uc2  at this same point four years ago.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Romney went on to win the older vote by 12 percentage points -- the largest margin for any presidential candidate in 28 years -- and still lost to President \uc2 Barack Obama\uc2  .\par \par \uc2 "It's disconcerting, because seniors have been the core of our base in recent years," Republican pollster \uc2 Ed Goeas\uc2  said, adding that private polling shows similar trends.\par \par \uc2 Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  has her own demographic dilemma, as her campaign works feverishly to energize the nation's youngestvoters, who overwhelmingly backed Mr. Obama four years ago. Many in this group now are considering support for third-party candidates.\par \par \uc2 Yet the biggest partisan shift this year may be America's older citizens.\par \par \uc2 Until recently, voters who are 65 and older have been trending Republican. No Democratic presidential candidate has won older voters since Al Gore in 2000, exit polls show. And for the past five \uc2 election\uc2  cycles, every Republican nominee has won a larger share of this bloc than his predecessor.\par \par \uc2 Now, Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  appears to be luring them back to her party's fold.She was winning among older voters, 44% to 42%, among registered voters in the latest Wall Street Journal poll.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  had a three percentage point advantage among older voters in the New York Times/CBS poll on Sept. 11, but that lagged well behind Mr. Romney's lead of 15 percentage points in the same poll at this point in the race four years ago.\par \par \uc2 "I know there's a lot of questions about him," said Pat Boone, the 82-year-old singer who is advising the \uc2 Trump\uc2  campaign. "He shoots from the lip, and I regret that. But there are no perfect people, even among the saints."\par \par \uc2 Mr. Boone will serve as a national co-chair on a senior advisory committee the \uc2 Trump\uc2  campaign will unveil soon, according to a campaign aide.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  once supported Social Security privatization and increasing the age to receive benefits. But these efforts will remind older voters that he now supports eliminating the estate tax, which Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  opposes, and that he broke from leaders in his own party by vowing to protect Social Security and Medicare, as has Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  sat for an interview for the \uc2 election\uc2  preview issue of AARP's newsletter, and submitted written answers to 13 questions. Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  declined the group's interview request and answered just six of its questions.\par \par \uc2 To appeal to older voters, Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  has called for a tax credit worth $1,200 a year toward caregiving costs for elderly family members, and has also called for $2 billion a year in research to find a cure for Alzheimer's disease by 2025. That project would be underwritten partly through a tax on wealthier Americans.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=wjco20161003000040"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document J000000020161003eca30000v\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw272\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4080\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 The weekend revelation of some of \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2 's tax records put the New York real-estate developer on the defensive by showing the extent of his 1990s financial troubles and suggesting those setbacks could have eliminated his federal income-tax bill for years afterward.\par \par \uc2 Parts of Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's state tax documents from 1995, published over the weekend by the \uc2 New York Times\uc2 , show that the Republican presidential nominee reported a $916 million loss on that year's tax return. That would allow him to legally soak up years of future income, earned through his television appearances and his hotel and golf-course operations, without paying any federal income taxes.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , in response, early Sunday argued on \uc2 Twitter\uc2  he knows "our complex tax laws better than anyone who has ever run for president and am the only one who can fix them." Some of his supporters said on TV the disclosure proved Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  was an astute businessman, with former New York City Mayor \uc2 Rudy Giuliani\uc2  calling him "an absolute genius" for his use of the tax code.\par \par \uc2 The revelations about Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's taxes, following last week's lackluster debate performance and his escalation of attacks on a beauty-contest winner, left Republicans increasingly concerned he is ceding momentum to Democrat \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 . The latest revelation could increase the pressure on Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  to fill gaps in his business record, the extent of his liabilities and how he has accounted for it all in the eyes of federal tax collectors.\par \par \uc2 "The \uc2 election\uc2  is far from over. But we don't have a lot of time left -- voting begins in Ohio in 10 days," said Matt Borges, chairman of the Ohio Republican Party. "So the candidate and the campaign can't spend any more time talking about issues that don't help us win."\par \par \uc2 The big loss revealed in the filing blurs Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's campaign image as a successful New York real-estate developer. The documents also highlight the gulf between Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  and voters who have taxes withheld from their wages with little opportunity to alter the timing of their income or hire lawyers and accountants to seek the best possible outcome.\par \par \uc2 The U.S. taxes income, not wealth, and savvy taxpayers often try to avoid reporting much of the former while generating the latter. They don't usually try to do so, however, by actually losing money.\par \par \uc2 After borrowing more than $3 billion to build his business empire during the 1980s, much of it personally guaranteed, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  faced a severe financial crunch starting in 1990. That was because casinos and an airline he owned at the time didn't meet operating projections just as some of his debt was coming due. Meanwhile, a downturn in the New York City real-estate market and other factors made it hard for him to sell some assets, according to reports by New Jersey casino regulators at the time.\par \par \uc2 During this period, he worked out several restructurings with creditors that bought him time, putting him on a monthly allowance for a period. He leaned on his Atlantic City casinos in New Jersey, dragging them through bankruptcy court and then borrowing against them to pay off loans elsewhere. He took out around $160 million from the casinos during this time to pay down other debt, a Wall Street Journal analysis showed.\par \par \uc2 He finalized a deal with creditors in 1995 to wipe out the last of his personal debt.\par \par \uc2 The tax treatment of losses is a typically uncontroversial feature of the income-tax system. The government doesn't pay net refunds when business owners lose money, but it lets taxpayers use those losses to smooth their tax payments as they make money.\par \par \uc2 Typically, for federal returns, such net operating losses can be carried backward for two years to offset past income, then kept on a taxpayer's books for 20 years. Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's losses could only qualify for a 15-year carryforward under the law at the time.\par \par \uc2 Real-estate developers can generate losses more easily than other taxpayers. They can take deductions for depreciation of their property and can also deduct interest when they borrow. Unlike investors in other businesses, they can use those losses to offset other income.\par \par \uc2 It is difficult to determine whether Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  used those losses to offset all of his taxable income in subsequent years. He has reported his recent years' income on federal disclosure forms, but some of those numbers appeared to refer to total revenue, not taxable income after business expenses and deductions.\par \par \uc2 Bryan Skarlatos, a tax lawyer at \uc2 Kostelanetz & Fink LLP\uc2 , said almost all of the losses appear to predate 1995 and were carried forward to that year.\par \par \uc2 "This is all possible because \uc2 Trump\uc2  appears to have a perfect storm of allowable real-estate losses that can be offset against streams of income from salaries from his companies and royalty fees from the use of his name," Mr. Skarlatos said. "Most taxpayers who have large real-estate losses don't have such large steady streams of other ordinary income."\par \par \uc2 During the debate with Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  last week, when she cited previously available records showing he hadn't paid taxes in some years, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  said that was "smart." He is the first major-party presidential nominee since 1976 to not release his own tax returns.\par \par \uc2 Saturday's statement from the \uc2 Trump\uc2  campaign said he has paid hundreds of millions of dollars in various taxes, including "federal taxes" and "state taxes" but not specifically "federal income taxes" and "state income taxes."\par \par \uc2 The losses from the 1990s may explain some of Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's recent transactions.\par \par \uc2 Because casino records previously showed that Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  had net loss carryforwards at the end of 1993, the 1995 losses may stem from multiple years. The losses from that era are expiring or have expired and are now less available to soak up his income, even if they haven't been used up.\par \par \uc2 When that happens, a taxpayer looking to cut his tax bill would seek to lower his taxable income -- which Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  did in 2014 and 2015. In each of those years, he donated what is known as a conservation easement, essentially extracting income-tax deductions out of the properties.\par \par \uc2 ---\par \par \uc2 Alexandra Berzon contributed to this article.\par \par \uc2 (See related letters: "Letters to the Editor: \uc2 Trump\uc2 's Taxes and Tax Loss Carry-Forwards" -- WSJ Oct. 11, 2016)\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=wjco20161003000090"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document J000000020161003eca300028\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw272\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4080\pichgoal600

\par\par \b \uc2 Election\uc2  2016: An Explainer on the Tax Benefit the Nominee May Have Used\b0\par\par\uc2 By John D. McKinnon   \par \uc2 238 \uc2 words\par \uc2 3 October 2016\par \uc2 The Wall Street Journal\par \uc2 J\par A4\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 Q. Where did the concept originate to allow certain losses to be carried over to other tax years?\par \par \uc2 A. The Revenue Act of 1918 introduced the idea of allowing taxpayers to carry over net-operating losses, known as NOL, to other tax years, temporarily allowing for an NOL to be carried back one year and then forward one year. Today, carry-over periods reach 20 years; losses can be carried back two years.\par \par \uc2 Q. What's the idea behind it?\par \par \uc2 A. It lets businesses and their owners smooth out their incomes and tax bills over multiple years, giving them a better chance at long-term survival.\par \par \uc2 Q. Who tends to use it the most?\par \par \uc2 A. Cyclical businesses that can suffer heavy losses in downturns, such as consumer-goods makers. Owners of real-estate investment firms, with big interest and depreciation deductions, also can benefit. Other rules benefit real-estate investors such as Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2 , including the ability to use losses to offset other kinds of income.\par \par \uc2 Q. How controversial has this provision been in Congress?\par \par \uc2 A. There has been debate, but the basic principle of business NOL carry-over has been embraced and expanded in recent years by both parties.\par \par \uc2 (See related article: "Taxes Pose New Challenge for \uc2 Trump\uc2 " -- WSJ Oct. 3, 2016)\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=wjco20161003000043"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document J000000020161003eca30000y\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw272\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4080\pichgoal600

\par\par \b \uc2 Election\uc2  2016: Debate Roles Shift to the Understudies --- Stakes have risen for Pence, \uc2 Trump\uc2 's 'bridge' to the rest of the GOP, after last week's event\b0\par\par\uc2 By Monica Langley   \par \uc2 682 \uc2 words\par \uc2 3 October 2016\par \uc2 The Wall Street Journal\par \uc2 J\par A6\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 Mike Pence\uc2  is in many ways \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2 's opposite -- an unfailingly polite and humble establishment Republican with a full head of naturally white hair and a wife of 31 years.\par \par \uc2 "I'm kind of the B-list Republican celebrity," the vice-presidential nominee and Indiana governor told several hundred supporters in Leetonia, Ohio, last Wednesday. "I'm not the main event."\par \par \uc2 He also has far better ties to mainstream Republicans, who now are counting on him to get the better of his Democratic counterpart, Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia, on the debate stage Tuesday night. The stakes for that event have risen after Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's uneven debate performance last week against Democratic nominee \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , and after the publication of some of Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's tax records.\par \par \uc2 Much as Mr. Pence, 57 years old, is the stylistic counter to Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , he also has taken the opposite approach in preparing for that showdown. While the New York businessman said here lied mostly on instinct going into his debate, Mr. Pence said he has spent several days in 90-minute mock debates, then studied video playbacks. A friend, Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, played the part of Mr. Kaine.\par \par \uc2 "My goal is to show that Donald, a doer in a game usually reserved for talkers, will bring the bold change sought by everyday Americans voiced in their aspirations and frustrations," Mr.Pence said in an interview. "And I'll contrast what I did in Indiana to Sen. Kaine in Virginia."\par \par \uc2 Though the debate will be the most visible role Mr.Pence has played in the \uc2 election\uc2 , he has become the \uc2 Trump\uc2  ambassador to mainline Republicans and other conservatives -- even to some "Never \uc2 Trump\uc2 " donors who previously pledged to stay on the sidelines.\par \par \uc2 "Mike is a committed conservative and perfect bridge" to segments of the Republican Party who were "excited and relieved" with Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's vice-presidential choice, said House Speaker \uc2 Paul Ryan\uc2 , who has expressed some misgivings about Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Elected to the House in 2000, Mr. Pence rose to a GOP leadership position before leaving Congress in 2012 when he was elected governor. As he began a tough race for re-\uc2 election\uc2  this year, Mr.Pencegot the call from the \uc2 Trump\uc2  camp asking if he would consider the vice-presidential slot.\par \par \uc2 Since winning the No. 2 spot on the ticket, Mr. Pence has held private meetings with other 2016 contenders -- often in their home states while he is on the trail. He also has visited Capitol Hill for intense chats with some lawmakers who have voiced concerns about Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , such as Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and GOP Sen. Jeff Flake of Arizona.\par \par \uc2 At campaign rallies, Mr.Pence sticks to his script, written on big note cards. Most of them were crinkled and ink-smeared from a drenching rain when he spoke two weeks ago in historic Williamsburg, Va., where a crowd of 700, without umbrellas because of Secret Service rules, stayed for 45 minutes.\par \par \uc2 Lately, Mr.Pence has spent less time campaigning and more time on debate prep, including familiarizing himself with the record of Mr. Kaine, a former governor of Virginia. "He tried to raise taxes, and I lowered taxes every year," Mr. Pence said, previewing a likely line.\par \par \uc2 Meantime, Mr. Pence is working the campaign-contribution circuit. Unlike Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , who doesn't enjoy making small talk or asking for help, his running mate is comfortable at fundraising events and insoliciting donations from the trail.\par \par \uc2 Back at the Ohio rally on Wednesday, Mr.Pence tried to convince the crowd that despite their outward differences, "\uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  and I have a lot in common" -- except, he added, for "a lot of zeros" in Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's net worth.\par \par \uc2 (See related article: "Kaine's popularity in Virginia has allowed \uc2 Clinton\uc2  to focus on other swing states" -- WSJ October 3, 2016)\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=wjco20161003000107"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document J000000020161003eca30002p\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 Foreign Desk; SECTA\par \b \uc2 Pope Praises Azerbaijan's Religious Tolerance, Avoiding a Touchy Topic\b0\par\par\uc2 By JIM YARDLEY \par \uc2 878 \uc2 words\par \uc2 3 October 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 6\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 BAKU, Azerbaijan -- Pope Francis on Sunday finished his visit to the conflict-torn Caucasus region with a stop in Azerbaijan, a predominantly Shiite Muslim country, where he pleaded with leaders of all religious faiths to leave future generations ''a better world than the one we have received.''\par \par \uc2 Francis praised Azerbaijan as a place of religious tolerance as he met privately with Sheikh ul-Islam, the region's grand mufti, before the two men held an interreligious meeting at the country's largest mosque with Orthodox Christian, Muslim and Jewish leaders. Alluding to wars in the region, Francis called on religions to ''be active agents working to overcome the tragedies of the past and the tensions of the present.''\par \par \uc2 But Francis was silent about the Azerbaijan government's much-criticized record on civil liberties, human rights and fair elections. Human rights groups have documented numerous abuses, including the imprisonment of journalists and political dissidents, the disbarment of human rights lawyers and a crackdown on civil society groups.\par \par \uc2 Francis expounded on a few unrelated topics during his customary news conference onboard the papal airliner during the return trip to Rome, including the American presidential \uc2 election\uc2  and the issue of gender identity.\par \par \uc2 Asked how he would advise American Catholics in an \uc2 election\uc2  in which both major candidates diverge from some Catholic teachings -- the Republican nominee, Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , has vilified immigrants and religious minorities -- Francis recommended that voters study the candidates' concrete proposals, pray ''and choose in conscience.''\par \par \uc2 Regarding his remarks a day earlier, when he criticized ''gender theory,'' Francis said he disapproved of schools or textbooks that ''indoctrinate'' the belief that gender is something a person can choose or change. But he added that the role of a good priest is to accompany someone struggling with these feelings -- not to abandon or condemn the person. He also said Jesus would not turn such people away.\par \par \uc2 He noted that last year, he received a letter from a Spaniard who had undergone female-to-male gender reassignment surgery and who later married a woman. The man asked the pope if the couple could visit him at the Vatican, and Francis agreed. ''I received them,'' he said. ''They were happy.''\par \par \uc2 Francis' short visit, about 10 hours, to oil-rich Azerbaijan was the final stop in his bifurcated tour of the Caucasus, which began with a June visit to Armenia. He returned over the weekend to spend two days in Georgia before arriving on Sunday morning in Baku, the capital of Azerbaijan at the edge of the Caspian Sea.\par \par \uc2 In visiting the Caucasus, Francis waded into a region troubled by rivalries and conflict, but one with geopolitical importance as a historical crossroads between East and West. Georgian leaders lobbied Francis over their efforts to reclaim territory now under the control of separatist groups supported by Russia. In Armenia and Azerbaijan, he was pulled in opposite directions in their long conflict over the region of Nagorno-Karabakh.\par \par \uc2 During his visit to Armenia, Francis promised to talk to the Azeris about how to find a peaceful solution to the conflict over the Nagorno-Karabakh region, and told reporters on that trip back to Rome that ''not making peace on account of a small patch of land -- because that is all it is -- means something grim.'' Some Azeri analysts saw that comment as belittling a dispute that has displaced large numbers of people.\par \par \uc2 ''Our people have faced a humanitarian catastrophe,'' President Ilham Aliyev said Sunday afternoon during an appearance with the pope.\par \par \uc2 Francis stuck with broad calls for dialogue, urging the international community to help mediate, describing himself as ''a pilgrim for peace'' in the region and expressing ''my heartfelt closeness to those who have had to leave their land and to the many people who suffer the effects of bloody conflicts.''\par \par \uc2 His silence on the Aliyev administration's record on civil liberties and human rights was noticeable, if perhaps not surprising. He is usually careful to avoid direct criticisms of a government during his international trips, though he does regularly make implicit criticisms.\par \par \uc2 The Roman Catholic Church, officially granted legal recognition by the Azeri government in 2011, has fewer than 300 native followers.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Aliyev has faced heavy international criticism for cracking down on free speech and political dissent. One high-profile case involved the journalist Khadija Ismayilova, who was sentenced to prison on tax evasion charges after reporting on corruption in the Aliyev government. With a big international campaign on her behalf, Ms. Ismayilova was released in May after the case became embarrassing for Mr. Aliyev, though she is still serving a suspended sentence.\par \par \uc2 What Francis did want to emphasize was the country's embrace of religious diversity at a time when the Islamic State is slaughtering people in Syria and persecuting Christians and other non-Muslims.\par \par \uc2 ''We see the growing emergence of rigid and fundamentalist reactions on the part of those who, through violent words and deeds, seek to impose extreme and radical attitudes which are furthest from the living God,'' he said.\par \par \uc2 Pope Francis prayed at a monument for the fallen in Baku, Azerbaijan, during a visit to promote interfaith harmony on Sunday.

\par\par \uc2 National Desk; SECTA\par \b \uc2 Next President Likely to Shape Health Law Fate\b0\par\par\uc2 By ROBERT PEAR \par \uc2 1,408 \uc2 words\par \uc2 3 October 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 1\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 WASHINGTON -- The fierce struggle to enact and carry out the Affordable Care Act was supposed to put an end to 75 years of fighting for a health care system to insure all Americans. Instead, the law's troubles could make it just a way station on the road to another, more stable health care system, the shape of which could be determined on \uc2 Election\uc2  Day.\par \par \uc2 Seeing a lack of competition in many of the health law's online insurance marketplaces, \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , President Obama and much of the Democratic Party are calling for more government, not less.\par \par \uc2 The departing president, the woman who seeks to replace him and nearly one-third of the Senate have endorsed a new government-sponsored health plan, the so-called public option, to give consumers an additional choice. A significant number of Democrats, for whom Senator Bernie Sanders spoke in the primaries, favor a single-payer arrangement, which could take the form of Medicare for all.\par \par \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2  and Republicans in Congress would go in the direction of less government, reducing federal regulation and requirements so insurance would cost less and no-frills options could proliferate. Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  would, for example, encourage greater use of health savings accounts, allow insurance policies to be purchased across state lines and let people take tax deductions for insurance premium payments.\par \par \uc2 In such divergent proposals lies an emerging truth: Mr. Obama's signature domestic achievement will almost certainly have to change to survive. The two parties agree that for too many people, health plans in the individual insurance market are still too expensive and inaccessible.\par \par \uc2 ''Employer markets are fairly stable, but the individual insurance market does not feel stable at all,'' said Janet S. Trautwein, the chief executive of the National Association of Health Underwriters, which represents more than 100,000 agents and brokers who specialize in health insurance. ''In many states, the individual market is in a shambles.''\par \par \uc2 Mr. Obama himself, while boasting that 20 million people had gained coverage because of the law, acknowledged in July that ''more work to reform the health care system is necessary.''\par \par \uc2 ''Too many Americans still strain to pay for their physician visits and prescriptions, cover their deductibles or pay their monthly insurance bills; struggle to navigate a complex, sometimes bewildering system; and remain uninsured,'' Mr. Obama wrote in The Journal of the \uc2 American Medical Association\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 The marketplace faces a major test in the fourth annual open enrollment season, which starts on Nov. 1, a week before \uc2 Election\uc2  Day. In many counties, consumers will see higher premiums and fewer insurers, as \uc2 Aetna\uc2 , \uc2 Humana\uc2  and \uc2 UnitedHealth\uc2  have curtailed their participation in the exchanges, and many of the nonprofit insurance cooperatives, created with federal money, have shut down.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  has said that Congress must ''completely repeal Obamacare,'' and Republicans in Congress have repeatedly tried to do so. But parts of the law appear to be here to stay. One such provision, now widely accepted, says that insurers cannot deny coverage because of a person's medical condition or history.\par \par \uc2 For their part, many Democrats are clamoring for a public insurance option, as they did nine years ago.\par \par \uc2 ''Supporters of the public option warned that private insurance companies could not be trusted to provide reliable coverage or control costs,'' said Richard J. Kirsch, who led a grass-roots organization that fought for passage of the Affordable Care Act in 2009 and 2010. ''The shrinking number of health insurers is proof that these warnings were spot on.''\par \par \uc2 On Sept. 15, Senator Jeff Merkley, Democrat of Oregon, introduced a resolution calling for a public option. The measure now has 32 co-sponsors, including the top Senate Democrats: Harry Reid of Nevada, Chuck Schumer of New York and Richard J. Durbin of Illinois.\par \par \uc2 ''You need competition to make the exchanges successful,'' Mr. Merkley said in an interview. ''A public option guarantees there's competition in each and every exchange around the country.''\par \par \uc2 As they did before the Affordable Care Act was enacted, insurance lobbyists are mobilizing to kill the public option. The main trade group for the industry, \uc2 America's Health Insurance Plans\uc2 , says it would do nothing to stabilize the exchanges, and in an urgent ''action alert,'' the group asked member companies to lobby against Mr. Merkley's resolution.\par \par \uc2 Senator Lamar Alexander, Republican of Tennessee and chairman of the Senate health committee, said the Democrats' public option plan would compound the problems it seeks to solve.\par \par \uc2 ''Obamacare exchanges are collapsing because of federal mandates and a lack of flexibility,'' Mr. Alexander said. ''We need to give states more flexibility and individuals more choices so more people can buy low-cost insurance.''\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  would replace the Affordable Care Act with an assortment of conservative policies, including some that are similar to ideas favored by House Republicans and by think tanks like \uc2 the Heritage Foundation\uc2  or the \uc2 American Enterprise Institute\uc2 . But Democrats and some Republicans say that Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  has not laid out a comprehensive, coherent alternative to the Affordable Care Act.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  would eliminate the requirement that most Americans carry health insurance. He would encourage the sale of insurance across state lines, in a bid to increase competition. And he would convert Medicaid, now an open-ended entitlement, into a block grant, giving each state a lump sum of federal money to provide health care to low-income people.\par \par \uc2 The basic structure of the Affordable Care Act looked promising to private insurers. The government, in effect, required consumers to buy their products and provided subsidies to help defray the cost, under an arrangement that had few precedents in other industries.\par \par \uc2 A public option could take market share from private insurers, so it is no surprise they would oppose it. But insurers say the public option would not hold down medical costs, which they describe as the main engine driving up premiums. Moreover, insurers say that the government would have an unfair advantage if it both regulates and competes with private plans.\par \par \uc2 For some people, the subsidies have proved inadequate. People with annual incomes less than two and half times the poverty level (less than $29,700 for an individual) receive the most generous subsidies and have signed up in large numbers.\par \par \uc2 But enrollment figures suggest that higher-income people who receive smaller subsidies or none at all have not seen insurance as such a bargain.\par \par \uc2 ''The insurance exchanges have enrolled more than 80 percent of the potential exchange population with incomes below 150 percent of the federal poverty level,'' said \uc2 Caroline F. Pearson\uc2 , a senior vice president of Avalere, a health policy consulting company. But, she added, they have enrolled only 17 percent of potential customers with incomes from three to four times the poverty level ($35,640 to $47,520 for an individual).\par \par \uc2 Andrew M. Slavitt\uc2 , the acting administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, said the administration was taking steps to ensure ''a stable, sustainable marketplace'' -- by increasing payments to insurers for ''high-cost enrollees'' and by curbing any abuse of ''special enrollment periods'' by people who sign up for coverage after they become sick. In addition, federal officials are redoubling efforts to sign up young adults.\par \par \uc2 Dr. John W. Rowe\uc2 , who was the chief executive of Aetna from 2000 to 2006 and the president of Mount Sinai Medical Center in New York before that, predicted that ''the insurance market will stabilize in two or three years.''\par \par \uc2 ''We are not in a death spiral,'' Dr. Rowe said. ''If this were a patient, I would say that he's not in intensive care, but he's still in the hospital and requires careful monitoring.''\par \par \uc2 But that does not mean the act will heal on its own, said \uc2 Sara Rosenbaum\uc2 , a professor of health law and policy at George Washington University.\par \par \uc2 ''Even the most ardent proponents of the law would say that it has structural and technical problems that need to be addressed,'' she said. ''The subsidies were not generous enough. The penalties for not getting insurance were not stiff enough. And we don't have enough young healthy people in the exchanges.''\par \par \uc2 Senator Jeff Merkley, top, Democrat of Oregon, wants to add a public option to the insurance exchanges, a plan that Senator Lamar Alexander, above, Republican of Tennessee, opposes.

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  has just had an extraordinarily bad week, and \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  an extraordinarily good one; betting markets now put Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's odds of winning almost as high as they were just after the Democratic convention. But both Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's virtues and Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's vices have been obvious all along. How, then, did the race manage to get so close on the eve of the debate?\par \par \uc2 A lot of the answer, I've argued, lies in the behavior of the news media, which spent the month before the first debate jeering at Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , portraying minor missteps as major sins and inventing fake scandals out of thin air. But let us not let everyone else off the hook. Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  couldn't have gotten as far as he has without the support, active or de facto, of many people who understand perfectly well what he is and what his \uc2 election\uc2  would mean, but have chosen not to take a stand.\par \par \uc2 Let's start with the Republican political establishment, which is supporting Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  just as if he were a normal presidential nominee.\par \par \uc2 I've had a lot of critical things to say about Mitch McConnell, the Senate majority leader, and \uc2 Paul Ryan\uc2 , the speaker of the House. One thing of which I would never accuse them, however, is stupidity. They know what kind of man they're dealing with -- but they are spending this \uc2 election\uc2  pretending that we're having a serious discussion about policy, that a vote for Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  is simply a vote for lower marginal tax rates. And they should not be allowed to flush the fact of their \uc2 Trump\uc2  support down the memory hole when the \uc2 election\uc2  is behind us.\par \par \uc2 This goes in particular for Mr. Ryan, who has received extraordinarily favorable press treatment over the years -- portrayed as an honest, serious policy wonk with a sincere concern for fiscal probity. This reputation was never deserved; his policy proposals have always been obvious flimflam. But in the past, criticisms of Mr. Ryan depended on pointing out hard stuff, like the fact that his numbers didn't add up. Now it can be made much simpler: Every time he's held up as an example of seriousness, remember that when it mattered, he backed \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 While almost all Republican officeholders have endorsed Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , the same isn't true of what we might call the G.O.P. intelligentsia -- actual or at least self-proclaimed policy experts, opinion writers, and so on. For the most part, the members of this group haven't spoken up in support of this year's Republican nominee. For example, not a single former member of the Council of Economic Advisers has endorsed Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 . If you look at who has endorsed Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  -- say, at the signatories of the statement of support from ''Scholars and Writers for America'' -- it's actually a fairly pathetic group.\par \par \uc2 But if you think that electing Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  would be a disaster, shouldn't you be urging your fellow Americans to vote for his opponent, even if you don't like her? After all, not voting for Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  -- whether you don't vote at all, or make a purely symbolic vote for a third-party candidate -- is, in effect, giving half a vote to Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 To be fair, quite a few conservative intellectuals have accepted that logic, especially among foreign-policy types; you have to give people like, say, Paul Wolfowitz some credit for political courage. But there have also been many who balked at doing the right thing; when Henry Kissinger and George Schultz piously declared that they were not going to endorse anyone, it was a profile in cowardice.\par \par \uc2 And the response from sane Republican economists has been especially disappointing. Only charlatans and cranks have endorsed Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , but only a handful have risen to the occasion and been willing to say that if keeping him out of the White House is important, you need to vote for Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Finally, it's dismaying to see the fecklessness of those on the left supporting third-party candidates. A few seem to believe in the old doctrine of social fascism -- better to see the center-left defeated by the hard right, because that sets the stage for a true progressive revolution. That worked out wonderfully in 1930s Germany.\par \par \uc2 But for most it seems to be about politics as personal expression: they dislike Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  -- partly because they've bought into a misleading media image -- and plan to express that dislike by staying at home or voting for someone like Gary Johnson, the Libertarian candidate. If polls are to be believed, something like a third of young voters intend to, in effect, opt out of this \uc2 election\uc2 . If they do, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  might yet win.\par \par \uc2 In fact, the biggest danger from Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's terrible week is that it might encourage complacency and self-indulgence among voters who really, really wouldn't want to see him in the White House. So remember: Your vote only counts if you cast it in a meaningful way.\par \par \uc2 Read my blog, The Conscience of a Liberal, and follow me on Twitter, @PaulKrugman.\par \par \uc2 Follow The \uc2 New York Times\uc2  Opinion section on \uc2 Facebook\uc2  and Twitter (@NYTopinion), and sign up for the Opinion Today newsletter.\par \par \uc2 Document NYTF000020161003eca300054\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 National Desk; SECTA\par \b \uc2 Florida's Latino Population Veers From G.O.P.\b0\par\par\uc2 By JULIA PRESTON and LIZETTE ALVAREZ \par \uc2 2,311 \uc2 words\par \uc2 3 October 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 11\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 MIAMI -- For decades, being Latino in Florida almost always meant being Republican. Miami was the undisputed capital of Cuban exiles who had fled the Communist government -- they were most of the state's Latinos -- and by the 1980s a large majority had registered with the Republican Party.\par \par \uc2 But a glimpse at the state voter rolls these days, where the names Samuel Del Valle, Maria Flores and Oswaldo Mu\u241\'00\'F1oz all appear as Democrats or independents, makes clear how much has changed in one of the nation's most important swing states, one that will be important for \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  and \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2  in November.\par \par \uc2 In March, Mr. Del Valle, newly arrived from Puerto Rico, stood in front of a voter registration table, staring at the four relatively unfamiliar choices in front of him: Florida Democratic Party, Republican Party of Florida, No Party Affiliation, Minor Party.\par \par \uc2 Back home, major political parties go by different names and their differences hinge on the island's status as an American commonwealth: Should Puerto Rico seek statehood, remain a commonwealth or opt for independence from the United States? But here, he had a new choice to make.\par \par \uc2 ''I chose Democrat,'' said Mr. Del Valle, 34, who lives in St. Cloud, in the Orlando area, and who represents one big reason Florida's Latinos are no longer a predictably Republican vote: the fast-growing Puerto Rican population.\par \par \uc2 When Ms. Flores, the American-born daughter of Cuban refugees, arrived at her new junior high school in Miami from New Orleans three decades ago, the city's Cuban\u237\'00\'EDa -- its Cuban sensibility -- jolted her.\par \par \uc2 But she adapted quickly. Spanglish soon became her third language. She mastered the Cuban greeting -- an air kiss doled out as abundantly as, well, air, even if you just met the person. Then, at 18, she participated in another Miami Cuban rite of passage: She registered to vote as a Republican.\par \par \uc2 ''My parents were Republican, and they were happy with it,'' Ms. Flores said in her living room, the smell of rice and beans floating in from the kitchen.\par \par \uc2 But in 2008, Ms. Flores, 43, a legal secretary and single mother, did what was once unthinkable. She re-registered as a Democrat, another sign Republican candidates can no longer count on Florida's Latinos.\par \par \uc2 From his offices in Doral, a suburb of Miami, Mr. Mu\u241\'00\'F1oz, an entrepreneur from Venezuela, commands an empire of newspapers and websites that stretches across Florida to Panama and Spain. Mr. Mu\u241\'00\'F1oz, 64, is one of the Latin American immigrants who have contributed to the diversity and growth of Doral, which is now 80 percent Latino. Many, like Mr. Mu\u241\'00\'F1oz, arrived with means, while others started with nothing, drawn by the pull of American opportunity.\par \par \uc2 When he came here two decades ago, Doral was a warren of cargo warehouses. But as Venezuelans fled the economic depredations of a socialist president, \uc2 Hugo Ch\u225\'00\'E1vez\uc2 , and his successor, Nicol\u225\'00\'E1s Maduro, Mr. Mu\u241\'00\'F1oz gained readers for his publications, which are known as El Venezolano. A restaurant serving arepas, Venezuela's signature corn pancakes, became a social center of Doral.\par \par \uc2 Cubans, Colombians and Dominicans also moved in, building walled, palm-lined golf course communities. More than 200 companies based their headquarters in Doral. And Mr. Mu\u241\'00\'F1oz sold lots of ads.\par \par \uc2 In his columns, Mr. Mu\u241\'00\'F1oz rails against the leftist government that has reduced Venezuelans to hunger. But in regard to American politics, Mr. Mu\u241\'00\'F1oz, a naturalized citizen, is a registered independent who votes Democratic -- yet another reason the vote in Florida may be so competitive.\par \par \uc2 Ten years ago, Republicans had a registration edge among the state's Latinos -- 37 percent were Republicans, 33 percent were Democrats and 28 percent independents, according to official figures. This year, the party lags among Latinos, with 26 percent registered as Republicans, 37 percent as Democrats and 35 percent as independents. And the independents increasingly lean Democratic, particularly among new immigrants and Puerto Ricans.\par \par \uc2 ''The Hispanic vote in Florida was reliably conservative and now is becoming reliably Democrat,'' said Fernand R. Amandi, a pollster who has extensively surveyed Latinos in this crucial swing state whose 29 electoral votes are very much up for grabs, and could determine the outcome of the presidential race.\par \par \uc2 Still, much remains up in the air. Strong Latino candidates who are Republicans, like Senator \uc2 Marco Rubio\uc2 , still command loyal votes. And in Miami, Representative Carlos Curbelo, a Cuban-American Republican, and Joe Garcia, a Cuban-American Democrat, are in close duel in which Mr. Garcia is trying to retake the congressional seat Mr. Curbelo won from him two years ago.\par \par \uc2 There are few places in America where Latino voting power is as fluid as in Florida. Here are three snapshots.\par \par \uc2 Lured by Change\par \par \uc2 MIAMI -- Ms. Flores was never enamored of politics. But the more she heard her bosses, a group of lawyers, talk, the more she realized she had a kinship with Democrats on issues that affected her. As with so many people who switch parties, her decision was also driven by the top of the ticket, \uc2 Barack Obama\uc2 , in 2008.\par \par \uc2 ''I was a single mom with two kids, and he represented change, and helping people like me, and equality,'' she said.\par \par \uc2 She worried about getting laid off. She worried about how she could afford to get her son a car and pay for college. Yet, she said, the Republican Party didn't speak to her. Instead, it fumed about abortion and religious rights and immigration. ''It was 'God says this and God says that,''' she said.\par \par \uc2 Her father and son, in different ways, are moving in similar directions.\par \par \uc2 Her father, Rolando Bocos, a former yacht builder who once served five years in a Cuban prison after the government charged his brother with carrying a weapon, is no Democrat. ''I think they are Communists,'' Mr. Bocos said. But now, he will not vote for Republicans, either. ''It doesn't matter Republican, Democrat, to me anymore,'' said Mr. Bocos, 77. At his age, he said, ''I'm only interested in Medicare and Social Security.'' He said he would not vote this year.\par \par \uc2 Ms. Flores's 21-year-old son, Alex, a student at \uc2 Florida International University\uc2 , drifted toward the Democrats because of social issues -- gay rights (his godfather and some of his cousins are gay), religious tolerance, female empowerment. ''I knew which side fit my moral compass,'' he said. Last year, he became president of the university's College Democrats.\par \par \uc2 Ms. Flores laughed at the unexpected turn in her life. ''It's funny that I came to Miami and became a Democrat.''\par \par \uc2 The Exile Experience\par \par \uc2 DORAL, Fla. -- The transformation of Doral reflects the broader changes across South Florida. Cuban-Americans no longer dominate, but are now part of a Hispanic mix that includes a wave of immigrants from Latin America. Although many Venezuelans, Colombians and Brazilians have escaped leftist politics at home, once they become Americans they typically become Democrats.\par \par \uc2 Their voting power is limited, but growing. Many immigrants in Doral have not been here long enough to become naturalized, so there are only about 20,000 registered voters among 56,000 residents. But the trend away from Republican dominance is clear: 29 percent are Democrats and 46 percent are registered as independents. Only 24 percent are Republicans.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Mu\u241\'00\'F1oz said Cubans have welcomed Venezuelans to Miami, seeing in them a similar exile experience. The feeling is mutual. ''We live close to their pain, so we understand it,'' he said.\par \par \uc2 But there are differences. Venezuelans reject anything that reminds them of Mr. Ch\u225\'00\'E1vez's authoritarian rule, but they still favor the expansive government role in health care and education that Democrats support. Many Venezuelans are suspicious of the back-room politics they see in the entrenched Miami Republican establishment.\par \par \uc2 Unlike Cuban exiles, who benefit from special entry to the United States, Venezuelans -- and other Latin immigrants -- have no easy path. Some Doral residents are undocumented.\par \par \uc2 ''We are immigrants, and we will always be immigrants,'' Mr. Mu\u241\'00\'F1oz said.\par \par \uc2 This year's race for mayor of Doral reflects the changes. The incumbent, Luigi Boria, is a self-made businessman from Venezuela. A registered independent, he is a Republican in practice and a conservative Christian pastor whose priority has been to promote and bring order to the city's frenetic growth.\par \par \uc2 He is facing a challenge from Sandra Ruiz, a Democrat and popular Mexican-American councilwoman who moved here years ago from San Diego. She zips around town in a car decorated with her photograph. Ms. Ruiz says Mr. Boria is too partial to developers and has failed to include lower-income residents in city programs.\par \par \uc2 Even though Mr. Boria is a compatriot, Mr. Mu\u241\'00\'F1oz and his newspapers are supporting Ms. Ruiz. Warily recalling Mr. Chavez's multiterm rule in Venezuela, he thinks one term for Mr. Boria is enough.\par \par \uc2 But in Doral -- as among Florida Latinos overall -- the person pushing Latinos toward the Democrats this year is the Republican nominee, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 . The owner of a golf course here, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  persuaded Doral to host the Miss Universe beauty pageant in January 2015. The taxpayers ended up paying $1.1 million to Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's organization, Mr. Boria confirmed. But the exposure was a boon to local businesses, and Mr. Boria proposed giving Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  a key to the city.\par \par \uc2 But when Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  began his campaign last year attacking Mexican immigrants as criminals, it cast a shadow on Doral. Ms. Ruiz was offended.\par \par \uc2 ''I felt Doral lost the city's entire investment the moment he opened his mouth regarding Hispanics,'' Ms. Ruiz said.\par \par \uc2 The feeling of insult was heightened after Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  waged a relentless \uc2 Twitter\uc2  assault on Alicia Machado, a former Miss Universe who is Venezuelan, whose story was highlighted by Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  last week's presidential debate. Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  called her ''disgusting'' because she had gained weight after her pageant victory.\par \par \uc2 In an interview in Mr. Mu\u241\'00\'F1oz's publications, Ms. Machado, who became an American citizen this year, exhorted Latino voters to learn from her experience: ''We can't risk having such a violent, bad-tempered, macho person as \uc2 Trump\uc2  as our president.''\par \par \uc2 Mr. Mu\u241\'00\'F1oz explained that Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , although a Republican, reminds him and many other Venezuelans of their leftist nemesis, Mr. Ch\u225\'00\'E1vez. ''It's his arrogance, his intolerance, the way he insults people who disagree with him,'' Mr. Mu\u241\'00\'F1oz said.\par \par \uc2 Speaking His Language\par \par \uc2 ST. CLOUD, Fla. -- When Samuel Del Valle became a Democrat, he joined a huge influx of American citizens streaming into Central Florida -- Puerto Ricans, who are helping reshape the party's political identity. Their growing presence along the state's Interstate 4 corridor is a chief reason Florida's Latino vote has veered away from Republicans.\par \par \uc2 For Mr. Del Valle, a teacher and college graduate, the choice this \uc2 election\uc2  season is easy. He liked the Clintons. He also liked President Obama. He even liked Jeb Bush, but Mr. Bush dropped out of the race. Ultimately, though, he knew enough about the Democratic Party to know it spoke his language, he said.\par \par \uc2 ''They are super on minorities, and women and gays,'' said Mr. Del Valle as his wife, Ver\u243\'00\'F3nica Rivera, unloaded boxes inside the small apartment they rented recently in St. Cloud. ''They support the Arabs, the Indians, the Latinos -- all of us are different and have different cultures.''\par \par \uc2 For the Republican Party, though, the thousands of Puerto Ricans who have fled the island's economic collapse remain within reach. Like many Latinos, they tend to hold conservative values; new to the mainland and without strong partisan preconceptions, they are open to Republican ideas in ways that Puerto Ricans in the North are not. With the right candidate, Puerto Ricans here are open to Republican courtship.\par \par \uc2 Despite the Latino firestorm over Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  and his talk of border walls, Mr. Del Valle says he finds traces of redemption in him.\par \par \uc2 ''I like some Republican ideas,'' he said. The party, he added, stands for patriotism, law and order, discipline in government and a strong military. These ideas are appealing to many Puerto Ricans who have confronted high murder rates and deep-rooted government corruption, but who also boast high levels of military service.\par \par \uc2 ''\uc2 Trump\uc2  does mention things that are true,'' Mr. Del Valle said. ''It's a big border and people are coming illegally.''\par \par \uc2 So far, though, that is not enough to sway Puerto Rican voters. Their growing alliance with Democrats is strongly rooted in the candidates' words and attitudes, and the signals they send about whether Latinos are welcome here as equals.\par \par \uc2 ''I see myself as a Latino who wants to contribute to the United States,'' Mr. Del Valle said. ''And the Democrats are saying things that I want to hear about Latinos.''\par \par \uc2 El Arepazo, a restaurant in Doral, Fla., that serves arepas and other Venezuelan dishes, is a social hub and part of the evolving landscape in the state.

\par\par \uc2 National Desk; SECTA\par \b \uc2 Her Husband Accused of Affairs, a Defiant \uc2 Clinton\uc2  Fought Back\b0\par\par\uc2 By MEGAN TWOHEY; Kitty Bennett contributed research. \par \uc2 2,978 \uc2 words\par \uc2 3 October 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 1\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  was campaigning for her husband in January 1992 when she learned of the race's newest flare-up: Gennifer Flowers had just released tapes of phone calls with \uc2 Bill \uc2 Clinton\uc2  to back up her claim they had had an affair.\par \par \uc2 Other candidates had been driven out of races by accusations of infidelity. But now, at a cold, dark airfield in South Dakota, Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  was questioning campaign aides by phone and vowing to fight back on behalf of her husband.\par \par \uc2 ''Who's tracking down all the research on Gennifer?'' she asked, according to a journalist traveling with her at the time.\par \par \uc2 The enduring image of Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  from that campaign was a ''60 Minutes'' interview in which she told the country she was not blindly supporting her husband out of wifely duty. ''I'm not sitting here, some little woman standing by my man like Tammy Wynette,'' she said.\par \par \uc2 But stand by she did, holding any pain or doubts in check as the campaign battled to keep the Clintons' political aspirations alive.\par \par \uc2 Last week, \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , the Republican presidential nominee, criticized Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  over Mr. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's affairs and her response to them, and said he might talk more about the issue in the final weeks before the \uc2 election\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 That could be a treacherous strategy for Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , given his own past infidelity and questionable treatment of women. Many voters, particularly women, might see Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  being blamed for her husband's conduct.\par \par \uc2 It could also remind voters of a searing period in American history, and in Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's life.\par \par \uc2 Confronting a spouse's unfaithfulness is painful under any circumstance. For Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , it happened repeatedly and in the most public of ways, unfolding at the dawn of the 24/7 news cycle, and later in impeachment proceedings that convulsed the nation.\par \par \uc2 Outwardly, she remained stoic and defiant, defending her husband while a progression of women and well-funded conservative operatives accused Mr. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  of behavior unbecoming the leader of the free world.\par \par \uc2 But privately, she embraced the \uc2 Clinton\uc2  campaign's aggressive strategy of counterattack: Women who claimed to have had sexual encounters with Mr. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  would become targets of digging and discrediting -- tactics that women's rights advocates frequently denounce.\par \par \uc2 The campaign hired a private investigator with a bare-knuckles reputation who embarked on a mission, as he put it in a memo, to impugn Ms. Flowers's ''character and veracity until she is destroyed beyond all recognition.''\par \par \uc2 In a pattern that would later be repeated with other women, the investigator's staff scoured Arkansas and beyond, collecting disparaging accounts from ex-boyfriends, employers and others who claimed to know Ms. Flowers, accounts that the campaign then disseminated to the news media.\par \par \uc2 By the time Mr. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  finally admitted to ''sexual relations'' with Ms. Flowers, years later, \uc2 Clinton\uc2  aides had used stories collected by the private investigator to brand her as a ''bimbo'' and a ''pathological liar.''\par \par \uc2 Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's level of involvement in that effort, as described in interviews, internal campaign records and archives, is still the subject of debate. By some accounts, she gave the green light and was a motivating force; by others, her support was no more than tacit assent.\par \par \uc2 What is clear is that Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  was in a difficult spot. She was aware that her husband had cheated earlier in their marriage, but by her telling, she also believed him when he denied the accusations levied by Ms. Flowers and others.\par \par \uc2 Mickey Kantor, the chairman of \uc2 Bill \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's 1992 campaign, said that Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  wanted to separate fact from fiction and to size up the women making the claims.\par \par \uc2 ''Let's say the woman has some not-helpful things that she has done in the past,'' Mr. Kantor said. ''Wouldn't you want to know that, and evaluate it?''\par \par \uc2 At the same time, a growing cadre of conservative groups and media outlets had begun focusing on the issue. Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , those close to her said, viewed the attacks as a political crusade that demanded a stiff political response.\par \par \uc2 And that determination to fight back inspired others in the campaign to do the same.\par \par \uc2 ''She's the firefighter running to the fire,'' Mr. Kantor said, ''not away from it.''\par \par \uc2 Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  and her husband declined to be interviewed, and her campaign did not answer questions about her support of efforts to undermine the women. ''The country closed the book on these matters close to 20 years ago, and there is nothing whatsoever new here,'' her spokesman, Brian Fallon, said in a statement.\par \par \uc2 Her campaign also released statements from James Carville, Mr. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's top campaign strategist, and two lawyers who worked for Mr. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , saying that Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  had not overseen the counterattacks.\par \par \uc2 ''Those who took the lead in responding to those attacks at the time have plainly stated that \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  did not direct their work,'' Mr. Fallon said.\par \par \uc2 Neutralizing the Whispers\par \par \uc2 Four years after Gary Hart fled a presidential race amid speculation about an affair, every accusation of womanizing was viewed as a mortal threat to Mr. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's campaign.\par \par \uc2 Stanley Greenberg, a pollster for the campaign who had strategized with the Clintons in the fall of 1991 about how to handle the rumors of infidelity, recalled Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's acknowledgment that her husband had strayed.\par \par \uc2 ''It was an uncomfortable meeting,'' Mr. Greenberg said in an interview for an oral history of Mr. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's presidency conducted by the Miller Center at the \uc2 University of Virginia\uc2 . ''I remember Hillary saying that, 'obviously, if I could say no to this question, we would say no, and therefore, there is an issue.'''\par \par \uc2 Weeks later, their first taste of trouble came in a Penthouse magazine story by a rock groupie named Connie Hamzy, who claimed Mr. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  had once propositioned her at a hotel in Little Rock, Ark.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  brushed off the story, saying that Ms. Hamzy had made a sexual advance toward him, George Stephanopoulos, the communications director of the 1992 campaign, recalled in his book, ''All Too Human.''\par \par \uc2 But Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  demanded action.\par \par \uc2 ''We have to destroy her story,'' she said, according to Mr. Stephanopoulos.\par \par \uc2 In what became a common tactic, affidavits were collected, from an aide and two others who stated that they were with Mr. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  at the hotel and that Ms. Hamzy's story was false. (Contacted recently, Ms. Hamzy said she stood by her account.)\par \par \uc2 When the work was done, both Clintons called Mr. Stephanopoulos, together, to offer their thanks.\par \par \uc2 An Explosive Accusation\par \par \uc2 The Gennifer Flowers story landed like a bomb weeks before the New Hampshire primary.\par \par \uc2 Ms. Flowers, a lounge singer and Arkansas state employee at the time, sold Star magazine her story claiming an affair with Mr. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  that had lasted more than 10 years.\par \par \uc2 In a meeting with aides, the Clintons scripted a unified defense that they delivered in the interview on ''60 Minutes.''\par \par \uc2 With Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  nodding agreement, Mr. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  admitted to the TV audience to ''causing pain in my marriage,'' but denied an affair with Ms. Flowers. Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  professed sympathy for Ms. Flowers, saying she had been caught up in rumors through no fault of her own.\par \par \uc2 But at a news conference the next day, Ms. Flowers reasserted her claims, playing excerpts from her calls with Mr. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 . The two could be heard discussing the attention the rumors were getting, and she joked about his sexual talents.\par \par \uc2 Glimpsing the news conference in South Dakota, Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  directed an aide to get Mr. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  on the phone, Gail Sheehy, a journalist traveling with her, recalled in a recent interview.\par \par \uc2 ''It was a reaction of no surprise, but immediate anger and action,'' said Ms. Sheehy, who also described her observations in a Vanity Fair article that year. ''Not anger at Bill, but at Flowers, the press and Republicans.''\par \par \uc2 Back on a plane that night, Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  told Ms. Sheehy that if she were to question Ms. Flowers in front of a jury, ''I would crucify her.''\par \par \uc2 [Video: 01/26/92: The Clintons Watch on \uc2 YouTube\uc2 .]\par \par \uc2 Explaining His Behavior\par \par \uc2 Years later, Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  would say she had thought her husband had conquered his weakness in the late 1980s. The comment came in an interview with Talk magazine in 1999, after the Monica Lewinsky scandal nearly brought down his presidency.\par \par \uc2 In that interview, as well as in conversations around that time with a friend, Diane Blair, she explained her husband's straying: It was rooted in his childhood, when he felt pressure to please two women -- a mother and a grandmother -- who battled over him; he was under great stress; she herself had not attended to his emotional needs.\par \par \uc2 ''She thinks she was not smart enough, not sensitive enough, not free enough of her own concerns and struggles to realize the price he was paying,'' Ms. Blair wrote in her notes of their talks.\par \par \uc2 And, in Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's eyes, her husband's encounters with Ms. Lewinsky were ''not sex within any real meaning,'' she told Ms. Blair.\par \par \uc2 But in 1992, that unbending devotion to Mr. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  had an important effect. It had made a lasting impression on everyone around the couple, and helped keep the campaign from listing.\par \par \uc2 She did not falter, even when her aide, Richard Mintz, told her she would have to call Ms. Wynette, who had taken offense to the ''60 Minutes'' reference.\par \par \uc2 ''Was this what she wanted to do? No,'' Mr. Mintz said in an interview. ''But she gathered herself together. She was composed and resilient.''\par \par \uc2 ''It was the toughest week you could ever imagine.''\par \par \uc2 The Digging Begins\par \par \uc2 Weeks later, a small group of campaign aides, along with Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , met at the governor's mansion in Little Rock, and they made a pivotal decision: They would hire Jack Palladino, a private investigator known for tactics such as making surreptitious recordings and deploying attractive women to extract information.\par \par \uc2 An aide to the campaign, who declined to be publicly identified because the aide had not been authorized to speak for the Clintons, said Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  was among those who had discussed and approved the hiring, which shifted the campaign to a more aggressive posture.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Kantor, the campaign chairman, said he did not know whether Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  had specifically approved Mr. Palladino's employment as the other aide recalled. But he said that she had seen a need for outside help.\par \par \uc2 ''She believed we had to deal with the issue directly,'' Mr. Kantor said.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Palladino, who did not respond to requests for an interview, reported to James Lyons, a lawyer working for the campaign. In a memo that he addressed to Mr. Lyons on March 30, Mr. Palladino proposed a full-court press on Ms. Flowers.\par \par \uc2 ''Every acquaintance, employer, and past lover should be located and interviewed,'' Mr. Palladino wrote. ''She is now a shining icon -- telling lies that so far have proved all benefit and no cost -- for any other opportunist who may be considering making \uc2 Clinton\uc2  a target.''\par \par \uc2 Soon, Ms. Flowers heard from ex-boyfriends and others who said they had been contacted by a private investigator.\par \par \uc2 ''They would say that he would try to manipulate them,'' Ms. Flowers recalled, ''or get them to say things like I was sexually active.''\par \par \uc2 Karen Steele, who had worked with Ms. Flowers at the Roy Clark Celebrity Theater in Branson, Mo., was among those who received a visit. ''I remember I got questioned about brothers Gennifer and I once dated,'' she said. ''It wasn't warm and fuzzy.''\par \par \uc2 Going on Offense\par \par \uc2 The information gathered by Mr. Palladino was given to Betsey Wright, a former chief of staff to Mr. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  in Arkansas who, with Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's support, was put in charge of dealing with accusations of infidelity.\par \par \uc2 ''Betsey Wright was handling whatever those issues were,'' \uc2 Susan Thomases\uc2 , a friend of the Clintons who had served in the campaign, told the oral history project. ''And it had been very comfortable because Hillary had let her do it.''\par \par \uc2 Through Ms. Wright, the digging into Ms. Flowers and other women would be passed on to reporters.\par \par \uc2 Ms. Wright declined to be interviewed, saying in an email, ''It is reprehensible that The \uc2 New York Times\uc2  is joining The National Enquirer and \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  by dredging up irrelevant slime from the past.''\par \par \uc2 At the time, Ms. Wright boasted to The \uc2 Washington Post\uc2  of Mr. Palladino's success in countering what she memorably called ''bimbo eruptions,'' and in defusing two dozen accusations of affairs, which she contended were false.\par \par \uc2 In the cover story of an issue of Penthouse in which Ms. Flowers posed nude -- she would earn at least $500,000 selling her story to media outlets -- Ms. Wright pushed allegations about her gathered by Mr. Palladino, including ''r\u233\'00\'E9sum\u233\'00\'E9 hype, attempted blackmail, manufacturing a self-styled 12-year affair with \uc2 Clinton\uc2  to salvage a flopola singing career.''\par \par \uc2 Ms. Wright read to the Penthouse reporter a statement, taken by Mr. Palladino, that ''when the richest of her many lovers would not leave his wife, or come across with more money, she staged a suicide attempt with wine and Valium.''\par \par \uc2 Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  herself took aim at Ms. Flowers in a June 1992 appearance on ''The Arsenio Hall Show'' better remembered for Mr. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's saxophone playing. Mr. Hall asked Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  about Ms. Flowers: ''You know what her problem is?''\par \par \uc2 ''She's got lots of problems,'' Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  said.\par \par \uc2 Ms. Flowers denied the accusations about her, calling the suicide story, in particular, ''false and cruel.''\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  later admitted, during a deposition in the Paula Jones sexual harassment case, that he had sex with Ms. Flowers once.\par \par \uc2 ''You've got to believe that \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  wanted to protect her husband and thought he was being unfairly charged,'' Mr. Kantor said. ''Does she know more today than she did then? Of course.''\par \par \uc2 Gloria Allred, a well-known women's rights lawyer who was a convention delegate for Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , said that digging up a woman's sexual past was a classic shaming strategy.\par \par \uc2 ''Most people are not nuns, and most people aren't Girl Scouts,'' Ms. Allred said. ''That doesn't mean they're not telling the truth.''\par \par \uc2 Told of Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's support for hiring Mr. Palladino, she said, ''If Hillary signed off on a private investigator, let's call it a minus.'' But she added, ''It wouldn't change my support for her because there are so many pluses for her, like her stance on abortion.''\par \par \uc2 ''I'd like to hear from \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  on the role she played.''\par \par \uc2 Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's campaign, asked about her role, released a statement from Mr. Lyons saying that Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  ''was not involved in hiring'' the private investigator. It also released a statement from Mr. Carville.\par \par \uc2 ''Hillary wanted us to defend the governor against attacks,'' Mr. Carville's statement said, adding: ''It's just ridiculous to imagine that she was somehow directing our response operation. That was my job, not hers.''\par \par \uc2 A Lawsuit's Heavy Toll\par \par \uc2 After Ms. Jones, an Arkansas state employee, accused Mr. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  in 1994 of having made an unwanted sexual advance, Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  begged Ms. Wright to ''put a stop to it,'' Ms. Wright recalled in Carl Bernstein's book ''A Woman in Charge.''\par \par \uc2 In a recent interview, Ms. Jones put it this way: ''They sent out people to dig up trash on me.''\par \par \uc2 The Clintons saw Ms. Jones's lawsuit in political terms; it was eventually bankrolled by the conservative Rutherford Institute, part of what Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  would call a ''vast right-wing conspiracy'' out to get the couple.\par \par \uc2 But it would take a great toll.\par \par \uc2 Before Mr. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  settled for $850,000, without making any admissions, Ms. Jones's lawyers were able to ask him in a deposition about Ms. Lewinsky. His lying about their affair ultimately led to his impeachment on charges of perjury and obstruction of justice.\par \par \uc2 In her book ''Living History,'' Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  wrote that after Mr. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  admitted what had happened, she was left ''feeling dumbfounded, heartbroken and outraged that I'd believed him.''\par \par \uc2 Friends wondered whether the marriage had reached its breaking point.\par \par \uc2 But weeks later, Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  told her friend Ms. Blair that ''they're connected in every way imaginable, she feels strongly about him and family and Chelsea and marriage, and she's just got to try to work it through,'' according to Ms. Blair's personal writings, which her family gave to the \uc2 University of Arkansas\uc2  after her death in 2000.\par \par \uc2 While Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  considered the Lewinsky affair a ''personal lapse'' by her husband, she gave him credit for trying to break it off and manage someone who was a ''narcissistic loony toon,'' according to Ms. Blair's papers.\par \par \uc2 Soon after, Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  expressed pleasure to her friend that she and her husband were able to drive ''their adversaries totally nuts'' because they did not appear to be suffering.\par \par \uc2 Ms. Blair wrote in that entry a direct quotation from Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 : ''Most people in this town have no pain threshold.''\par \par \uc2 Find out what you need to know about the 2016 presidential race today, and get politics news updates via \uc2 Facebook\uc2 , \uc2 Twitter\uc2  and the First Draft newsletter.\par \par \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  campaigned on Sunday in Charlotte, N.C.

\par\par \b \uc2 Election\uc2  2016: Debate Roles Shift to the Understudies --- Kaine's popularity in Virginia has allowed \uc2 Clinton\uc2  to focus on other swing states\b0\par\par\uc2 By Michael C. Bender   \par \uc2 652 \uc2 words\par \uc2 3 October 2016\par \uc2 The Wall Street Journal\par \uc2 J\par A6\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 Democratic presidential candidate \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  introduced her running mate, Sen. Tim Kaine, as a future partner in the White House and hinted at an outsize role he may play in her potential administration.\par \par \uc2 The former Virginia governor already is playing such a part in the campaign by energizing activists in his home state and helping the \uc2 Clinton\uc2  campaign save time and money in what once was a Republican stronghold.\par \par \uc2 While Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's recent lead has tightened in other battleground states, she maintains an advantage in this swing state of about 9 percentage points, double the margin before she named Mr. Kaine to her ticket, according to a Real Clear Politics average of polls.\par \par \uc2 "There was a lot of excitement leading up to his selection, and the response has been overwhelming," said Democratic state Sen. Jeremy McPike.\par \par \uc2 Mr. McPike said supporters are planning a pilgrimageon Tuesdayto Farmville, Va., where Mr. Kaine and his Republican counterpart, Indiana Gov. Mike Pence, will briefly eclipse the tops of their respective tickets during the only scheduled debate between the vice-presidential nominees.\par \par \uc2 Vice-presidential candidates usually add little significant political value to their running mate's campaign. But it is unusual for a presidential candidate to select her No. 2 from such a consequential battleground as Virginia, said \uc2 Kyle Kopko\uc2 , co-author of "The VP Advantage: How Running Mates Influence Home State Voting in Presidential Elections."\par \par \uc2 "There's never been anything this clear," Mr. Kopko said about the importance of the Kaine nomination on the electoral map.\par \par \uc2 Even before his addition to the ticket, an influx of new voters had helped loosen Republicans' hold on the \uc2 Old Dominion\uc2 . The arrival of Latino, Asian-American and college-educated voters to the state's northern suburbs near Washington, D.C., helped deliver the state to \uc2 Barack Obama\uc2  in 2008 -- the first Democratic presidential nominee to win there since Lyndon Johnson in 1964 -- and again in 2012.\par \par \uc2 Still, Republican presidential nominee \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  is treating Virginia as a priority. Either he or Mr. Pence have traveled to the state about once a week since the Republican National Convention in July. His campaign, along with some help from the \uc2 National Rifle Association\uc2 , aired about $3 million in TV ads in the state last month.\par \par \uc2 "Virginia is a very important state," Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  told supporters during a Sept. 6 campaign stop in Virginia Beach.\par \par \uc2 Corey Stewart, the chairman of Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's campaign in Virginia, said the Republican's team will start advertising in the state soon.\par \par \uc2 Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , meanwhile, hasn't set foot in Virginia since her convention.\par \par \uc2 Her campaign suspended her TV-advertising campaign in Virginia in August. Instead, Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  has leaned on visits by her surrogates.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Kaine, a fluent Spanish speaker, has been dispatched mostly to Florida. But he has also campaigned around Virginia, making stops in Richmond, where he was mayor; in the Richmond suburb of Henrico County; and in Norfolk. He was in Alexandria last week when his campaign won the endorsement of Republican John Warner, a former U.S. senator.\par \par \uc2 In Richmond, Mr. Kaine earned a reputation as a moderate for his votes to ban lap dancing and making it tougher to open adult bookstores, in addition to his support of some abortion restrictions.\par \par \uc2 As governor, Mr. Kaine also pursued gun restrictions after the 2007 mass killings at \uc2 Virginia Tech\uc2 , and won a smoking ban in restaurants. He specialized in housing discrimination lawsuits as a civil-rights lawyer, and he was selected mayor by a Richmond City Council that was mostly African-American.\par \par \uc2 (See related article: "Stakes have risen for Pence, \uc2 Trump\uc2 's 'bridge' to the rest of the GOP, after last week's event" -- WSJ October 3, 2016)\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=wjco20161003000081"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document J000000020161003eca300020\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw272\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4080\pichgoal600

\par\par \b \uc2 Election\uc2  2016: \uc2 Clinton\uc2  Calls for Justice Reform\b0\par\par\uc2 By Colleen McCain Nelson   \par \uc2 374 \uc2 words\par \uc2 3 October 2016\par \uc2 The Wall Street Journal\par \uc2 J\par A4\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 CHARLOTTE, N.C. -- \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  called for "end-to-end reform" of the criminal-justice system on Sunday, telling this community that has been roiled by racial unrest that simply imposing more law and order won't solve the country's problems.\par \par \uc2 The Democratic nominee sought to offer comfort to a city that is struggling with the aftermath of the shooting death of Keith Lamont Scott by police. While Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  met with African-American community leaders in North Carolina on Sunday, her campaign aides and fellow Democrats defended the former secretary of state's leaked comments about young voters who supported Sen. Bernie Sanders in the primary.\par \par \uc2 The Democratic presidential nominee made no mention of her Republican rival, \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2 , but said those who suggest that law and order are the solution ignore the systemic racism in this country.\par \par \uc2 "There are some out there who see this as a moment to fan the flames of resentment and division, who want to exploit people's fears even though it means tearing our nation even further apart," she said.\par \par \uc2 Also on Sunday, Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's advisers and allies offered an explanation of her remarks about millennial voters. In a hacked audio clip recorded at a private event in February and taken from a campaign staffer's email, Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  spoke about why many young, frustrated voters backed Mr. Sanders, her Democratic rival.\par \par \uc2 "They're children of the Great Recession," Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  said in the recording that was posted online by the Washington Free Beacon. "And they are living in their parents' basement. They feel that they got their education, and the jobs that are available to them are not at all what they envisioned for themselves."\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  tried to capitalize on the comments to woo Sanders backers. "\uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  thinks Bernie Sanders's supporters are hopeless and ignorant basement-dwellers," the GOP nominee said in Pennsylvania on Saturday night.\par \par \uc2 In televised interviews on Sunday, the Vermont senator repeatedly came to Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's defense, saying she correctly characterized the struggles of many of his supporters.\par \par \uc2 Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  didn't address her leaked comments on Sunday.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=wjco20161003000042"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document J000000020161003eca30000x\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw272\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4080\pichgoal600

\par\par \b \uc2 Election\uc2  2016: \uc2 Trump\uc2 's Rough Week Vexes GOP --- Republicans, worried about undecided voters, look to get campaign back on track\b0\par\par\uc2 By Janet Hook   \par \uc2 509 \uc2 words\par \uc2 3 October 2016\par \uc2 The Wall Street Journal\par \uc2 J\par A4\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2 's presidential campaign has been thrown off balance by a string of controversies -- topped by revelations about his taxes this weekend -- that have left Republicans increasingly anxious that he is running out of time to make a closing argument to undecided voters.\par \par \uc2 With just five weeks left before \uc2 Election\uc2  Day and early voting already starting in some states, many Republicans believe Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's setbacks -- some self-inflicted -- in the week since his first debate with Democratic rival \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  have stolen momentum he seemed to be gaining.\par \par \uc2 "The tax revelations seem to cap off what has been a really horrendous week for the campaign," said GOP pollster Neil Newhouse. "There is no question that \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  has a very potent message of change that resonates with voters, but time is running out for him to really get voters to hear that over the other noise he's making in the campaign."\par \par \uc2 At the first debate, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  appeared ill prepared and was on the defensive for many of the exchanges, including Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's accusation that he had denigrated a Miss Universe for gaining weight.\par \par \uc2 That baited Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  into a dayslong squabble over the episode. He went off script at a rally in Pennsylvania Saturday where he raised unsubstantiated questions about Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's loyalty to her husband and mocked her physical appearance when she had pneumonia.\par \par \uc2 Former House Speaker \uc2 Newt Gingrich\uc2 , a \uc2 Trump\uc2  supporter, had two pieces of advice for Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  to get his campaign on track: Give up sending his own unedited \uc2 Twitter\uc2  messages, and prepare more seriously for the second debate, next Sunday.\par \par \uc2 "The president of the United States can't tweet at 3 a.m. randomly; it's a precondition of him being deemed prepared to be president," Mr. Gingrich said in an interview.\par \par \uc2 Trump\uc2  spokesman Jason Miller said he believed the race remained deadlocked in most polls, and said of Mr. Gingrich's suggestions: "You're always going to have a number of different recommendations from friends and allies."\par \par \uc2 He added, "Over the final five-plus weeks of this race, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  knows exactly what needs to be done to secure victory: Communicate his vision on reigniting our economy and keeping America safe."\par \par \uc2 Democrats used the tax report as ammunition to intensify their demands that he release his tax returns.\par \par \uc2 Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid (D., Nev.), in a statement Sunday, called Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  "a billion-dollar loser who won't release his taxes because they'll expose him as a spoiled, rich brat who lost the millions he inherited from his father."\par \par \uc2 Trump\uc2  surrogates on Sunday responded to the report about his tax returns. New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, a Republican and close adviser to Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , said the tax documents show Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  is a smart businessman -- and what an "absolute mess" the tax code is.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=wjco20161003000039"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document J000000020161003eca30000u\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw272\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4080\pichgoal600

\par\par \b \uc2 Notable & Quotable: Stocks Don't Sweat \uc2 Trump\b0\par\par\uc2 351 \uc2 words\par \uc2 3 October 2016\par \uc2 The Wall Street Journal\par \uc2 J\par A17\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 From "Economics of U.S. Policy Uncertainty," an August report by Ryan Sweet, Adam Ozimek and Kathryn Asher of Moody's Analytics:\par \par \uc2 Econometric analysis confirms the lack of a relationship between the S&P 500 and \uc2 Trump\uc2 's electoral odds. Regression analysis shows that day-to-day changes in \uc2 Trump\uc2 's odds of winning had a statistically insignificant effect on log differences of the S&P 500. This is true even when controlling for log differences in Canadian and British stock markets, which should isolate U.S.-specific changes in expectations about the future of corporate profitability.\par \par \uc2 There are several possible reasons for the lack of a relationship. First is that investors, and businesses more widely, are discounting the odds of a \uc2 Trump election\uc2 . However, forecasts based on polling data show odds of a similar magnitude. In addition, past research -- at least prior to the Brexit referendum -- showed that betting markets have performed well as predictors of electoral outcomes.\par \par \uc2 Another possibility is that businesses are discounting the negative effects that \uc2 Trump\uc2  would have on earnings and profitability. Though the stock market can affect the economy, the two do not move in tandem. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's policies could be bad for job and GDP growth but still be healthy for corporate bottom lines. In addition, businesses may expect \uc2 Trump\uc2 's actions to be significantly constrained by the legislative and judicial branches, minimizing his impact on the actual economy.\par \par \uc2 Finally, \uc2 Trump\uc2  may represent a tail risk, which is the risk of a low-probability event with a large impact. The odds of his \uc2 election\uc2  may be a small-probability outcome, and the dangers he represents to the economy conditional on \uc2 election\uc2  may be small-probability events with large negative effects. For example, a default or even loss of confidence in the national debt would be a potential tail risk: highly unlikely but very damaging. There is some evidence that tail risks can be systematically underestimated, which could explain the lack of stock market reaction so far.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=wjco20161003000020"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document J000000020161003eca30000b\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw272\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4080\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 REVIEW & OUTLOOK (Editorial)\par \b \uc2 Progressives for \uc2 Trump\uc2  Tax Reform\b0\par\par\uc2 834 \uc2 words\par \uc2 3 October 2016\par \uc2 The Wall Street Journal\par \uc2 J\par A16\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 Who would have believed it? \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  has driven his political opponents to embrace the cause of tax reform so the wealthy have fewer loopholes to exploit. That seems to be the inescapable logic of the media and \uc2 Clinton\uc2  campaign's reaction to the weekend story that Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  may have used large income losses to reduce his tax payments.\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 New York Times\uc2  reported Saturday that it had received an anonymous gift in the mail of three pages from three of Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's state tax returns from 1995. The real-estate and casino magnate, who was having well-known business problems at the time, reported a loss of $916 million on those New Jersey, New York and Connecticut returns.\par \par \uc2 The Times concludes from these losses and after consulting those it called "tax experts" that the resulting tax deduction "could have allowed him to legally avoid paying any federal income taxes for up to 18 years." Cue the synthetic shock and outrage.\par \par \uc2 Note that word "legally." No one, not even the \uc2 Clinton\uc2  campaign, is claiming Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  broke any tax laws 20 years ago. Had he done so you can bet the \uc2 IRS\uc2  would have noticed, since the tax agency doesn't routinely ignore tax losses that large.\par \par \uc2 The details from three pages are scant and don't reveal the specific tax deductions that Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  might have exploited in 1995 or other years. But even average taxpayers who declare self-employment income know that business losses are deductible, often across several years. This reflects that the cycle of business investment and sales isn't confined to a calendar tax year.\par \par \uc2 The real-estate business is also notorious for complex accounting and depreciation practices that can reduce tax liability. Developers borrow heavily, and the interest on that debt is deductible. Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  didn't write the tax laws he was exploiting, though President \uc2 Bill \uc2 Clinton\uc2  did have a hand in writing them since he pushed a major tax bill through Congress in 1993 with a Democratic Congress. Maybe \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  should blame her husband and party for tolerating such rules.\par \par \uc2 What is illegal in this story is that someone disclosed Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's tax returns without his permission. The Times reports that the postmark on the documents indicates they were sent from New York City, and the "return address claimed the envelope had been sent from \uc2 Trump\uc2  Tower." The \uc2 Trump\uc2  Tower bit is probably a joke, and the sender could have traveled to New York from anywhere to send them.\par \par \uc2 But the tax-return leak was nonetheless all too predictable. The \uc2 Trump\uc2  campaign is attacking the newspaper for publishing the documents, but publication is not a crime. Releasing it is. The left is committed to defeating Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  by whatever means possible, and many believe this end justifies any means, much as progressives have justified the Edward Snowden leaks despite the damage to national security.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  also invited this October surprise by refusing to release his tax returns. Had he done so last year, when we advised him to, the debate over the details would have burned itself out. The smart play in politics is transparency to give your opponents nowhere to go.\par \par \uc2 The Clintons can count on a protective press corps to ignore or forgive their email and \uc2 Clinton\uc2  Foundation\uc2  deceptions, but Republicans will never get that break. \uc2 Mitt Romney\uc2  made the same mistake by waiting to release his 2011 tax return until September 2012, and George W. Bush almost lost in 2000 when someone disclosed his drunk-driving conviction shortly before \uc2 Election\uc2  Day. Don't Republicans understand that their secrets will always be exposed, and at the most damaging moment?\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  hasn't helped his cause by boasting about how "smart" he is for paying little tax. This is the vainglorious \uc2 Trump\uc2  who can't stand to be criticized. He should be saying instead that the tax code is dumb. He could say he's fortunate to have the means to hire lawyers and accountants who can maneuver through the tax maze to cut his payments. But he knows most Americans aren't so lucky.\par \par \uc2 He could also say that Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's tax plans all but guarantee that the rich would pay less in taxes. She wants to raise rates, which would invite the rich to lobby Congress for more loopholes, which it would eventually pass, which would be fine for the Clintons and \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  but be terrible for middle-class Americans and the economy.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  has made so many campaign mistakes that it's a miracle he's still competitive. He owes this to the fact that a majority of Americans clearly don't want to vote for Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 . But the hour is late, and if he wants to win he has to stop pursuing defensive, egotistical sideshows and focus on his plans to make America better.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=wjco20161003000014"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document J000000020161003eca300005\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 OPINION\par \uc2 Sunday Review Desk; SECTSR\par \b \uc2 Corruption in the Soprano State\b0\par\par\uc2 By MATT KATZ \par \uc2 1,468 \uc2 words\par \uc2 2 October 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 3\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Six years ago New Jersey's new governor, \uc2 Chris Christie\uc2  , walked into a movie theater with a political ally named \uc2 Bill Baroni\uc2  and several actors from ''The Sopranos.'' The film they were there to see was ''The Soprano State,'' a documentary on political corruption in New Jersey, filled with tales of no-show jobs, cash-stuffed envelopes passed across linoleum diner tables and government contracts won with pay-to-play campaign donations.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Christie, who had just been elected governor on the strength of his record of busting dirty politicians of both parties as the state's high-profile United States attorney, was featured in the film. ''When people found out I was from New Jersey they would bring up one of two things -- either political corruption or 'The Sopranos,' '' he said to the camera.\par \par \uc2 He ran for governor vowing to clean up the state. But over the past two weeks, a federal corruption trial in Newark has made it disappointingly clear that the governor failed. As it has turned out, Mr. Christie, who is now running \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2  's transition team to fill top jobs should Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  win the White House, ended up tarnishing his own administration.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Baroni, the governor's theater companion and one of his top appointees to the \uc2 Port Authority of New York and New Jersey\uc2  , sits at the defense table with a former Christie aide, Bridget Anne Kelly. Both are charged with orchestrating, and then covering up, a four-day traffic jam of disaster-movie proportions to punish a local Democratic mayor for not endorsing Governor Christie's 2013 re-\uc2 election\uc2  bid.\par \par \uc2 The trial has put into stark relief the corruption that seems rife in New Jersey politics. If the lawman \uc2 Chris Christie\uc2  couldn't fix it -- if he could, in fact, turn government into a taxpayer-funded organ of his political ambitions -- then who's to save the Garden State?\par \par \uc2 Before joining the \uc2 Port Authority\uc2  , Mr. Baroni served in the State Senate and Assembly, taught ethics at a law school and served as an F.B.I. informant. In that role, he collected dirt on politicians so federal investigators -- who were led by Mr. Christie at the time -- could build the very corruption cases that would help make Mr. Christie governor. After working to get Mr. Christie elected, Mr. Baroni then became the governor's $290,000-a-year man at the \uc2 Port Authority\uc2  , a New York-New Jersey agency with tens of billions of dollars in assets and control over the region's airports, ports and river crossings.\par \par \uc2 In the state's time-honored tradition of patronage, Republican hires soon filled the \uc2 Port Authority\uc2  , including a part-time soap opera actor who co-wrote Mr. Baroni's weight-loss book, ''Fat Kid Got Fit and So Can You!'' For one new \uc2 Port Authority\uc2  appointee, \uc2 David Wildstein\uc2 , a job was created: director of capital projects. This was a sham title because Mr. Wildstein's real job title would not have looked good on a business card: dark-arts political operative.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Wildstein's credentials for the post were his bizarre and sordid political past, like once stealing Senator Frank Lautenberg's suit jacket before a debate so the Democrat would look uncomfortable onstage in a borrowed coat. Mr. Wildstein testified that Governor Christie used to call him Mr. Wolf, for the ''Pulp Fiction'' character played by Harvey Keitel who specialized in cleaning up dead bodies. Soon enough, Mr. Wildstein was spying on \uc2 Port Authority\uc2  employees.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Wildstein told jurors that he served ''one constituent'' -- Governor Christie himself -- and not the millions of motorists a year who pay $15 to get over the world's busiest bridge to New York City. Among his tasks, Mr. Wildstein was to use the leverage of the \uc2 Port Authority\uc2  to win endorsements for the governor's re-\uc2 election\uc2  as Mr. Christie pondered a race for the White House.\par \par \uc2 Mayors whose endorsements were sought were wooed with behind-the-scenes tours of the Port Authority-controlled ground zero, and gifts of flags that flew over the site and commemorative burned steel salvaged from the rubble. To keep these activities furtive, Christie officials directed Mr. Wildstein to use a private email address to evade public records laws.\par \par \uc2 Despite years of Christie courtship (\uc2 New York Giants\uc2  tickets, cocktail parties at the governor's mansion and a shuttle bus for his town), Mayor Mark Sokolich of Fort Lee declined to endorse Mr. Christie. That's when Mr. Wildstein closed lanes from the town of Fort Lee to the George Washington Bridge, causing gridlock on the first four days of school and compromising emergency medical response.\par \par \uc2 He has pleaded guilty and testified for the prosecution, saying in court that he and Mr. Baroni ''bragged'' to the governor about the traffic jams while they were happening. The bragging took place at ground zero, before a solemn Sept. 11 anniversary event. Mr. Wildstein also testified that he told the governor that they were ignoring cries from the mayor, who was upset that the lane closures were endangering residents.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Christie laughed at this news, Mr. Wildstein testified.''I was pleasing my one constituent and I was proud of it,'' he told the court. ''I was happy that he was happy.''\par \par \uc2 After the lanes reopened on Sept. 13, 2013, reporters began asking questions. That's when Mayor Sokolich wrote a letter to a local paper saying he didn't think the lane closures were retaliatory. But he testified that he sent the letter only because he was ''petrified'' -- petrified of his own state government.\par \par \uc2 Shortly after the mayor's letter was published I asked Governor Christie at a news conference if he had had anything to do with the lane closings. ''I worked the cones actually, Matt,'' he replied. ''Unbeknownst to everybody, I was actually the guy out there, I was in overalls and a hat. You really are not serious with that question.''\par \par \uc2 But Mr. Wildstein testified that by this point, in December 2013, in addition to the governor, he had also told several top Christie aides about what he had done. Still, the administration denied that anything was amiss. They kept with Mr. Wildstein's cover story of a traffic study.\par \par \uc2 Through their lawyers, those aides deny this. As does Mr. Christie, who is not charged in the case. If Mr. Wildstein told him something about traffic at the ground zero ceremony, the governor has said, he wouldn't have paid it any mind because there's always traffic at the bridge.\par \par \uc2 Now, as Mr. Christie vets potential appointees for a \uc2 Trump\uc2  administration, a look at how he operated in New Jersey -- and the one-constituency rule -- might be instructive. Already, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  has brought onto his campaign team two former Christie aides who were deeply involved in the endorsement courtships. (This, despite Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's having said during the primary that the governor ''totally knew'' about the bridge scandal.) New Jersey-style politics may soon go national.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Christie's\uc2  time as governor is nearing an end, regardless. He is term-limited out in January 2018. He'll leave behind a deeply wounded \uc2 Port Authority\uc2  , with higher tolls and decaying infrastructure. Mr. Christie and \uc2 Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo\uc2  of New York jointly vetoed bills to reform the agency, so the potential remains for it to continue to be co-opted by the political and personal interests of wealthy insiders like David Samson, the former Port Authority chairman and state attorney general, and a father figure to Mr. Christie.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Samson recently pleaded guilty to bribery while Port Authority chairman, admitting that he pressured \uc2 United Airlines\uc2  to operate a weekly flight to South Carolina so he could get to his vacation home. Mr. Christie's former transportation commissioner has also been charged in the case.\par \par \uc2 Pessimism about the state's direction is the worst since two months before Mr. Christie took office in January 2010, according to the latest Rutgers-Eagleton poll.\par \par \uc2 I would ask the governor about why this is, but after he dropped out of the presidential race, I was told by an intermediary that I'm ''dead'' to him. So for insight let's go back to that day six years ago when Mr. Christie screened ''The Soprano State.'' On the way into the theater, the governor offered a bit of sad truth: ''We'll always have a corruption problem in New Jersey.''\par \par \uc2 Follow The \uc2 New York Times\uc2  Opinion section on \uc2 Facebook\uc2  and \uc2 Twitter\uc2  (@NYTopinion), and sign up for the Opinion Today newsletter.\par \par \uc2 Matt Katz is a political reporter for WNYC and New Jersey Public Radio and is the author of ''American Governor: Chris Christie's Bridge to Redemption.''\par \par \uc2 DRAWING (DRAWING BY ADAM MAIDA) \par \par \uc2 Document NYTF000020161002eca20006n\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 CORRECTION APPENDEDIn recent years, one of the most important events on a prospective Republican presidential candidate's calendar was the RedState Gathering, a summer convention for conservative activists from across the nation. Its host was Erick Erickson, a round-faced, redheaded former \uc2 election\uc2  lawyer and city councilman in Macon, Ga., who began blogging in 2004 on a site called RedState.com.\par \par \uc2 Erickson, who is now 41, is a conservative absolutist who made his name in the mid-2000s by ''blowing up'' -- in the \uc2 Twitter\uc2  parlance he jovially employs -- Republican leaders he viewed as insufficiently principled. In 2005, he played a role in torpedoing the Supreme Court nomination of the White House counsel Harriet Miers, publishing damaging admissions from White House sources that Miers had not been properly vetted. Five years later, he chided the \uc2 National Rifle Association\uc2  for being too willing to compromise, labeling it ''a weak little girl of an organization.'' He was a sharp-tongued critic of \uc2 John McCain\uc2  and \uc2 Mitt Romney\uc2  during their presidential runs, characterizing the former as ''an angry old jackass'' and the latter as ''the Harriet Miers of 2012.''\par \par \uc2 Along the way, Erickson became one of the new kingmakers of the Tea Party-era G.O.P. A little-known Florida legislator and Senate hopeful named \uc2 Marco Rubio\uc2  reached out to him in 2009 when he was at 3 percent in the polls. A former Texas solicitor general, Ted Cruz, did the same in 2011. Rick Perry announced his 2012 presidential candidacy at Erickson's gathering. By 2015, a number of the coming cycle's aspirants -- Rubio, Cruz, Perry and Bobby Jindal -- had given him their personal cellphone numbers, and he had traded emails with Jeb Bush. And two months before that August's convention in Atlanta, a New York-based Republican consultant named Sam Nunberg reached out to Erickson to ask if he could accommodate one more speaker: \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Erickson watched coverage of \uc2 Trump\uc2 's stream-of-consciousness announcement at \uc2 Trump\uc2  Tower on June 16 and was not particularly impressed. On the syndicated radio show he broadcasts from Atlanta, he offered his assessment with a dismissive chuckle: ''I guess he's ready to be spoiler, not president.'' He had met \uc2 Trump\uc2  once before, in July 2011, when he visited the 26th floor of \uc2 Trump\uc2  Tower to interview the businessman and reality-TV-show star. \uc2 Trump\uc2  had spent the past few months flirting with a presidential run only to decide, as he told Erickson that day, ''I have a great show that's a big success, and it's hard to say, 'I'm gonna leave two hours of prime-time television in order to get beat up by people that don't know what they're doing.' ''\par \par \uc2 The hourlong conversation struck Erickson as pleasant but unmemorable. What did stick with him was their exchange as he was leaving \uc2 Trump\uc2  Tower. ''\uc2 Trump\uc2  asked me if I played golf,'' Erickson told me recently. ''And I said, 'Yeah, I'm terrible.' '' Then, he said, \uc2 Trump\uc2  asked if he would be interested in coming to \uc2 Trump\uc2 's golf-club in West Palm Beach, Fla., to play. ''I'm very flattered -- I've never been to West Palm Beach before,'' Erickson recalled. ''Several times, his office reached out. So finally I asked my wife, 'What do you think this is about?' She said, 'He wants to own your soul.' So I never went.''\par \par \uc2 Erickson did not see much of a political future for \uc2 Trump\uc2 , but he imagined that he might be good for ticket sales, if nothing else, at the RedState Gathering. He informed Nunberg that \uc2 Trump\uc2  could have a slot on the convention's second day.\par \par \uc2 The evening before he was to speak in Atlanta, \uc2 Trump\uc2  went on \uc2 CNN\uc2  and denounced the Fox News host Megyn Kelly for her sharp questioning of him during a recent debate, speculating that Kelly had ''blood coming out of her wherever.'' When Erickson saw the footage that evening, he called \uc2 Trump\uc2 's campaign manager, \uc2 Corey Lewandowski\uc2 , and rescinded \uc2 Trump\uc2 's invitation on the grounds that he would be too much of a distraction. ''And that was that,'' Erickson would later recall with a sheepish grin. ''Until the next day, when he's blowing me up.''\par \par \uc2 On \uc2 Twitter\uc2 , \uc2 Trump\uc2  called Erickson ''a major sleaze and buffoon'' and said that the ''small crowds'' at the gathering were due to his absence. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's supporters soon piled on. This was to be expected, but what surprised Erickson were the attacks from people he regarded as his fellow bomb-throwers in the conservative revolution. On \uc2 Twitter\uc2 , the talk-radio host and Fox News commentator Laura Ingraham mocked ''JebState.'' The author and right-wing provocateur Ann Coulter brought up some of Erickson's own crass utterances, like his characterization of the former Supreme Court justice David Souter in 2009 as a ''goat-[expletive] child molester.'' The next week, 30,000 readers of Erickson's email newsletter canceled their subscriptions.\par \par \uc2 Erickson dug in, writing that \uc2 Trump\uc2  was ''out of his depth'' and lacking in ''common decency.'' But he was drowned out by \uc2 Trump\uc2  sympathizers with even bigger audiences than his own, like The Drudge Report and the online outlet Breitbart. It was one of the first salvos in what would open up in the year that followed into a civil war within the conservative media, dividing some of the loudest voices on the right. Days earlier, Erickson had unimpeachable credentials in the conservative movement. But by crossing \uc2 Trump\uc2 , he was now, in the eyes of his former allies, ''a tool of the establishment.''\par \par \uc2 The conservative media has always been a playground for outsize personalities with even more outsize political ambitions. The National Review founder William F. Buckley fashioned much of the intellectual genetic code of the Reagan Revolution, while also writing fringe groups like the \uc2 John Birch Society\uc2  out of the conservative movement and, for good measure, running for mayor of New York against the liberal Republican John Lindsay. In 1996, the former Nixon media consultant Roger Ailes brought his attack-dog ethos to \uc2 Rupert Murdoch\uc2 's Fox News channel and built the network into a transformational power in Republican politics before his fall this year amid accusations of sexual harassment.\par \par \uc2 But alongside the institution-builders like Buckley and Ailes, the conservative-media landscape has also produced a class of rowdy entrepreneurs who wield their influence in more personal, protean ways. The godfathers mostly came to power in the 1990s: \uc2 Clinton\uc2 -administration antagonists like Rush Limbaugh, who began broadcasting nationally in 1988 and became talk radio's hegemonic power in the \uc2 Clinton\uc2  years, and Matt Drudge, who started his pioneering Drudge Report online in 1996.\par \par \uc2 If these figures defied the stuffy ceremony of the East Coast think tanks, opinion journals and bow-tied columnists who traditionally defined the conservative intelligentsia, they rarely challenged the ideological principles of conservatism as they had existed since the Reagan era: small government, low taxes, hawkish foreign policy and traditional social values. What they mostly did was provide the Republican Party with a set of exceptionally loud megaphones, which liberals have often envied and tried unsuccessfully to emulate. Conservative talk radio and Fox News now collectively reach an audience of as many as 50 million -- most of them elderly white Republicans with a high likelihood of turning out in \uc2 election\uc2  years. And this isn't even counting the like-minded online outlets that have flourished during the Obama years, thanks to a growing internet-media economy and a presidency, particularly in the case of the Affordable Care Act, that gave conservatives \uc2 common cause\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Then came \uc2 Trump\uc2 . In a sense, the divide that he has opened up among conservative media figures is simply a function of the heartburn his ascent has caused among Republicans more generally, pitting voter against voter, congressman against congressman, \uc2 Bob Dole\uc2  against the Bushes. Some conservative media outlets threw themselves behind \uc2 Trump\uc2  from the beginning, explaining away his more radioactive statements and his uneven-at-best record as a conservative. Breitbart, whose former chairman, Steve Bannon, is now \uc2 Trump\uc2 's chief strategist, was an ardent early supporter, breathlessly covering \uc2 Trump\uc2 's ascent in the polls and his smackdowns of ''low energy'' Jeb Bush and ''little Marco'' Rubio. But as \uc2 Trump\uc2  expanded into more sacrosanct targets -- Fox News's Kelly, George W. Bush's performance in the war on terror and Cruz -- the dissenting chorus among conservatism's dons grew louder. The Washington Post columnist Charles Krauthammer warned in December that \uc2 Trump\uc2  ''has managed to steer the entire G.O.P. campaign into absurdities.'' His Post colleague George Will predicted that a \uc2 Trump\uc2  nomination would mean the loss of conservatism ''as a constant presence in U.S. politics.'' The Weekly Standard editor William Kristol floated the idea of a new ''non-\uc2 Trump\uc2  non-\uc2 Clinton\uc2  party.'' And on the eve of the Iowa caucus, National Review devoted an entire issue to a single topic: ''Against \uc2 Trump\uc2 .''\par \par \uc2 Since \uc2 Trump\uc2  clinched the nomination, the dividing lines have become starker, the individual dilemmas more agonizing. Mark Levin, an influential talk-radio host, complains that among conservative commentators, \uc2 Trump\uc2 's message is endlessly repeated by what he derisively refers to as ''the Rockettes.'' But Levin, too, recently announced to his listeners that he intends to vote for \uc2 Trump\uc2 , if only to prevent another \uc2 Clinton\uc2  presidency. As he put it to me, ''I'm not going to be throwing confetti in the air if \uc2 Trump\uc2  wins,'' adding that he viewed the candidate as ''a liberal with some conservative viewpoints that he's not terribly reliable at sticking to.''\par \par \uc2 Others -- Sean Hannity, Ingraham, the former Reagan official and ''The Book of Virtues'' author William Bennett -- have thrown in for \uc2 Trump\uc2  with a brio that strikes some in the business as unseemly. ''Look, we're in the opinion business, but there's a distinction between that and being a Sean Hannity fanboy,'' the Milwaukee-based talk-radio host Charlie Sykes told me. ''It's been genuinely stunning to watch how they've become tools of his campaign and rationalizing everything he's done.''\par \par \uc2 ''For 20 years I've been saying how it's not true that talk radio is all about ratings and we don't believe what we say,'' he went on. ''Then you watch how the media types rolled over for him. Obviously \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  is very good for ratings, and at some point it's hard not to conclude they decided the \uc2 Trump\uc2  train was the gravy train. I've been thoroughly disillusioned, and I'm not alone in that. It's like watching 'Invasion of the Body Snatchers': Oh, my God, they got another one!''\par \par \uc2 When \uc2 Trump\uc2  declared his candidacy in June 2015, the part of his announcement speech that most clearly foreshadowed the campaign to come had to do with immigration. ''When Mexico sends its people, they're not sending their best,'' he told the crowd at \uc2 Trump\uc2  Tower. ''They're sending people that have lots of problems, and they're bringing those problems with us. They're bringing drugs. They're bringing crime. They're rapists.''\par \par \uc2 The line struck Sykes as awfully familiar when he heard it. A month before, he had run a segment with Ann Coulter, who had just published her 11th book, an anti-immigration screed titled ''\u161\'00\'A1Adios, America!'' Sykes was well aware of Coulter's views, but he was taken aback when she began a riff on Mexican rapists surging into the United States (a subject that takes up an entire chapter of ''\u161\'00\'A1Adios, America!''). ''I remember looking at my producer and going, 'Wow, this is rather extraordinary,' '' he told me. ''When \uc2 Trump\uc2  used that line, I instantly recognized it as Ann Coulter's.''\par \par \uc2 In fact, \uc2 Corey Lewandowski\uc2  had reached out to Coulter for advice in the run-up to \uc2 Trump\uc2 's announcement speech. The address \uc2 Trump\uc2  delivered on June 16 bore no resemblance to his prepared text, which contained a mere two sentences about immigration. Instead, he ad-libbed what Coulter today calls ''the Mexican rapist speech that won my heart.'' When \uc2 Trump\uc2 's remarks provoked fury, Lewandowski called Coulter for backup. Three days later, she went on HBO's ''Real Time With Bill Maher'' and, amid shrieks of laughter from the audience, predicted that \uc2 Trump\uc2  was the Republican candidate most likely to win the presidency.\par \par \uc2 One evening this past March, \uc2 Trump\uc2  received Coulter at Mar-a-Lago, his estate-turned-club in Palm Beach. Though in recent years the two had developed a rapport on \uc2 Twitter\uc2 , she had met him face to face only once before he declared his candidacy, a lunch date at \uc2 Trump\uc2  Tower in 2011. Over lunch, \uc2 Trump\uc2  gave Coulter the impression that he had read her books. He also gave her a few items from his wife's line of costume jewelry and told Coulter, who keeps a house in Palm Beach, that she was welcome to use the pool at Mar-a-Lago anytime.\par \par \uc2 The golf resort was the chief staging ground for \uc2 Trump\uc2 's charm offensives against the conservative media. Many of its members have visited at \uc2 Trump\uc2 's invitation in recent years, joining the resident Gatsby for steak and lobster on the patio, where \uc2 Trump\uc2  squints and appears to listen intently while his guests dispense political wisdom -- though it is never clear whether he is actually interested in it, simply flattering his guests or sizing them up. When I dined with him on the patio this spring, \uc2 Trump\uc2  asked me eagerly about how I liked his odds in the \uc2 election\uc2 . Later, on the campaign trail, I watched him solicit the same counsel from random stragglers on the rope line.\par \par \uc2 Coulter, at any rate, appeared immune to the whole routine. A week earlier, \uc2 Trump\uc2  bragged during a Republican presidential debate in Detroit that ''there's no problem'' with the size of his penis. On the patio, Coulter told the candidate that no one wanted to hear about his endowment. She told Lewandowski that he should buy a dozen teleprompters and put them in every room of \uc2 Trump\uc2 's house until he learned how to use them. Reminding \uc2 Trump\uc2  that she had been his earliest and most dedicated advocate, she told him: ''I'm the only one losing money trying to put you in the White House. You're going to listen to me.''\par \par \uc2 This appeal to the bottom line seemed to tweak \uc2 Trump\uc2 's conscience. He gave Coulter an open invitation to Mar-a-Lago, waiving the $100,000 membership fee. The following evening at the next Republican debate, he exhibited considerably more restraint, for which Coulter, with characteristic modesty, claims credit. ''Coulter delivers!'' she told me.\par \par \uc2 Some of \uc2 Trump\uc2 's supporters within the conservative media are attracted to his actual positions on issues. One is his trade policy, on which many media personalities on the right are considerably more populist and protectionist than Republican Party leaders and Chamber of Commerce boosters. Throughout Obama's presidency, Laura Ingraham has warned of China's predations: ''The trade war is on, and we're losing it,'' she has often said. For others, \uc2 Trump\uc2 's assurance that he will appoint Antonin Scalia-like conservatives to the Supreme Court is reason enough for their support.\par \par \uc2 But \uc2 Trump\uc2  also simply fulfills the ineffable urge many have to, as \uc2 Michael Needham\uc2 , the chief executive of the conservative policy group Heritage Action for America, puts it, ''punch Washington in the face.'' This is true for Coulter, who, in her newly published paean to the candidate, ''In \uc2 Trump\uc2  We Trust,'' writes that \uc2 Trump\uc2  is fit for the presidency not in spite of his crudeness but because of it: ''Only someone who brags about his airline's seatbelt buckles being made of solid gold would have the balls to do what \uc2 Trump\uc2  is doing.''\par \par \uc2 But what really sold Coulter on \uc2 Trump\uc2 , she told me, was his hard line on immigration. Coulter told me that she had never given the issue much thought during her childhood in New Canaan, Conn., and her student days at Cornell. Then in 1992, the British-American journalist Peter Brimelow wrote a 14,000-word essay for National Review titled ''Time to Rethink Immigration?'' which would later become a sort of ur-text for today's alt-right, the ascendant white-nationalist movement that has found its champion in \uc2 Trump\uc2 . Brimelow cast the current wave of American immigrants in dismal terms: less skilled, less European, less assimilated, less law-abiding and less Republican than the previous newcomers. Coulter, who was 31 and a law clerk at the time, remembers reading it and thinking, ''Oh, my gosh, I've been completely lied to!''\par \par \uc2 Twenty-four years later, Coulter helped formulate \uc2 Trump\uc2 's immigration-policy position, which she hailed on \uc2 Twitter\uc2  as ''the greatest political document since the Magna Carta.'' (Her additional tweet on the subject -- ''I don't care if @realDonaldTrump wants to perform abortions in the White House after this immigration policy paper'' -- prompted Mark Levin to tweet back, ''These have to be among the most pathetic comments of anyone in a long time.'')\par \par \uc2 Coulter has not always gotten her way with the candidate. At Mar-a-Lago that evening in March, she lobbied unsuccessfully for him to pick as his running mate Kris Kobach, the secretary of state of Kansas, who is credited with selling \uc2 Mitt Romney\uc2  on ''self-deportation.'' And her book tour for ''In \uc2 Trump\uc2  We Trust'' hit a momentary snag when \uc2 Trump\uc2  told Sean Hannity that he would be open to ''softening'' his immigration stance, though Coulter chose to believe that, as she told me, ''it was Hannity badgering him.''\par \par \uc2 Still, she has become the \uc2 Trump\uc2  campaign's most unrepentant brawler. When Khzir Khan, the Pakistani-American father of a U.S. Army captain who was killed in combat in Iraq, spoke critically of \uc2 Trump\uc2  at the Democratic National Convention, Coulter wrote on \uc2 Twitter\uc2 : ''You know what this convention really needed: An angry Muslim with a thick accent like Fareed Zacaria[sic].''\par \par \uc2 That tweet provoked disgust from fellow conservatives, among them Erick Erickson, who tweeted: ''What a terrible thing to say about a man whose son died for this country.'' When I reminded Coulter of Erickson's scolding, she let out a hearty laugh. ''I always hated him,'' she said. ''This is one of the fantastic things. In any political movement, there are many people you think are losers and dorks, but your friends talk you into liking them, because they're on our side. Now all of those people are out.''\par \par \uc2 Sighing, she said, ''\uc2 Trump\uc2  has made my life better in so many ways.''\par \par \uc2 You will not find copies of ''\u161\'00\'A1Adios, America!'' or ''In \uc2 Trump\uc2  We Trust'' on any of the many bookshelves in the home of the Washington Post columnist George Will. A week after Ted Cruz dropped out of the Republican presidential race in early May, Will and his wife, Mari, a Republican political consultant, gave a catered dinner party for Cruz and his wife, Heidi. The other guests were conservative donors, activists and journalists, along with their spouses. The Wills have been hosting these off-the-record encounters with political celebrities at their Maryland home for decades. In early 2009, Will's fellow conservative columnists gathered there to meet Obama a week before his inauguration.\par \par \uc2 Among the guests that evening in May was Laura Ingraham. Ingraham is of proudly working-class heritage -- her mother was a waitress for almost 30 years and her father owned and operated a Coin-a-Matic carwash -- and does not share Will's reverence for decorum. She was an early defender of \uc2 Trump\uc2 's willingness to say things ''no one else is saying.'' While interviewing Cruz on her radio show six weeks before the Wills' party, she interrupted him to mock his Harvard Law degree. Still, Cruz knew that his political future relied on conservative opinion-makers like Ingraham, and it was at his request that the Wills included her in the party.\par \par \uc2 Over cocktails, the Cruzes spoke fondly of their experiences on the campaign trail, and the other guests listened politely, mindful of Cruz's recent humiliating defeat. Then midway through dinner, at a table set with glasses once used by Abraham Lincoln, Ingraham insisted that Cruz needed to throw his weight behind the man who had branded him ''Lyin' Ted.'' ''If you don't endorse him, where does that leave you?'' she said. ''You don't have the public and you don't have the establishment. How can you be a leader of the conservative movement?''\par \par \uc2 Cruz amiably replied that such a decision did not have to be made right away. Others at the table joined in to defend him, but Ingraham would hear nothing of it. ''You can't want \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  elected,'' she goaded him.\par \par \uc2 Will sat fuming silently. ''She was quite animated,'' he would later recall. Cruz refused to offer his support to \uc2 Trump\uc2  that night or in the weeks to follow. Speaking at the Republican convention on July 20 moments before Cruz was to do the same, Ingraham taunted him: ''We should all, even all you boys with wounded feelings and bruised egos -- and we love you, we love you -- but you must honor the pledge to support \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  now, tonight!'' The following morning on her radio show, Ingraham declared that Cruz's refusal to endorse had ''effectively ended his political career.''\par \par \uc2 Will was no more persuaded by Ingraham than Cruz was. The first and only time Will met \uc2 Trump\uc2  was in March 1995, when, at \uc2 Trump\uc2 's invitation, he gave a speech at Mar-a-Lago. Years later on \uc2 Twitter\uc2 , \uc2 Trump\uc2  would ascribe Will's harsh view of him to Will's having ''totally bombed'' with his performance that night. Will told me: ''He started telling this story: 'The reason Will doesn't like me is I invited him to give a speech at Mar-a-Lago, and I knew it was going to be boring, so I waited out on the patio.' Which raises two questions. First, if he knew it was going to be that boring, why did he invite me? And second, who would be the guy with the orange hair sitting in the front row?''\par \par \uc2 Will said on ABC's ''This Week'' in 2012 that \uc2 Trump\uc2  was ''a bloviating ignoramus'' and he has spent much of the past year predicting the candidate's imminent political demise. ''I thought even an entertaining bore could be a bore after a while,'' he told me. By late December of last year, however, his contempt had given way to alarm. ''Conservatives' highest priority,'' he wrote in a Post column, ''must be to prevent \uc2 Trump\uc2  from winning the Republican nomination'' -- even if it meant \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's \uc2 election\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Then on June 2, three weeks after his dinner party for Cruz, Will learned that his friend and fellow Republican \uc2 Paul Ryan\uc2 , the House speaker, had endorsed the nominee. Will considered the matter over martinis at home that evening. The next morning, he walked into his office and told his assistant: ''Go change my registration. This is not my party anymore.''\par \par \uc2 Recently I visited Will at his office, a three-story Georgetown brick rowhouse erected in 1811. Its walls are covered with framed photographs, several of them depicting the writer in his youth alongside Reagan and other titans of his former party. The dean of conservative pundits, now 75, wore a crisp pinstripe shirt and gray slacks, his customary owlish Mona Lisa expression a bit tighter than usual, owing to the subject matter. Will told me that he cast his first vote in 1964, for Barry Goldwater. He voted for the Republican candidate in every succeeding presidential \uc2 election\uc2 , until now.\par \par \uc2 ''I don't use the word 'frightening' often,'' he told me. ''But it's frightening to know this person'' -- \uc2 Trump\uc2  -- ''would have the nuclear-launch codes. The world is getting really dangerous. His friend Mr. Putin is dismantling a nation in the center of Europe. Some trigger-happy captain of a Chinese boat with ship-to-ship missiles might make a mistake in the next three years near the Spratly Islands. All kinds of things can go wrong. And the idea that this guy will be asked to respond in a sober, firm way? My goodness.''\par \par \uc2 He seemed genuinely despondent. ''Given that, could you see yourself urging your readers to vote for \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 ?'' I asked.\par \par \uc2 Will's lips pursed slightly. ''Well,'' he said, ''it's clear from everything I've written that I think she'd be a better president. That said, I'm not going to vote for her. First of all, I'm a Maryland voter. She couldn't lose Maryland if she tried.''\par \par \uc2 ''Then. ...''\par \par \uc2 ''I haven't decided,'' he said. ''You can imagine -- I get tons of emails: 'I, too, have left the Republican Party. What should I do?' Well, there are a number of legitimate options. Not voting is a legitimate expression of opinion.''\par \par \uc2 Ingraham and other conservative media personalities hailed \uc2 Trump\uc2  for having ''tapped into'' a shared and seething disquiet among predominantly white, non-college-educated voters. ''What I don't understand on the part of those being tapped into,'' Will told me, ''is: What exactly do they want? I can think of nothing the American people have wanted intensely and protractedly that they didn't get. Took a while, but they got it.''\par \par \uc2 With a resigned half-smirk, he looked at the ground and intoned, in the manner of a hostage-video monologue: ''It's gonna be yuge. And it's all gonna get fixed. And we're all gonna be winners.''\par \par \uc2 ''If he doesn't build that wall, I'm pissed,'' Sean Hannity told me, reflecting on the prospects of a \uc2 Trump\uc2  presidency in the office of his radio show in Midtown Manhattan. ''If he doesn't repeal Obamacare, I'm gonna be pissed. If he appoints a liberal jurist to the Supreme Court, I'm gonna lose my mind. And by the way: I'll be screaming. Not talking -- screaming about it. But in fairness, if \uc2 Trump\uc2  doesn't keep his promises, you can also blame me, because I believed him.''\par \par \uc2 Although Coulter was \uc2 Trump\uc2 's earliest cheerleader among prominent conservative-media personalities, Hannity's stake in the \uc2 election\uc2  perhaps runs deepest of all, if only because of the size of his audience. He hosts the second-highest-rated show (after Limbaugh) on talk radio and the third-highest-rated program (after Bill O'Reilly and Megyn Kelly) on cable news. More than 2.4 million weekly viewers and 13 million listeners have witnessed Hannity sticking his neck out on behalf of a first-time politician and sometime Republican who has voiced support for \uc2 Planned Parenthood\uc2  while vowing to limit America's military footprint and shred trade deals that the G.O.P. has backed for decades.\par \par \uc2 Hannity's critics on the right have accused him of essentially running hourlong daily \uc2 Trump\uc2  infomercials. When I asked him about this, Hannity responded with a well-rehearsed litany of sins perpetrated by the Republican establishment in concert with Obama: perilously low labor participation and homeownership rates, soaring national debt, Obamacare and so on. A \uc2 Clinton\uc2  presidency, he warned, would be ''Obama on steroids.'' These were his motivations. ''My conscience is clear. And I feel like \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  would be a great president.''\par \par \uc2 Hannity told me that he had in fact never stayed at a \uc2 Trump\uc2  hotel property, played on a \uc2 Trump\uc2  golf course or visited Mar-a-Lago. ''I have my own place -- on the other Florida coast, in Naples,'' he said. ''I don't need his place. I always got the sense people were asking him for something. I don't believe in asking for free stuff.''\par \par \uc2 Nonetheless, the two men have a mutual affinity that has spanned at least two decades. The MSNBC ''Morning Joe'' host and former Republican congressman Joe Scarborough theorized to me that their relationship has a psychological underpinning: ''\uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2 , Sean Hannity, Bill O'Reilly all share the same resentment that they will never be accepted into Manhattan's polite society no matter what they do.'' (\uc2 Trump\uc2  is from Queens; Hannity and O'Reilly are from Long Island.) \uc2 Trump\uc2 , in a recent phone conversation, offered me a somewhat simpler explanation: ''Sean likes having me on his show, and that has to do with ratings more than anything else.''\par \par \uc2 No presidential candidate in history, Hannity told me, understands television better than \uc2 Trump\uc2  -- ''not even close.'' On this score, I couldn't disagree. One evening this past spring, on his plane after a campaign event in Buffalo, \uc2 Trump\uc2  told me that at rallies, he always made a point of finding the TV cameras at the back of the media pen and noticing whether a red light was flickering. ''That means they're airing it live,'' he explained. ''So I make sure to say something new'' -- by which he meant newsworthy, the better to own the next news cycle.\par \par \uc2 Trump\uc2  was a TV star for more than a decade before he became a politician; he watches TV news incessantly and understands the medium intimately. He knows the optimal time slots on the morning shows. He stage-manages the on-set lighting. He is not only on speaking terms with every network chief executive but also knows their booking agents. He monitors the opinions of hosts and regular guests more avidly than most media critics do and works them obsessively, often directly.\par \par \uc2 Scarborough told me that \uc2 Trump\uc2 's family -- particularly \uc2 Ivanka \uc2 Trump\uc2 's husband, \uc2 Jared Kushner\uc2  -- sometimes asked him for advice, and more than once ''called me and asked me to get him off the ledge. I've said, 'I can do that, but six hours later he's going to revert to form.' I told Jared at one point: 'Jared, your father-in-law listens to me more when I'm attacking him on television than when I'm trying to convince him to be rational for the sake of the party.' I think he's a creature of TV.''\par \par \uc2 TV networks, in the mainstream as well as conservative media, have profited handsomely from \uc2 Trump\uc2 's \uc2 election\uc2 -season theatrics, but some of their on-air personalities like Hannity are drawn to him for reasons apart from ratings. The prospect of getting in on the ground floor of a \uc2 Trump\uc2  administration that is short on policy ideas and disdainful of old Washington hands amounts to a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. By employing the Breitbart publisher Steve Bannon, and by including both Ingraham and Roger Ailes in his debate preparations, \uc2 Trump\uc2  has implicitly encouraged the conservative media to consider itself part of the campaign team.\par \par \uc2 I asked Hannity if it was true that, as a \uc2 Trump\uc2  confidant had told me, he wished to be considered as a potential \uc2 Trump\uc2  White House chief of staff. ''That's news to me,'' he insisted, adding a politician's practiced nondenial denial: ''I have radio and TV contracts that I will honor through December 2020.'' Nonetheless, Hannity's service to the \uc2 Trump\uc2  campaign well exceeds that of ritually bashing \uc2 Clinton\uc2  and giving \uc2 Trump\uc2  free airtime. He has offered private strategic advice to the campaign. The same \uc2 Trump\uc2  confidant told me of at least one instance in which Hannity drafted an unsolicited memo outlining the message \uc2 Trump\uc2  should offer after the Orlando nightclub shooting in June. In public, Hannity has made it his mission to warn fellow conservatives -- naming names, like the columnist Jonah Goldberg and the National Review editor in chief Rich Lowry -- that if they do not soon climb aboard the \uc2 Trump\uc2  train they will, as the hashtag threatens, #OwnIt: \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's picks for the Supreme Court, her response to the Islamic State, her trade deals, all of it.\par \par \uc2 Hannity maintains that his scolding of \uc2 Trump\uc2 's conservative dissenters derives from his fear of a \uc2 Clinton\uc2  presidency. ''It'd be pretty much over,'' he said. Taken alone, George Will or even National Review might have little impact on \uc2 Trump\uc2 's standing in the race, Hannity argued, but ''cumulatively they do. I can look at the poll numbers. If you go back to a month ago, he was garnering 73 percent of the Republican vote. The most recent, I think he had 88 percent. He needs to get to 93.'' And the key to the last 5 percent might very well lie with the noisy holdouts, like Erick Erickson.\par \par \uc2 On Sept. 16, Erickson showed up at the \uc2 National Press Club in Washington\uc2  to participate in a debate sponsored by the \uc2 National Religious Broadcasters\uc2 . Erickson left RedState at the end of last year to concentrate on his radio show and his online opinion journal, The Resurgent, but he has remained influential among conservatives who do not support \uc2 Trump\uc2 . In July, when he learned that Ted Cruz was about to have a private meeting with the nominee on the eve of the convention, Erickson texted the senator: ''Don't endorse! Don't endorse!'' Later that evening, Erickson says, Cruz texted back: ''Didn't endorse! Didn't endorse!'' (Cruz finally announced that he would vote for \uc2 Trump\uc2  on Sept. 23.)\par \par \uc2 The subject of the debate, inevitably, was \uc2 Trump\uc2 : specifically, whether evangelical Christians should support him. Being a lifelong evangelical himself, Erickson had some thoughts on the matter. Over the years, he had been condemned for his own offensive words, like the time he called the Texas gubernatorial candidate Wendy Davis ''Abortion Barbie.'' But he had recently apologized for many (though not all) of these statements and had called upon \uc2 Trump\uc2  to affect a similar posture of Christian humility. ''1 Corinthians is very explicit,'' he told me. ''If someone holds one's self out to be a Christian and doesn't behave that way, Christians are supposed to judge him. This is a guy who's bragged about his affairs.''\par \par \uc2 This was Erickson's principal argument during the debate. \uc2 Trump\uc2  was not merely a sinner, he said, but a gleefully unrepentant one. Erickson's debate opponent, the Christian talk-show host and fervent \uc2 Trump\uc2  supporter Janet Parshall, responded by reciting a litany of sinners in chief -- from Thomas Jefferson with the out-of-wedlock child he fathered with a slave, to Warren G. Harding with his multiple liaisons, to Richard Nixon with his foul language memorialized on the White House tapes. ''We are not electing a messiah,'' Parshall said. ''Last time I checked, he was appointed to office and he is not term-limited.''\par \par \uc2 Erickson's debating partner, the conservative activist Bill Wichterman, argued that \uc2 Trump\uc2  appealed to the worst in America: His bullying, his lying and his bigotry were ''corrosive to our national character.'' Erickson could testify to this. At one point, he was receiving as many as 300 emails a day from \uc2 Trump\uc2  supporters. Some of them referred to him as a ''cuck'' or ''cuck-servative.'' The word -- a masculinity-insulting derivative of ''cuckold'' -- was new to Erickson, as were its originators in the white-nationalist alt-right.\par \par \uc2 More than one of the emails predicted that Erickson would be shot to death. At the local grocery store, a man walked up to Erickson's two young children ''and told them they needed to know their father was destroying this country by supporting \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 ,'' Erickson told me. And one evening, two people showed up on the Ericksons' doorstep to deliver a threat -- Erickson would not tell me what it was -- explicit enough that he later hired security guards. ''I've never had Obama or Romney or McCain or \uc2 Clinton\uc2  supporters come to my home or send me nasty letters,'' he said.\par \par \uc2 Did \uc2 Trump\uc2  beget all of this? If so, what begot \uc2 Trump\uc2 ? Erickson argued that the fault lay with Beltway Republicans. ''They've broken so many promises,'' he said. ''They promised to defund the president's immigration plan. They promised to defund Obamacare. They promised to fight the president on raising the debt limit. At some point, the base of the party just wants to burn the house down and start over.''\par \par \uc2 But even Erickson did not seem convinced that this alone explained what he saw as a nihilistic turn among Republican voters. ''I do think there are a lot of people that have just concluded that this is it -- that if we don't get the \uc2 election\uc2  right, the country's over,'' he said. As to where they might have gotten that idea, Erickson knew the answer. It was the apocalyptic hymn sung by talk-radio hosts like his friend and mentor Rush Limbaugh, whose show Erickson once guest-hosted, though in the time of \uc2 Trump\uc2 , it seemed unlikely he would receive another invitation.\par \par \uc2 This February, Limbaugh, who has applauded \uc2 Trump\uc2  without endorsing him outright, posed to Erickson the question of whether a commentator should try to act as ''the guardian of what it means to be a conservative.'' In effect, the legend of talk radio was laying down an unwritten commandment of the trade, which applies as well to cable TV: Do not attempt to lead your following.\par \par \uc2 This was simple enough for an avowed \uc2 Trump\uc2  supporter like Ingraham. ''Laura's never missed an opportunity to build her career on the backs of others,'' Erickson told me. He counted Hannity as another mentor and admired his entrepreneurial cunning, saying: ''Sean reflects his audience. He's not going to leave his audience.'' On his own radio show, Erickson found that the more he denounced \uc2 Trump\uc2 , the more female listeners he picked up. But most of the 300,000 people who tuned in weekly during rush hour were men. While Erickson refused to abandon his principles, he did not wish to go broke, either.\par \par \uc2 On Sept. 20, Erickson wrote a long post for The Resurgent titled ''Reconsidering My Opposition to \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2 .'' He made no effort to disguise his moroseness. ''I see the \uc2 election\uc2  of \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  as the antithesis of all my values and ideas on what fosters sound civil society in this country,'' he wrote, and described his manifold objections to her at great length. But, he went on, ''I have to admit that while I may view \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's campaign as anti-American, I view \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2 's campaign as un-American. ... While I see \uc2 Clinton\uc2  as having no virtue, I see \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  corrupting the virtuous and fostering hatred, racism and dangerous strains of nationalism.'' The \uc2 election\uc2  left him adrift. ''I am without a candidate. I just cannot vote for either one.''\par \par \uc2 And so Erickson's conscience led him back to where he was 13 months ago. Nowadays, he told me, he was doing all he could to avoid discussing \uc2 Trump\uc2  and the \uc2 election\uc2  altogether -- a tall order for a talk-radio host. Responding to my look of bewilderment, he said, ''Why dwell on the train wreck?''\par \par \uc2 Erickson believed he was not alone. ''People know where we're headed, don't like where we're headed and would rather talk about something else,'' he said. Erickson had won many fights. This one was the biggest yet, and he had lost. There was nothing left to do but step back from his megaphone, dwell on happier matters and wait for the next righteous cause.\par \par \uc2 Sign up for our newsletter to get the best of The \uc2 New York Times Magazine\uc2  delivered to your inbox every week.\par \par \uc2 Correction: October 16, 2016, Sunday\par \par \uc2 This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article on Oct. 2 about the conservative media's reaction to \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2 's presidential candidacy misstated the rank of Sean Hannity's Fox News show among the highest-rated cable news shows.

(The \uc2 Trump\uc2  International Golf Club is in West Palm Beach.) And the article referred incorrectly to Ann Coulter's book ''\u161\'00\'A1Adios, America!''

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Sometimes the gender gap has been yuge and sometimes more modestly endowed, but for months now men have remained pretty much for \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2  and women for \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 . Last week's debate, when Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  got a chance to bring up her opponent's habit of calling women pigs, slobs and dogs, did nothing to narrow that divide.\par \par \uc2 But the danger of focusing, as we so often do, on the differences between men and women is that it assumes women themselves are all on the same page.\par \par \uc2 In fact, we are less a monolith and more a monster sorority, patched together from disparate viewpoints and dissimilar experiences. A New York Times/CBS News poll last month found instances of a sisterhood gap that in some ways is more revealing than the gender gap.\par \par \uc2 In addition to gauging views on the \uc2 election\uc2 , the poll asked women how they viewed their lives, their roles in society and society's views about them. Along with the expected differences between Republicans and Democrats, the biggest differences were between black and white women and between younger and older women.\par \par \uc2 Take the issue of leadership. Black women are far more likely than white women to see themselves as leaders -- by a margin of 40 percent to 26 percent. Correspondingly, they are much more likely to be glad a woman is on the presidential ticket (80 percent to 57 percent) and that the woman in question is Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 This could well be connected to material realities: 71 percent of employed black women said they are the primary wage earners in their households, compared with 48 percent of white women who work. And yet the women themselves had their own explanations.\par \par \uc2 Carla Lytle, 52, manages \uc2 election\uc2  officials for the \uc2 Election\uc2  Commission in Shelby County, Tenn. She was one of the African-American survey participants who saw herself as a leader. Raising her eight children was something of an apprenticeship, she said in a follow-up interview. ''When you're a parent and you're molding lives, and you walk through issues with your children,'' she said, ''it's a 24/7 job, it's not just a 9-to-5 job. That prepares you. A lot of people say, 'You have so much patience and understanding but yet you still get the job done.' And I think you can take that from the home to the workplace.''\par \par \uc2 Marcia Tucker, another 52-year-old African-American woman who sees herself as a leader, directs two public health management programs in Philadelphia. Ms. Tucker attributed her view in part to having had a chance ''to work for a period of time under a woman's leadership where I was able to get promotions and equal pay to my male counterparts.'' The equal pay was not simply policy, she said. ''I definitely did some advocating for myself.''\par \par \uc2 There were also pronounced differences in how black and white women saw the importance of appearance. In the survey women were asked to place a value on success at work; religion or spirituality; education; and appearance. They were first asked how important these things were to them personally, and then how important they were for women as society viewed them.\par \par \uc2 Most white women placed success at work and education well above appearance and spirituality to them personally, while most black women rated all four as ''very important'' to them. When the question switched to society's views, however, women had much more in common: Appearance shot to the top of the heap for everyone.\par \par \uc2 Lorraine Rawls, 58, an African-American accountant from Landover, Md., who had rated appearance as very important, said in an interview: ''Women need to take more pride in themselves and how they look.'' She added: ''I do think appearance plays a major part in the workplace, but it doesn't take away from your knowledge or what you're doing.'' A friend of hers is wearing her hair ''totally natural, but she walks into her boardroom with her suit and heels and still gets the job done.''\par \par \uc2 One other group was almost as likely as black women to say that their own appearance was very important to them: women over 64.\par \par \uc2 ''I don't know if wearing a uniform when I was raised in an orphanage by nuns has anything to do with it, but I've always watched how I was dressed,'' said Patricia Yolas-Wulffen, 73, a white retired engineer from Pine Mountain, Calif. ''If you work in an office I still think women should be dressed in pantsuits and skirts and heels.''\par \par \uc2 We expected to see gaps between older and younger women. The ''Bernie revolution'' suggested that younger women would be more critical of Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , but that was not the case. Millennials are more likely than baby boomers to say that a \uc2 Clinton\uc2  presidency would be ''good for women,'' and about twice as likely as women over 64 to say that Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  is judged more harshly because she is a woman. Women ages 18 to 29 are also much more likely than women over 64 to say that men in general have advantages over women (58 percent to 38 percent).\par \par \uc2 ''The main thing is that women still don't get equal pay for equal work,'' Christine Southworth, 38, a composer and musician in Lexington, Mass., said in a follow-up interview. ''And of course there is still discrimination and harassment in the workplace.''\par \par \uc2 M. J. Shannon, 65, gives the advantage to women. ''I just got designated as a minority-owned business so I can get more contracts with the city of Houston,'' Ms. Shannon, a white woman who runs a company selling books and supplies to school districts, said about a Housing and Urban Development program. ''I have a male friend who owns exactly the same kind of business, and he used to make more money than I did until they brought in this HUD thing, and now he is not doing as well as I am because he is a white male.''\par \par \uc2 Asked whether more had been done in the last 20 years to combat racism or sexism, women, black and white, said by about a two to one margin that more had been done to combat sexism. But there was a sisterhood gap here, too. Women over 64 were more likely than any other demographic to say that less had been done to combat sexism.\par \par \uc2 Racism and sexism are ''extremely ingrained in our society,'' said Joyce Coleman, 71, an African-American woman from Southfield, Mich., who is a retired consultant. But she feels ''there's been more progress on the racism part.''\par \par \uc2 ''I think racism is easier to define and better understood by the majority of people, and sexism can be so subjective that it is murky for a lot of people,'' said Barbara Jedlicka, 68, a white retired nurse in Las Vegas.\par \par \uc2 As complicated as our monster sorority can be, there are many times when its different constituencies agree or at least understand one another. Kaylyn Koberna, a 26-year-old Democrat from Doylestown, Penn., watched the recent debate with her mother. She thinks women her age have it easier. ''People starting out now,'' she said, ''even if they don't come into a perfectly just world, are going to have a lot of tools to put themselves closer to equal footing. My mom's generation and older were dealing with the hand they were dealt, but my generation has a pretty good shot.''\par \par \uc2 We'll see, sister.

\par\par \uc2 360 VIEW\par \uc2 Real Estate Desk; SECTRE\par \b \uc2 When a Building Says No to Signs\b0\par\par\uc2 By RONDA KAYSEN \par \uc2 1,090 \uc2 words\par \uc2 2 October 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 4\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 In July, Rebecca and Shirley Solomon, two sisters who have shared a TriBeCa loft for the better part of 40 years, hung a sign in their window for \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 . In other \uc2 election\uc2  years, they had hung signs for Barack Obama and placards opposing George W. Bush and the Iraq war. But this time, their exercise in political engagement was thwarted.\par \par \uc2 Two weeks after the sign went up, their landlord told them to take Hillary down.\par \par \uc2 The building had converted from a rental to a condominium, and the condo board had new rules about window d\u233\'00\'E9cor, prohibiting residents from putting signs of any kind in their windows.\par \par \uc2 The sisters were dejected. ''With our old landlords, we were pretty much allowed to get away with murder,'' said Rebecca Solomon, who has lived in the Beach Street loft with her sister on and off since 1978.\par \par \uc2 The new regime is far less lenient. Their landlord, as the owner of the apartment, is beholden to the condo association's rules, passing its orders along to the Solomon sisters, who are rent-stabilized tenants. ''Don't I have a First Amendment right?'' Rebecca Solomon asked.\par \par \uc2 She might not. The First Amendment, a cornerstone of the United States Constitution, does not necessarily protect a person on private property. In New York State, a homeowner can, theoretically, display signs of any political persuasion. But people living in condos, co-ops and privately owned rental buildings answer to a higher power: the owner of the building.\par \par \uc2 A renter's lease might restrict what objects can be placed in windows. Owners of condo and co-op apartments must follow the rules of the condo association or the co-op board. Like a landlord, a condo or co-op board can enforce building rules, including those that prohibit window displays like holiday lights or signs of any kind.\par \par \uc2 ''There would not be a constitutional right to post your sign if the landlord is saying no,'' said Christopher Dunn, the associate legal director at the New York Civil Liberties Union.\par \par \uc2 Rent-stabilized tenants, however, have some protections. Under rent-stabilization law, a landlord cannot evict a tenant for a window sign, according to David E. Frazer, a lawyer who represents tenants. But if you resist your landlord's demands, he might take you to court, which carries risks. To keep peace with a landlord who's ''actually been a pretty nice guy to work with,'' Rebecca Solomon took the sign down, she said.\par \par \uc2 Stroll the streets of Brownstone Brooklyn, where many residents own their properties, and you will invariably see signs supporting or opposing national and local causes -- like saving a Brooklyn Heights library branch or the view of the Brooklyn Bridge. In Manhattan, where most people live in apartments, such displays are rare.\par \par \uc2 Silence has a price. The humble act of hanging a window placard gives an average citizen a voice in a political landscape dominated by players with deep pockets. A yard or window sign is an inexpensive way to participate. Such signs ''have been a historic way that residents can express their political views,'' said Jeanne LoCicero, the deputy legal director at the American Civil Liberties Union of New Jersey. ''You're putting yourself out there, and in that way it's unique.'' But for millions of New Yorkers living in multifamily buildings, that option is off the table.\par \par \uc2 Unless, of course, you own the building. Consider 337 Lafayette Street, a construction site owned by the developer \uc2 Aby Rosen\uc2 . Since August, it has been wrapped in a green barrier emblazoned with the phrase ''Vote Your Conscience,'' a nod to Ted Cruz, who uttered the words at the Republican National Convention before endorsing \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  in late September. The sign could also be read as a jibe at \uc2 Jared Kushner\uc2 , Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's son-in-law, whose company owns the nearby Puck building.\par \par \uc2 Paradoxically, 337 Lafayette Street was once known as the Peace Pentagon because the building traditionally housed left-leaning tenants like the Granny Peace Brigade and the Socialist Party USA. Those tenants were displaced after Mr. Rosen bought the property for $20.75 million in 2015.\par \par \uc2 Sometimes, even ownership does not guarantee political expression. In February, Joseph Hornick, a retired firefighter, hung two flags bearing Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's slogan ''Make America Great Again'' outside his house in West Long Branch, N.J. They were the first campaign flags Mr. Hornick had ever flown. ''I was proud to put those flags up,'' he said. Until declaring his support for Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , he had hung only the American flag of 1815, the year his home was built.\par \par \uc2 In March, Mr. Hornick received a citation for violating a town ordinance restricting the display of political signs to 30 days before an \uc2 election\uc2  and five days after. He faced a fine of up to $2,000 or 90 days in jail, or both, although it was unlikely he would have received such a stiff punishment from the municipal court for a first offense, according to his lawyers.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Hornick was not deterred. ''I would have done a year in jail,'' he said. ''I was only concerned about who was going to guard my flags.'' (Vandals had repeatedly stolen them, but Mr. Hornick replaced them with new ones from \uc2 eBay\uc2 .)\par \par \uc2 The story ''took on a life of its own,'' said Mr. Hornick, who soon became a local celebrity in his community near the Jersey Shore as news outlets took notice. By May, the case had been dismissed. In June, the town repealed the ordinance.\par \par \uc2 This kind of ordinance ''is probably more common than you think,'' said Eric D. Sherman, a Manhattan lawyer who represented Mr. Hornick pro bono, along with the ACLU of New Jersey. ''People aren't aware that it's unconstitutional.''\par \par \uc2 Towns can place some restrictions on the political signs that homeowners put on their properties, but they cannot outright ban them, and the ordinance that essentially prohibited signs for 11 months a year in Mr. Hornick's town constituted an unreasonable ban, according to Ms. LoCicero of the ACLU of New Jersey.\par \par \uc2 In New Jersey, unlike in New York, condo and homeowners associations cannot prohibit political signs, although they, too, can impose some limitations. Nevertheless, restrictive and potentially unconstitutional rules remain on the books, unless someone pushes back. ''It's kind of like playing Whack-A-Mole,'' Ms. LoCicero said. ''Every four years, we find out about these bans.''\par \par \uc2 DRAWING (DRAWING BY SHONAGH RAE) \par \par \uc2 Document NYTF000020161002eca20009i\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 ECONOMIC VIEW\par \uc2 Money and Business/Financial Desk; SECTBU\par \b \uc2 Who's Afraid of \uc2 Trump\uc2 ? The Markets\b0\par\par\uc2 By JUSTIN WOLFERS \par \uc2 1,317 \uc2 words\par \uc2 2 October 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 5\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Wall Street fears a \uc2 Trump\uc2  presidency. Stocks may lose 10 to 12 percent of their value if he wins the November \uc2 election\uc2 , and there may be a broader economic downturn.\par \par \uc2 These conclusions arise from close analysis of financial markets during Monday's presidential debate, which provides a fascinating case study of the complex interconnections between American politics and economics. The market's judgment stands in sharp opposition to \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's claims that his presidency would be good for business.\par \par \uc2 Decoding these market signals is no easy task because it is difficult to disentangle correlation from causation. Ideally we would observe stock prices in parallel universes with identical economic conditions, with a single exception: In one, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  has a good shot at becoming president, while in the other, his chances are low.\par \par \uc2 Monday's presidential debate provided a rough approximation of this experiment. At 9 p.m., before the debate began, the betting markets gave Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  a 35 percent chance of becoming president. Two hours later, after the debate, we had entered the parallel universe in which economic conditions were the same, but Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's chances had fallen a tad below 30 percent.\par \par \uc2 During the debate, the overnight futures markets rallied, raising the value of broad stock market gauges like the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index by two-thirds to three-quarters of a percentage point. This was a consequential move, and because it was driven by the reduced chance of a \uc2 Trump\uc2  presidency, it reveals that the market believes that stocks would be worth more if he were to lose the \uc2 election\uc2 . Four pieces of evidence support this interpretation.\par \par \uc2 First, the rally played out in virtual lock step with Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's debate performance. When Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  pummeled him over his tax returns, stocks rose. And this pattern of stocks rising in response to Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's miscues continued through the evening.\par \par \uc2 Second, the rally occurred between 9 and 11 p.m. on a Monday, typically a fairly tranquil time and, in this case, a stretch in which there was no other important economic or financial news. This suggests that the rally was not driven by other factors. Lisa Brown, principal at Gorgon Capital Research, said, ''The only thing going on that would move markets in this time frame would be the debate.''\par \par \uc2 Third, the rise in stock prices was unusually large for that particular time period -- larger than during the same window on all but one of the 200 previous Mondays. It appears to be a statistically significant move, not one caused by mere chance.\par \par \uc2 Finally, a particularly large rise in the value of the Mexican peso paralleled the rise in S.&P. 500 stock futures. The peso move, which appears to be linked to the reduced likelihood of Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's being able to put into effect his immigration and trade proposals, also suggests that the financial markets' reaction was a judgment that Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  lost the debate.\par \par \uc2 All told, it appears that Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's apparently declining political fortunes drove stocks higher. This implies that the market expects better times if Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  becomes president. If Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  stages a comeback in the next debates, expect stocks to fall sharply.\par \par \uc2 How much better would the market perform under a President \uc2 Clinton\uc2  than a President \uc2 Trump\uc2 ?\par \par \uc2 Consider the rise in stock futures. At first blush, an increase of less than 1 percent doesn't sound like much. But it points to something much bigger. After all, if a relatively small decline in the likelihood of a \uc2 Trump\uc2  presidency led to a modest stock rally, then a larger decline in Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's electoral fortunes would most likely lead to a larger market reaction. A surprise win for Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  would probably set off a substantial market correction.\par \par \uc2 We can be a bit more precise. According to political prediction markets, the odds of a \uc2 Trump\uc2  presidency fell by nearly six percentage points during the debate. By contrast, the difference between a certain \uc2 Trump\uc2  loss and a certain \uc2 Trump\uc2  win -- by definition, a 100-percentage-point change in probability -- is around 16 times as large as that six-percentage-point drop. It follows that the difference in the value of stocks under a President \uc2 Clinton\uc2  versus a President \uc2 Trump\uc2  is 16 times as large as Monday night's stock market shift.\par \par \uc2 Putting the pieces together (multiplying that 16 by the percentage point rise in the S.&P. 500 value), this suggests that the market expects stock prices to be 10 to 12 percent lower if Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  wins than they will be if he loses.\par \par \uc2 This is a big difference.\par \par \uc2 What does it all mean? When economists conduct ''event studies'' like this, they typically do so in the hope that movements in stock prices reflect the informed bets of traders trying to assess the future profitability of the businesses they're buying or selling. If that's right, then Wall Street is telling us that if Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  is elected, it expects the profitability of America's largest businesses to be about 10 to 12 percent lower on average in the future.\par \par \uc2 This is all the more remarkable because it occurs despite Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's having promised an enormous profit-raising corporate tax cut. Either the markets don't believe he'll deliver on these tax cuts, or they believe that the rest of his economic program will do enough harm to more than offset the benefits of lower taxes.\par \par \uc2 Unfortunately, an event study is silent as to what's behind Wall Street's fears. This sort of adverse market reaction might reflect concerns about Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's unconventional approach to the \uc2 Federal Reserve\uc2 , worries about a possible trade war, fiscal irresponsibility, apprehension about national security or simply the cost of greater uncertainty.\par \par \uc2 Assessing what this means for the broader economy requires a bit of guesswork. It all depends on the extent to which Wall Street's worries are also worries for Main Street.\par \par \uc2 If the \uc2 Trump\uc2  stock discount reflects expectations of lower earnings and if the rest of the economy performs like publicly traded companies, the math suggests that overall national income would fall substantially, perhaps by as much as 10 to 12 percent over coming decades. If only big publicly traded companies were to suffer, the decline would be less; if the rest of the economy were more vulnerable, there would be a greater decline.\par \par \uc2 Some of the market's aversion to Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  probably reflects the assessment that the world would simply be riskier under him. Traders are so unsure of what the future would hold that they're reluctant to invest in stocks without a huge discount.\par \par \uc2 We can put this in historical perspective. In research with the economists Erik Snowberg of the \uc2 University of British Columbia\uc2  and \uc2 Eric Zitzewitz\uc2  of \uc2 Dartmouth College\uc2 , I've studied how the stock market responded in the days surrounding each presidential \uc2 election\uc2  back to 1880.\par \par \uc2 Typically, we found that no candidate moved the market by more than a couple of percentage points. Moreover, it was somewhat more common for the stock market to rise slightly on the \uc2 election\uc2  of a Republican than of a Democrat.\par \par \uc2 The 2016 pattern is an exception. The market prefers the Democrat and believes that Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  is a unique threat to prosperity. It appears to assess the consequences of a \uc2 Trump\uc2  victory as a bit worse than 9/11, and roughly comparable to the onset of the Iraq War.\par \par \uc2 The Upshot provides news, analysis and graphics about politics, policy and everyday life.

HYLTON \par \uc2 8,247 \uc2 words\par \uc2 2 October 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 43\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 A little before 7 the other night, the prosecutor Marilyn Mosby stopped by my house in Baltimore for dinner. She was coming straight from work in one of her customary gray pantsuits, and because I was already nursing a beer, she took off her jacket with a sigh and poured herself a glass of white wine. Then we stepped onto the back deck to throw a few burgers on the grill. This being a September evening, you might imagine the yard in raking light and breezy autumnal aspect, but it was actually pretty swampy, the oppressive tonnage of summer humidity not yet given way to season's end, so as soon as the burgers looked about done, we ferried them inside and settled at the island in my kitchen to eat. After a few minutes, Mosby's husband, Nick, who sits on the City Council, knocked on my front door, let himself in and wandered through the house to join us. He took a seat two chairs down from Marilyn, leaving an empty one between them.\par \par \uc2 ''Hey, Marilyn,'' he said quietly.\par \par \uc2 ''Hey, Nick,'' she said. ''How are you?''\par \par \uc2 ''Fine,'' he said.\par \par \uc2 ''How was your meeting?''\par \par \uc2 ''What meeting?''\par \par \uc2 ''Didn't you have a Council meeting?''\par \par \uc2 ''Oh,'' he said. ''That was a long time ago.''\par \par \uc2 She raised an eyebrow. ''Then where are you coming from just now?''\par \par \uc2 ''I was waiting for you at home,'' he said.\par \par \uc2 Now she looked annoyed. ''I called you at 6:07,'' she said. ''You didn't answer.''\par \par \uc2 ''Which number?'' he asked.\par \par \uc2 ''Your cellphone!'' she said.\par \par \uc2 There was a long silence as Marilyn stared at Nick, who stared at the table. ''Well,'' he said, shaking his head. ''I was at home.''\par \par \uc2 I relate this bit of conversation not because it offers a perfect window on the Mosbys and their marriage, but just the opposite: because it's important to understand from the outset that what you are about to read is a narrow but intimate view. A couple in the midst of a public ordeal is not excused from life's usual bothers, and what is striking when you find yourself in proximity to a crisis isn't always the soaring arc of the fall but the way it touches against, grazes and refracts all the familiar daily torments on the way down.\par \par \uc2 In case your memory is a little foggy, the Mosbys have emerged as one of the most prominent political couples in Baltimore over the last 18 months of upheaval. Nick represents the City Council district where a 25-year-old resident, Freddie Gray, was arrested in April 2015 and where protests over his death turned to incendiary violence. Marilyn is the state's attorney who, in the midst of that unrest, took to the steps of the War Memorial downtown, facing City Hall, to announce that she was filing criminal charges against six police officers over Gray's death.\par \par \uc2 ''I have heard your calls for 'no justice, no peace!' '' she boomed before a bank of television cameras in a clip that would echo across the country, would calm the simmering tenor of the city and would, at least temporarily, elevate Mosby to the role of proxy for a nation reeling with outrage and disbelief over the failure of other prosecutors in other cities to indict other police officers for the killings of other black men, including Michael Brown in Ferguson, Mo., and Eric Garner on Staten Island. In the days after her announcement, Mosby would be thrust into a woozy limelight: called onstage at a Prince benefit concert and photographed by \uc2 Annie Leibovitz\uc2  for \uc2 Vogue\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Yet over the last year and a half, the halo around Mosby has faded as her office failed to convict any of the police officers and instead produced three acquittals, and one hung jury -- before deciding in late July to withdraw all remaining charges. She is now being sued for defamation by five of the officers she indicted and has become a go-to grievance for the voluble right, being subject to more or less constant assault on the conservative airwaves, accused of criminal misconduct by \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  and featured on the cover of the police magazine Frontline under the headline ''The Wolf That Lurks.'' A steady barrage of racist hate mail and death threats still pours into her home and office. Nick Mosby has had an equally dispiriting year, having started and abandoned a campaign for mayor of Baltimore and, in the process, giving up his seat on the Council, where his term comes to an end this year. Critics often accuse the Mosbys of Clintonian ambition. A few weeks ago, Baltimore's alternative weekly, City Paper, released its annual Best of Baltimore issue, declaring them ''Best Failed Political Dynasty'' and naming Marilyn ''Best Don Quixote.''\par \par \uc2 Missing in all the hype and fizzle has been just about any public comment from the Mosbys, and particularly from Marilyn, who spent nine months under a gag order imposed by the criminal courts. At her news conference in July to announce the dismissal of charges, she seemed to offer a glimpse into her mood and thinking when she denounced the city's criminal-\u173\'00\'ADjustice system as hopelessly broken. ''Without real, substantive reforms,'' she said, ''we could try this case 100 times, and cases just like it, and still wind up with the same result.'' Afterward, Mosby declined to take questions, and she has mostly avoided interviews since, citing the defamation lawsuits against her.\par \par \uc2 Baltimore is a peculiar place, with its own categories of privilege. The northern sector is an enclave of white wealth that would be familiar to any New Englander, with historic stone churches and elite preparatory schools cultivating vaunted lacrosse programs, but the city is predominantly black, with mostly black political leaders, and if you're a kid like me, who came up through the public schools downtown and spent several years writing news and opinion pieces for a prominent black paper, you can gain a certain alternate privilege and entree with the city's other power base, which we might call the black establishment. It is possible to find yourself, as I did one night this spring, sitting alone with the mayor in the back of a bar to chat over a few drinks, or leaving for vacation this month with a longtime member of the City Council. So when a curious figure like Mosby emerges, even if she's bound to silence, you're only a phone call away from a personal introduction.\par \par \uc2 Which is how it came to be that one day in August, I asked a friend to put us in touch and discovered that Mosby was not only willing but eager to record a series of conversations. A couple of days before she and Nick dropped by for dinner, we traveled to Dorchester, Mass., to visit the old Victorian home where Mosby's grandmother lives, chatting around her dining table among piles of family knickknacks and photo albums, and a few days before that, we scarfed down pizza at the Mosbys' rowhouse in Baltimore, six blocks up the street from my parents, while their two young daughters, Nylyn and Aniyah, scampered around laughing and the family cat clawed at the leather chairs, with Marilyn pausing occasionally to shriek: ''Get Down! GET DOWN!''\par \par \uc2 The upshot being that after a while, these get-\u173\'00\'ADtogethers began to seem less like individual interviews than phases in a much longer conversation that was already well underway. As I listen to the recordings now, what jumps out is how fluid the discussion became, how quickly it would pivot from the most quotidian affairs, like a choice of condiment or a spat over a missed phone call, to a deeper slate of personal concerns that cut to the center of their lives, as the Mosbys tried to convey in whatever words they could muster the experience of these last few months, of what went wrong, and when and why, and how much they had lost. ''I don't think I'll ever be who I was before,'' Marilyn told me at one point. ''I'm still trying to figure out who this new woman is.''\par \par \uc2 Throughout all this, I was also recording conversations with a variety of other people in Baltimore, some fiercely opposed to the Mosbys, others ardent fans. At a certain point in the middle of September, after maybe three weeks of hosting gatherings, it began to feel as if my living room had become an old-\u173\'00\'ADfashioned salon, in which the story of the Baltimore uprising was being endlessly retold in Rashomon variation.\par \par \uc2 Like one night in mid-\u173\'00\'ADSeptember, a cop with two decades of service on the police force swung by around 9 p.m. and spent the next hour and a half venting about Mosby's intractable incompetence. In case you are picturing some old white dude with a revanchist hankering for the good old days of zero tolerance, I want you to know that this cop is a woman of color with staunchly liberal views, who firmly supports mandatory police cameras and readily acknowledges, for example, that under the mayoralty of \uc2 Martin O'Malley\uc2  in the early 2000s, the Baltimore police behaved like a goon squad, rounding up black people in mass arrests without a scintilla of probable cause. ''O'Malley had us clearing corners and violating the constitutional rights of everybody,'' she said.\par \par \uc2 Even so, she regarded Mosby as a singular catastrophe for the city. One thing that most people outside Baltimore don't realize is the degree to which Mosby's \uc2 election\uc2  in 2014 came as a surprise. When she started her campaign to become the city's top prosecutor a year before, she was a 33-year-old corporate lawyer working for an insurance firm. Although she had spent a few years in the prosecutor's office from 2005 to 2011, she caught little notice on the job. ''I was like, 'Who is that?' '' the officer at my house recalled thinking when Mosby announced her campaign. ''And I knew pretty much every state's attorney at the district level, and every state's attorney at the Circuit Court level, and most of the judges.'' In conversation with half a dozen prosecutors who worked with Mosby, no one could remember any of the cases she handled before her \uc2 election\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 People have all different ways of explaining Mosby's victory, but most agree that it came down to a combination of the political connections that she and Nick developed through his seat on the City Council; a vigorous yearlong campaign of knocking on doors across the city; the failure of the incumbent state's attorney, \uc2 Gregg Bernstein\uc2 , to take her seriously until the final weeks of their race; and the underlying electoral math of a hyper\u173\'00\'ADsegregated city.\par \par \uc2 The night before the Mosbys came over for dinner, I invited a city councilman named Carl Stokes for drinks. Stokes is an old friend of mine, for whatever that disclosure is worth, and is a 66-year-old black man who has been involved in local politics since approximately forever. Over the 20 years I've known him, I would say he has become increasingly allergic to euphemism. During the uprising last year, for example, he caused a stir on \uc2 CNN\uc2  when he denounced the anchor for using the term ''thug'' with a flurry of unvarnished indignation that I can tell you is precisely what I love about Carl. Stokes admires Mosby, but over dinner he laid out a pretty simple theory to explain city elections. ''It's black and white,'' he said with a laugh. ''This is Baltimore! The only time the issues matter is when two candidates of the same race are competing.'' Anyone from Baltimore can think of contrary examples to what Stokes was saying, but anyone honest would have to admit that the basic gist is right.\par \par \uc2 A couple of days later, I went for a run through the city with a reporter who has covered Baltimore for many years. Zigzagging through a dozen neighborhoods along sidewalks and watershed ravines, he sketched an alternate history of how the last two years might have unfolded if Mosby had somehow lost the \uc2 election\uc2 , giving another prosecutor custody of the Gray case, which might have led to a different outcome in the trials while also giving Nick Mosby enough distance from the controversy to be elected mayor -- a prospect appealing to my friend, who considered Nick a rising star. At the end of this long, wistful analysis, he threw his hands in the air and said, ''We got the wrong Mosby.''\par \par \uc2 Other Baltimore reporters might tell you just the opposite. Another friend, who covers the city for a major newspaper, has told me on more than one occasion that whatever you think about the way Mosby handled the trials, you have to admire the guts she showed in taking on the Police Department, knowing that it would alienate many of the prosecutors in her office and every cop in the city. ''Even if you don't think she did the best job prosecuting the cases, I have a lot of respect for her,'' my friend said. He was less enthusiastic about Nick: ''I think his decision to run for mayor hurt her. Their political aspirations collided, but she's a much more compelling figure than he is.''\par \par \uc2 Marilyn Mosby took office as Baltimore's top prosecutor in January 2015, a few days before her 35th birthday. She arrived for her first day on the job with a clear focus on reform. Mosby believes that the country is in the midst of a paradigm shift in criminal justice, in which city prosecutors are learning to redirect energy from the drug war toward violent crime. ''When it comes to violent offenders, I'm going to go hard, and I'll sit in the courtroom and make sure that the jury sees me and that you get the maximum sentence,'' she told me. ''But at the same time, when we're talking about nonviolent offenses, drug offenses, I think that that's when you can exercise discretion.''\par \par \uc2 In the weeks before Mosby assumed office, she watched grand juries for Ferguson and Staten Island fail to indict police officers in high-\u173\'00\'ADprofile killings of black men, and she spent the period leading up to her inauguration traveling to other cities and meeting with other top prosecutors to learn how they organized their staffs to reflect the changing landscape around the drug war and police brutality. She made a point of asking each prosecutor she met how his or her office handled the investigation of police misconduct. ''That was one of the questions that I would ask every person,'' she said. ''I went to Atlanta, I met with Kamala Harris in L.A., I went to Philadelphia, I went to Manhattan, I went to Washington, D.C.''\par \par \uc2 In her first week on the job, she fired six prosecutors, setting off a round of hand-\u173\'00\'ADwringing in the local media; since then, she has presided over a continuous outflow, with more than 60 prosecutors leaving over the last 21 months, which by my estimation is about five times the usual attrition. Mosby said that this is partly a consequence of reform. ''Of course the amount of turnover is going to be higher than my predecessor,'' she said. ''Because I've challenged the status quo, and people are going to have a problem with that.''\par \par \uc2 Whether you agree that losing nearly a third of her staff is a sign of a vigorous shake-up in a calcifying agency or believe instead that it's a tragic evisceration of a vital public office depends on your own inclinations. Suffice it to say that from the perspective of a cop, the replacement of so many veteran prosecutors with new attorneys has been frustrating. ''They have seriously depleted the top end,'' a police lieutenant with three decades of experience told me, ''and the result is that nobody knows what they're doing.'' Add to that the festering resentment over Mosby's decision to prosecute officers for the death of Gray, and it's fair to say that the partnership between the police and prosecutors in Baltimore is broken.\par \par \uc2 ''It's a fractured relationship,'' the cop at my house the other night said with a shrug. ''It's absolutely been fractured, and I won't say it can't be repaired, but I think it's going to be a very, very long time.'' As she was preparing to leave, I asked this officer if she was willing to admit that the conflict with Mosby, and the mutual mistrust, has led police officers to pull back from their essential duties. One of the most discouraging statistics in Baltimore has been a 63 percent increase in homicides last year. As I asked about this, I watched the cop's face twist into a frown, which at first I mistook for a sign that she was offended by the question. Then she nodded.\par \par \uc2 ''Absolutely,'' she said. ''You should get used to 300 murders a year.''\par \par \uc2 Mosby's childhood home in Dorchester is a gray, prefabricated duplex surrounded by a thin strip of weedy grass. In a neighborhood of large historic homes with broad eaves and wraparound porches, it stands out for being almost perfectly devoid of architectural interest. What the home lacks in grace, however, it recovers in proximity: It is just around the corner from the sprawling manse where Mosby's grandparents lived.\par \par \uc2 As I stood with Mosby outside her former home on Labor Day weekend, I was struck by how different she appeared from her professional persona. It wasn't just that she had swapped out her workaday suits for a faded purple T-shirt and jean shorts with Converse high-tops. There was also an unguarded ease about her that suggested a person in every way content to be home. When I arrived, she was settled in front of the television with her grandmother while Nick relaxed upstairs. Now, as she stood on the sidewalk around the corner, she seemed to brace herself for the inevitable rush of memory; we were on the spot where, as a young teenager, she watched her cousin die.\par \par \uc2 Mosby and I had spoken about Diron Spence before. Growing up on either side of their duplex, just three years apart in age, with the shared experience of attending mostly white schools through Boston's Metco desegregation program, Mosby and her cousin became extraordinarily close. ''He was like my brother,'' she said.\par \par \uc2 Spence was killed on an uncommonly hot afternoon in August 1994. Mosby, who was 14, was in her bedroom when she heard the crack of gunfire. ''Then I hear the doorbell going crazy, so I ran downstairs,'' she recalled. As she opened the door, she found a friend in a panic, saying, ''I think somebody just shot Diron.'' Mosby could see a figure running down the street. She shut the door, then opened it again. Diron's body was crumpled on the sidewalk. ''I seen him laying on the corner,'' she said. ''Just laying there.''\par \par \uc2 Standing on the site two decades later, Mosby was still visibly shaken. The neighborhood contained plenty of troubled kids, but Diron wasn't one. He was an honor student on his way to college. Investigators would eventually conclude that the killing was a botched robbery and a matter of mistaken identity. ''Everything is still a blur,'' she said. ''I try to suppress a lot of that stuff. I just remember seeing him laying in the street.''\par \par \uc2 We walked to the front of her grandparents' house and stepped inside. There was a billiards table in the middle of the front room and beyond it a pair of French doors leading to a large indoor pool. ''This was the hangout spot,'' she said. ''We used to have barbecues, and then my grandmother had karaoke night until like 4 in the morning every weekend.''\par \par \uc2 The crowd that gathered around Mosby's family in those days consisted mainly of cops. Mosby comes from a police family in a way that few Americans can understand. Her grandfather was a founding member of the first black police officers' association in Massachusetts and made the home both a gathering place for cops and a refuge for troubled kids. Although Mosby's mother and uncle shared the duplex around the corner, Mosby spent much of her childhood with her grandparents. Her mother gave birth at 17 and struggled with substance abuse, often leaving Mosby in the care of her grandmother, Marilyn Thompson.\par \par \uc2 We found Thompson in the kitchen, watching television. She is a sturdy woman with short gray hair, a shy smile and amused eyes. She told me a story about Mosby's childhood as the only black student at her elementary school in the wealthy town of Dover. ''This one other girl was Asian,'' she recalled with a smile, ''so Marilyn told the little girl, 'You and I have to stick together, because we're minorities.' '' Mosby laughed, but she had told me less anodyne stories of white children telling her they didn't want to be friends with a black girl or approaching her in the hallways, wagging their fingers and trotting out lines like, ''You go, girl.''\par \par \uc2 ''I had to be representative of all black kids,'' she said. ''So at a very early age, you have to put it in perspective. I said: 'I don't speak like that. Why are you talking to me like that? You're talking to me like that because I'm black, and you have this perception about black people.' ''\par \par \uc2 As a teenager, Mosby plunged into political action. She became active in the student government and the school newspaper; she worked with a group called Weatoc, which raised awareness about issues of race and gender; she joined an organization known as Project Hip-Hop, which fosters appreciation of the civil rights movement -- she walked the bridge in Selma, Ala., and visited the grave of James Chaney in Meridian, Miss. In 1998, she enrolled at the historically black Tuskegee University, where she met Nick. Their first evening together, they stayed up until all hours dissecting politics. He was determined to return to Baltimore and enter local politics.\par \par \uc2 I asked Mosby if, during these years, she also began to see another side of the police; if like so many black Americans, she found herself stopped and questioned without cause. ''I can't tell you how many times that's happened to me and my husband,'' she said. ''But at the end of the day, what are we doing about it? Back in the day, they strategized, they organized. It wasn't just marching and protesting. And it's so frustrating to me. Do you know how much of a difference you can make by being at the table? For example, the whole Black Lives Matter -- like, start enrolling in these police departments! I'm trying to reform the system from within. Ninety-\u173\'00\'ADfive percent of the elected prosecutors in this country are white. Seventy-\u173\'00\'ADnine percent are white men. As a woman of color, I represent 1 percent of all elected prosecutors in the country.''\par \par \uc2 As she spoke, it occurred to me that from a certain vantage, Mosby seemed almost perfectly groomed for the moment in which she burst into national attention. If you were trying to engineer a figure with the right background and life experience, the instinct and inclination to do what prosecutors for Ferguson and Staten Island did not, you would imagine a young black prosecutor, acutely aware of racial injustice and systemic oppression, who had organized herself since childhood to confront bigotry through political action, and yet someone who came from generations of police, who could not be accused of hating cops or coddling criminals, whose commitment to hard-\u173\'00\'ADnosed prosecution was inspired by her own formative experience of violent crime.\par \par \uc2 Mosby and I left her grandmother in the kitchen and settled to chat in the dim light of the dining room. She seemed almost to exhale the accumulated strain of the last year and a half as she began to describe in detail the moment when she lost faith in the police investigation of Gray's death, when she realized that she didn't trust the internal review to uncover the truth and felt compelled to turn the glaring light of the prosecutor's office onto the family of blue that she'd known all her life.\par \par \uc2 ''The Police Department from the very outset seemed to be going down a different route,'' Mosby said. ''They were under the impression that Freddie Gray did this to himself.''\par \par \uc2 It was April 13, 2015, when Mosby first spoke with Baltimore police officers about Gray's injuries. He had been arrested a day earlier, at the corner of Mount and Presbury Streets in a tough West Baltimore neighborhood known as Sandtown-\u173\'00\'ADWinchester. Two of his neighbors used cellphones to record the scene as a pair of police officers on bicycles held him down, then dragged him to a van with his legs dangling beneath him. Gray could be heard on the video screaming in apparent pain. By the end of the day, he lay in the hospital, in a coma, with three fractured vertebrae, a crushed larynx and his spinal cord nearly severed, while the videos of his arrest began to circulate on social media.\par \par \uc2 Mosby is an avid \uc2 Twitter\uc2  user and saw a video that night. As she gathered with her staff the next morning for their daily meeting, she prepared a list of questions about what happened to Gray. This is routine for any situation in which prosecutors suspect that a crime might have taken place; part of their job is to coordinate with the police to draw out evidence necessary to consider charges. But when Mosby and her staff met with police officials the next day, she said, her internal alarms started going off. She believed that the police investigators were not seriously considering the possibility of wrongdoing by other cops. ''It was this perception that he had done this to himself, and it didn't add up,'' she said. ''They didn't want to do anything that we requested them to do, and we saw that right away.''\par \par \uc2 Mosby decided to look into the case independently: ''It just did not make any sense, and so I said: 'Send our investigators out to the scene. We need to figure out what's going on.' '' She told me that some prosecutors in her office were reluctant to question the police narrative so quickly. ''My team was like, 'Well, we've got to be real careful, because we need the police,' '' she said. ''I told them: 'We need the police to a certain extent, but we need to find out the truth. So I need you to go send investigators out there and find out what the hell happened.' ''\par \par \uc2 One element that raised Mosby's suspicion was the statement of a witness, Donta Allen, who was picked up by the police shortly after Gray and was held in the opposite side of the transport van. Although there was a metal partition separating the two men, the police told Mosby that Allen heard Gray intentionally smashing his head against the dividing wall. ''Donta Allen, to me, was not a credible witness,'' Mosby told me. ''This is an individual that says, 'I know the guy on the other side was banging his head!' How do you know that? There's a wall. You don't know what's banging. And it's the same thing that the police officers are trying to say. Meanwhile, Allen hasn't been charged with anything, and he's essentially being let go. I need to know who this Donta Allen is. So I had my prosecutors go down to the police station to try to pull the records to see if he's a confidential informant. My suspicion was that he was.''\par \par \uc2 Investigators for the state's attorney do not have police powers. They can knock on doors, interview witnesses and request public documents, but in order to file a search warrant, they need police support. Mosby said that on a series of requests, she could not get the Baltimore police to comply. ''We couldn't trust that they were going to follow through with everything that we needed,'' she said. One of her requests was to execute a search warrant on the personal cellphones of the officers involved. Mosby told me that she knew the officers exchanged several text messages while Gray was in the van, and she believed that the content of those messages would be important to determine what happened.\par \par \uc2 ''We got a judge to sign off on the search warrant,'' she said, ''and a police investigator failed to do it. She didn't execute it, and then returned it and didn't tell us. It was just incredibly, incredibly frustrating. It was at this point where I was just like, 'You all, we cannot rely on them, so we have to do something other than working with them.' '' The lead investigator for the police, Dawnyell Taylor, told me that the cellphones were actually a ''nonfactor'' because another officer turned over a personal cellphone to the grand jury that contained innocuous messages with some of the cops involved. ''You got to see it all,'' Taylor said. ''It wasn't going to give us jack.'' (A police spokesman defended the investigation, saying detectives worked with the ''utmost integrity.'')\par \par \uc2 Mosby said she turned to the state police for help. ''We went to them with a number of items in which we said, 'Can you please follow up on this, this and this?' And they said, 'No, we'll only help you with I.T. support.' ''\par \par \uc2 Meanwhile, if you lived in Baltimore, you could feel the temperature of the street rising. On April 19, one week after Gray's arrest, the police announced that he had died. Outrage in the city began to swell, and protests filled downtown. On Saturday, April 25, demonstrators clashed with overzealous officers in riot gear outside the baseball stadium, and on April 27, officials responded to a false report of incipient violence by shutting down lines of transportation near a local mall, which only fanned the outrage further: Fights broke out, cars and buildings were torched and 130 police officers suffered injuries.\par \par \uc2 Mosby said that throughout all this, she watched the mayor, Stephanie Rawlings-\u173\'00\'ADBlake, and the police commissioner, Anthony Batts, deliver misinformation to reporters. For example, Batts was undercounting the number of stops the police van made before delivering Gray to medical attention. ''First Batts said there were three stops, and we knew at that point there were four or five,'' she said. ''So I sat down with them and said: 'You know, we've got to stop putting misinformation out into the media and giving that to the public. It's going to be to our detriment.' They didn't listen.''\par \par \uc2 Mosby also believed that the Police Department was in a rush to close the case. She said that Batts ''came up with this fictitious timeline as to when the investigation would be complete, on May 1. So I'm like: 'Where are you getting this? The autopsy report isn't even usually completed that quickly.' Then the mayor started telling the media, 'Oh, absolutely we know that this death took place inside of the wagon.' Wait a minute. The investigation is not even complete. How are you going out to the public and saying you know for certain that this took place inside of the wagon?''\par \par \uc2 In private, Batts and Rawlings-\u173\'00\'ADBlake are equally critical of Mosby -- and sometimes each other. Rawlings-\u173\'00\'ADBlake fired Batts as commissioner in July 2015. When I contacted the mayor about Mosby's comments, she chose not to respond on the record, but Batts vehemently denied putting out misinformation. He said he thought it was important to report progress in the investigation as it happened, even if some details were likely to prove wrong. ''Cases change as you get more information,'' he said. ''But you've got to tell people something, and you've got to tell them as much as you can to be transparent.'' He said that although the preliminary police investigation was ending, he expected Mosby's investigation to continue beyond May 1.\par \par \uc2 In Dorchester, Mosby leaned back in her chair and sighed. After 18 months, the memory of her conflict with Batts and Rawlings-\u173\'00\'ADBlake was still frustrating. While they argued over how much information to release and whether it was accurate, the streets of Baltimore were breaking down. ''There are protesters outside; they are burning stuff down,'' she said. ''I had told them that was going to happen, because they were exacerbating distrust. So I called the mayor, and I was livid. I was like: 'You know, this is ridiculous. You all have single-\u173\'00\'ADhandedly caused what's happening in this city right now.' I just screamed on her. But she was like: 'Oh, no, I'm getting phone calls from the attorney general and the president's office. They want to know -- where's the state's attorney?' I said: 'That's because you and your commissioner have set false expectations. You did this, not me. Not me.' And I was like, 'You know what else?' I can't remember what I said, but I hung up on her. And that was it.''\par \par \uc2 Just then, Nick wandered down the staircase in an old Orioles T-shirt.\par \par \uc2 ''Nick,'' Marilyn said. ''Do you remember my conversation with the mayor?''\par \par \uc2 ''When you asked them to stop having the press conferences?'' he asked.\par \par \uc2 ''No, not that one. She said the A.G. had called. They wanted to know where the state's attorney was and why I hadn't done anything.''\par \par \uc2 Nick shot a worried glance at my tape recorder. ''Yeah, I don't remember,'' he said.\par \par \uc2 A silence descended in the room, and after a while Nick continued to the kitchen. Marilyn and I spoke for a few minutes longer, then she walked me to the door. We stood on the porch in darkness, and I asked if she felt any regret about the impact of her public profile on her private life.\par \par \uc2 ''I don't know,'' she said quietly. ''It's definitely a sacrifice. This has been the most trying time in our relationship, and I've been with Nick since I was 18 years old. It's a lot of stress, and I take it out on him, unfortunately.''\par \par \uc2 ''At least you're aware of that,'' I said.\par \par \uc2 ''I am now,'' she said with a laugh. ''I mean, in retrospect, you can say, 'O.K., I was projecting whatever I was going through onto you.' But when you're going through it, you don't necessarily understand it.''\par \par \uc2 Mosby swallowed hard and looked away, and I walked down the street to my car. As I pulled away, she was still standing alone on the porch in darkness.\par \par \uc2 A favorite parlor game in Baltimore these days, best undertaken with bourbon, is to enumerate the various errors and blunders in the Freddie Gray trials. The most common mistake you hear attributed to Mosby is that she overcharged in the indictments, trying to establish such a profound degree of blame that it was impossible to prove. This is an accusation you hear everywhere around town, but it strikes me as the least compelling, because it overlooks the reality that prosecutors often overcharge as a matter of process, and that it's standard procedure in a criminal case to begin with the most extreme indictment that can be squeezed under the rubric of probable cause. As the case proceeds and the standard of proof rises, the arc of a case is often a matter of prosecutors tailoring those early claims down.\par \par \uc2 To my mind, the more troubling aspect of the trials is the litany of small, strange choices that aggregated until you had to wonder what prosecutors were thinking. For example, in Maryland, a criminal defendant has the right to decide whether he wants to face a judge or a jury. When a police officer is charged with a criminal offense, she enjoys the same basic rights. Pretty much anyone in Baltimore can tell you that a cop will get more sympathy from the average judge than the average jury, so it was no surprise when most of the officers asked for a bench trial. Except that it did appear to bother Mosby, who has insisted that the officers shouldn't be allowed to make that choice. Mosby told me she believes that the right to a trial by jury is so basic to the American system that the defense and the prosecution should have to agree before it can be waived. That's how the system works in federal court and some other states. If the Freddie Gray case had taken place in Atlanta, for example, a prosecutor could have forced the police officers to face a jury. As it happened, the trials took place in Baltimore.\par \par \uc2 The other glaring example like this involved Gray's pocketknife. Police claimed that the knife was illegal and used it to justify his arrest. Mosby and her staff have argued that the arrest was illegal, because police didn't know that Gray was carrying a knife when they took him into custody. The problem with this position is that it fails to account for the murky space between a stop and an arrest. Cops have a great deal of latitude -- one might say too much -- to detain a suspect, and if they find an illegal weapon during a search, they can escalate to an arrest. These are pretty rudimentary things, which is why it's bewildering that Mosby's team chose to make them an issue in the case. Taylor, the lead investigator for the police, said of Mosby, ''Maybe if she spent some time in the courtroom, she would know how this whole process worked.''\par \par \uc2 On the other hand, the level of intransigence that Mosby says she encountered from the Police Department is troubling. Especially if the officers planted an informant in the van to suggest that Gray injured himself, as Mosby suspected, and if investigators failed to execute a search warrant for the text messages. Allen, by the way, has retracted his original statements about Gray banging his head, and he denies being an informant. Mosby so distrusted the process, from top to bottom, that she did not inform the mayor of her decision to press charges until a few minutes before she announced it to the world. ''I called her five minutes before, and I said, 'I'm giving you a heads-up,' '' she said.\par \par \uc2 What has emerged, then, is a pair of irreconcilable narratives about the death of Gray -- but a trial, by nature, tends to emphasize one. The prosecution crafts a detailed story about what may have happened, leaving the defense to respond in \u173\'00\'ADpieces along the way. But there is another complex narrative for the defense, another timeline to explain Gray's death, which is endorsed by just about every cop in the city and many of the prosecutors who have left Mosby's office. I find that narrative underwhelming for several reasons, one of which is that I believe the medical examiner's conclusion that Gray's injuries suggest homicide. It's nevertheless useful to consider the alternate story, so I'll try to present it as nearly as I can.\par \par \uc2 Imagine the scene for a moment. Here is Freddie Gray. He's standing on the corner in a pair of bluejeans and a light jacket over a black Lacoste T-shirt. Let's say he's holding a few pills of dope, or let's just say he's selling them, when a pair of cops roll up on bicycles and Gray takes off.\par \par \uc2 Probably at this point the cops should let him go, because really, who cares? Veteran officers know that the city is awash in violent crime and that mucking around with Gray over a dope collar amounts to nothing. But these are cops on an enforcement detail, under pressure to make arrests, so we have a pursuit, and pretty soon, they have Gray down. But when they search his pockets, they can't find the pills. No surprise. Any suspect on the run is going to consider tossing his dope or swallowing it, and it seems as if Gray ate his. His toxicology report will eventually come back with traces of opioids in his blood, and even the cops will admit that Gray wasn't a junkie or a user. In fact, some of them will tell you that he worked with them as an informant and that they wish the flex squad had left him alone. ''When I catch somebody and I can't find the drugs, I'm like: 'All right. You win today. I'll get you tomorrow,' '' a cop who worked with Gray told me. ''But those young guys, those bike cops, honestly they're kind of looking for numbers.'''\par \par \uc2 So now the police call for a wagon, and when it comes, they hoist Gray in. At this point, he's crying out in pain and clearly dragging his legs. Any normal citizen watching the video is going to say the only humane thing to do is call for medical help, but plenty of cops see it differently. They'll tell you that people fake injuries all the time, and not only fake them but deliberately incur them to avoid jail. ''I've seen it hundreds of times, guys banging their head on the cellblock wall or the door or just thrashing around to injure themselves,'' one cop told me. In any case, Gray goes into the van with handcuffs and shackles, but no one puts his seatbelt on. That may seem negligent, but cops say it was completely normal; that if you get close enough to strap someone in, there's a chance he'll strike out. ''Their knees are literally touching the center wall, so you would have to crawl across their waist to buckle them in,'' a longtime officer told me. ''So if he's sitting on the right side of the van, you're going to have to lean over him with your gun side basically sticking in his stomach, and you're at his mercy. Even though he's handcuffed, he can bite you, he can knee you, he can head-butt you.'' The cop with three decades of experience told me, ''I never saw one single guy seat\u173\'00\'ADbelted, ever, before Freddie Gray.''\par \par \uc2 So the van takes off with Gray shackled and possibly injured, loose in the back without a seatbelt. Next you have the ''rough ride.'' There's been a lot of talk about this: cops driving fast around corners and making sudden stops with suspects in the van. Nobody on the police force will say this never happened. It's a point of fact in Baltimore, especially in decades past, and any good cop will tell you that giving somebody a rough ride should be grounds for disciplinary action. But a lot of cops don't believe that it happened to Gray. Think about the dynamic, they say. These are a couple of cops on bicycles calling for a wagon. The driver doesn't care about them. ''They're just here to pick up your guy, search him, take him to central booking, drop him off,'' one cop said. ''There's no camaraderie, like, 'Oh, we're going to get him for you.' That's not going to happen.''\par \par \uc2 Maybe the van driver has his own agenda, or maybe Gray is simply in the back of a wagon bouncing through the cratered streets of West Baltimore. Either way, by the time he comes out, he's in critical condition. We know from the autopsy that the way he was dragging his legs wasn't substantiated by any known injury. Cops will tell you that after faking a medical calamity, Gray gave himself a real one inside the wagon.\par \par \uc2 And that's your basic police narrative. Call it the case for the defense. If you find it convoluted and improbable compared with the simple explanation that the police roughed him up and bounced him around until he died, then the question becomes, If the prosecution's story is so obvious, why was it so hard to convict? One member of the hung jury told me that, although she is a black woman from the city who appreciates the problem of police brutality, ''11 out of 12 of us felt like the prosecution should have done a better job, and some of us are individuals who were for conviction.''\par \par \uc2 Mosby likes to say that even without convictions, the trials have done more good than she could have hoped. The Police Department has installed cameras inside vans and adopted new requirements for the use of force and the provision of medical care. Two weeks after Mosby dropped the remaining charges, the Justice Department released a blistering review of the discriminatory practices of the Baltimore police; under federal scrutiny, the department is likely to implement a raft of reforms. But the most important impact of the trials may be in the way future investigations of the police unfold. This month, Mosby plans to introduce, with a consortium of other prosecutors from around the country, a set of five recommendations that would give prosecutors more independence and authority to investigate the police.\par \par \uc2 Still, in the case of Freddie Gray, the uncomfortable truth remains that if, like Mosby, you believe that a man was killed by police negligence, you must also accept that the officers accused of killing him went free. The question that lingers around Mosby, then, is really one of shading: whether the failure to convict was a result of her own mistakes or of the larger forces arrayed against her. Whether, that is, the fatal error was personal or systemic, whether it was pride or destiny that stopped her, whether the tragedy is Shakespearean or Greek.\par \par \uc2 Over dinner at my place, conversation with the Mosbys drifted between this and that, before turning to their political aspirations, once shared, now driven apart. Since the day they met at Tuskegee, they worked together for every ambition, helping to manage each other's campaigns and careers. But within weeks of Marilyn's inauguration, news reports began to imply that Nick was pulling the strings in her office. To blunt the accusation, Marilyn felt compelled to put distance between them. As the trials commenced and Nick ran for mayor, the distance widened. If her battle with the Police Department cast a shadow over his campaign, his campaign added fuel to the criticism that her prosecution was politically driven. ''Had he run for mayor not now, but next time, ... '' she mused one evening as we sat in her corner office overlooking the dusky skyline. Her voiced trailed off, then she said, ''But this is his dream, and you don't ever want to be discouraging.''\par \par \uc2 Marilyn told me that she and Nick had never talked openly about the distance, but as dinner wound down in my kitchen, it came up.\par \par \uc2 We were talking about the criticism of his influence, and she said, ''I had to establish my own sort of leadership, because I was being accused of him running my office.''\par \par \uc2 Nick turned to Marilyn. ''Our strength has always been working together,'' he said.\par \par \uc2 ''I have to take into consideration the political ramifications,'' she said. ''You may be asking what took place at work, but because I'm so much on guard, I don't want to talk about that. But then that creates this. ... ''\par \par \uc2 ''Chasm,'' Nick said.\par \par \uc2 ''A chasm between us,'' she said.\par \par \uc2 ''There's always going to be some level of disconnect there,'' Nick said. ''I don't see it ever returning back to the level where it was.''\par \par \uc2 Marilyn looked surprised. ''Like you mean the damage has been done?'' she asked.\par \par \uc2 ''It's just like, that's what the relationship is now,'' he said.\par \par \uc2 There was a long silence, and I realized that when you looked at the fallout from Gray's death -- the devastation to his family, the eruption of the city, the polarizing trials and dismissed charges, the rift between cops and prosecutors and the surging violence -- the scars were everywhere in this city, but it sometimes seemed as if the only public figure who had really suffered for his death, who put her career and private life on the line, whether right or wrong, the elected official who paid the highest price was the one who set out to make sure someone did.\par \par \uc2 Sign up for our newsletter to get the best of The \uc2 New York Times Magazine\uc2  delivered to your inbox every week.\par \par \uc2 Wil S.

\par\par \uc2 TALK\par \uc2 Magazine Desk; SECTMM\par \b \uc2 Ana Navarro Wants the G.O.P. to Stand Up to \uc2 Trump\b0\par\par\uc2 Interview by ANA MARIE COX \par \uc2 736 \uc2 words\par \uc2 2 October 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 62\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 You and the other anti-\uc2 Trump\uc2  Republicans have been embraced by a lot of liberals because of the gusto with which you've gone after \uc2 Trump\uc2 . Does that feel a little strange for you? It's very mercurial. The liberals love you until you say something critical about \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 . People have a complete inability to see the flaws in their candidates. God forbid you criticize the blurred lines between the \uc2 Clinton\uc2  philanthropy business and political worlds.\par \par \uc2 But the stuff that she's done, or even has the appearance of impropriety about, is just a different category from being an unstable demagogue. Yes, agreed. Her flaws are within the boundaries of the human race. \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2 's flaws are somewhere in the Martian category.\par \par \uc2 Does being an anti-Trumper have an impact on your personal life? This \uc2 election\uc2  cycle has put a strain on intraparty friendships more than I ever remember. Fortunately, I share my bed with a man who feels exactly the way I do about \uc2 Trump\uc2 . I don't think it would be as toxic within the Republican Party if you had \uc2 Joe Biden\uc2  running for president. Hillary brings out an incredibly strong reaction among a lot of people.\par \par \uc2 Do you think that has anything to do with her sex? I don't. Frankly, a lot of people who feel most strongly against her are women.\par \par \uc2 There's been such strident sexism leveled against her. Even the way \uc2 Trump\uc2  talks about her, that she doesn't have the stamina to be president -- Well, he said the same thing about Jeb Bush. Look, does gender play a part in how people perceive \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 ? Yes. But it's also not the reason people criticize her about the emails or Benghazi. This campaign has been an equal-opportunity criticism-fest. Do we criticize Hillary's hair and bobbing head? Yes. But God knows we criticize \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2 's color and the furry object growing on top of his head. We might be more sensitive to it because she's a woman, but it's been pretty brutal for everybody.\par \par \uc2 Do you think \uc2 Trump\uc2 's nomination will mean that the Republican Party loses Latino or Hispanic voters for generations? If \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  wins, and even maybe if he doesn't win, he has already caused so much harm. I think if there aren't Republicans standing up to \uc2 Trump\uc2 , and showing America that he does not represent the Republican Party, then he has the potential to ruin the brand and turn it into toxic waste for generations.\par \par \uc2 Let's say \uc2 Trump\uc2  wins. What do you think is going to happen to the Republican Party after this cycle? The party is going to have to rebuild, reunite and rebrand. \uc2 Trump\uc2  supporters within the Republican Party love to label mainstream Republicans as ''RINOs,'' or Republicans in name only, or ''establishment,'' and they would love to see those people out of the party. I wasn't particularly good at math, but I know enough arithmetic to know that if you subtract people from a party, your likelihood of winning the majority of the vote is less, not more.\par \par \uc2 Is there a case to be made for splintering into different parties? No. People are supporting \uc2 Trump\uc2  because he's an outsider or because they're fed up with the dysfunction in Washington. Some people just dislike Hillary. I don't think everybody who supports \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  does it because they're racist -- I just don't think it's that simple. You just have to learn how to focus on the stuff you have in common and learn how to live with the difference.\par \par \uc2 What do you find so personally valuable about the party? I fled communism as a child. That's an experience that can shape you forever. The Republican Party that I recognize and that I'm a part of fought communism and totalitarianism, and it just marked me with a loyalty toward those values that I can't just simply let go of. You don't leave bad relationships unless you're in love with somebody else, and \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  doesn't fill my love tank.\par \par \uc2 That is a terrible piece of relationship advice. To each his own.\par \par \uc2 Interview has been condensed and edited.\par \par \uc2 (PHOTOGRAPH BY STEPHEN VOSS) \par \par \uc2 Document NYTF000020161002eca200077\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 In recent years, you've needed a scorecard to keep track of voting laws in the United States. For nearly a decade, Republican-dominated state legislatures have been churning out strict voter ID laws and other measures likely to reduce access to the ballot box. But the pace of activity quickened after June 2013, when the Supreme Court disabled a vital provision of the Voting Rights Act, the so-called preclearance provision, opening the door to restrictive legislation in the nine states (and parts of six others) that had been covered by the law.\par \par \uc2 Within hours of that decision, Shelby v. Holder, Texas announced that it would start enforcing a very strict ID law that had been turned back under the Voting Rights Act and that could affect more than 600,000 registered voters. Alabama and Mississippi followed suit, with laws that created particular hurdles for rural and small-town voters without driver's licenses. North Carolina went further, passing a bill that imposed a strict ID requirement, reduced early voting and eliminated same-day registration. Things looked bleak for voting rights advocates and for the people most likely to be barred from the polls by these laws: members of racial and ethnic minorities, the poor and working class, the elderly and the young.\par \par \uc2 Over the last few months, however, federal courts around the country have overturned, challenged or blocked some of the most restrictive laws, including in Texas, North Carolina and Wisconsin (as well as Ohio's method of purging the voting rolls). The cases differ; many legal issues will remain unsettled until after this year's \uc2 election\uc2 ; and Republicans in North Carolina and Texas have already tried to circumvent the courts' decisions.\par \par \uc2 Nonetheless, judges are indicating that there are limits to the obstacles that states can impose on voters, particularly if those obstacles could disproportionately affect minorities. The list of documents that can be used to establish a voter's identity, for example, ought not be too narrow, and states need to create reasonable ''safety net'' procedures to permit people to vote even if they lack proper identification (such as signing affidavits explaining why they could not obtain the requisite documents).\par \par \uc2 Judges are also expressing growing skepticism about the claim that these laws are needed to prevent fraud since nobody seems able to find evidence that fraud is anything other than a minuscule problem. The United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit even excoriated North Carolina's Legislature -- thus sending a warning to others -- for having gathered data on racial differences in voting behaviors and then using that data to tailor a discriminatory law.\par \par \uc2 But does that mean the laws will have little or no impact in November? Almost certainly not. Many of the ID laws passed in the last decade will still be in force, although the strictest among them will be loosened or even suspended for this \uc2 election\uc2 . Similarly, many of the other new rules will remain in place, though modified in some instances by the courts. These include reductions in early and weekend voting periods and locations, the termination of same-day registration, revived bans on voting by ex-felons, limitations on voter registration drives, purges of the voter rolls, a diminished number of polling places and requirements that immigrants present proof of citizenship to register.\par \par \uc2 It is impossible to gauge with precision how much effect these laws will have. Many of them, including some of the ID laws, have never been in place during a high-turnout presidential \uc2 election\uc2 ; even softened, such laws have the potential to sow confusion among voters and \uc2 election\uc2  officials. Measuring the impact of these laws, moreover, is no easy task. Turnout, even within individual communities, can rise and fall for many reasons, and there is no handy way to tease out the effects of a law.\par \par \uc2 That said, most studies conclude that the new restrictions will reduce the participation of African-Americans, Latinos and poor people generally, most likely by a few percentage points -- and perhaps by as much as eight to 10 percentage points. The figure will surely vary from community to community.\par \par \uc2 The outcomes of some local and even congressional races may well be affected by these laws; and it's not out of the question that they could play a role in a tight presidential contest, although the North Carolina and Wisconsin court decisions make that less likely. The results will almost certainly skew in favor of Republicans: as a growing number of Republican officials have publicly acknowledged -- or been caught saying in private -- that's precisely what they are supposed to do.\par \par \uc2 But the significance of these laws goes far beyond this \uc2 election\uc2 . Laws of this type strike at the rights and the dignity of some of our fellow citizens: A great majority of us will be unaffected, but to others the message sent is that they do not quite belong to the polity.\par \par \uc2 Stories abound: a 93-year-old veteran in Texas turned away from the polls because his driver's license had expired and he lacked other forms of acceptable ID; voters in Arizona who this spring gave up when faced with intolerably long lines created by a drastic reduction in the number of polling sites; people in Florida who completed their felony sentences years ago but are not permitted to vote because \uc2 Gov. Rick Scott\uc2  restored a lifetime ban on voting by felons, which now disenfranchises more than a million people.\par \par \uc2 How might we usher in a new era in which voting will be more open, accessible and democratic? The steps are not hard to imagine, and some have already been taken in several states. (Indeed, a number of blue states, including Oregon, have recently passed laws to make it easier to register and vote.)\par \par \uc2 Registration could be made automatic, when a high school student approaches her 18th birthday or when anyone interacts with a government agency like a motor vehicle office or public assistance agency. ID requirements could be loosened, and it could become the responsibility of government, not individuals, to make sure everyone has an appropriate ID (as is the case in many countries). Someone who showed up at the polls without a valid document could be allowed to cast a provisional ballot and, on the spot, apply for an ID, with the aid of officials who would know how to troubleshoot the process.\par \par \uc2 Election\uc2  Day could be a holiday or a Sunday, with the option of absentee voting easily available. Congress could, and should, pass legislation, such as the Voting Rights Advancement Act, that would restore the preclearance provision of the law with an updated formula to determine which states are covered, and a nationwide mandate to increase the transparency of changes to \uc2 election\uc2  rules. We could even go whole hog and put a right to vote in our Constitution, a venerable idea now promoted by two Democratic representatives, Mark Pocan of Wisconsin and Keith Ellison of Minnesota.\par \par \uc2 It is a mark of our times that this agenda -- which would yield a less conflict-ridden and more inclusive electoral system -- sounds like an old-fashioned civics textbook and yet politically na\u239\'00\'EFve, utopian even. In fact, no such reform program will be widely put in place as long as most Republicans (there are notable exceptions) cling to the shortsighted belief that their interests will be served by reducing turnout among poor people, African-Americans, Hispanics and students. Or as long as they believe their own mythmaking about the prevalence of fraud: According to a recent poll, two-thirds of \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2 's supporters are convinced that electoral fraud occurs often -- and it's simply not true.\par \par \uc2 Still, the historical record offers glimmers of hope: previous eras of disenfranchisement or voter suppression have come to an end. This has sometimes happened within states when a political party fostering suppressive or exclusive laws recognizes that, despite those laws, its hold on power may be slipping away thanks to social or demographic changes and that it would be best to stop antagonizing (and even court) blocs of potential voters. One could imagine this happening sooner or later in North Carolina, Georgia and even Texas.\par \par \uc2 An alternative path involves the federal government. At key historical junctures, both Congress and the courts have overridden state laws in order to protect core democratic rights. In 1935, the Supreme Court upheld the ''whites only'' Democratic primary in Texas; nine years later, with new justices on the court and a million uniformed African-Americans fighting overseas, it reversed that decision. Congress acted similarly in 1869 and 1919, when it approved constitutional amendments prohibiting disenfranchisement based on race and gender, and again in 1965, when it first passed the Voting Rights Act.\par \par \uc2 At the moment we do not have either a Congress or a Supreme Court that seems much inclined to take steps of this type. But that could be one more reason to vote in November.\par \par \uc2 For the video: Kelly Duane de la Vega is an Emmy-nominated documentary filmmaker whose most recent feature, ''The Return,'' on which the Op-Doc ''A Ride Home From Prison'' is based, won the 2016 Tribeca Film Festival Audience Award for Best Documentary.

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 LET me raise an uncomfortable topic: We all know that in some fundamental way, this presidential campaign is in part about race.\par \par \uc2 Supporters of \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  are more likely than other voters to tell pollsters that blacks are ''lazy,'' ''violent'' and ''unintelligent.'' Four out of five \uc2 Trump\uc2  backers say that discrimination against whites is as big a problem as discrimination against blacks. And only 39 percent of \uc2 Trump\uc2  supporters believe that President \uc2 Obama\uc2  was born in the United States.\par \par \uc2 Polling and analysis by The Economist found that \uc2 Trump\uc2  is propelled in part by a wave of white ''racial resentment'' that blacks are coddled whiners, protected by a stifling political correctness.\par \par \uc2 As for \uc2 Trump\uc2  himself, we shouldn't lightly call anyone a racist, but he has compiled such a comprehensive record of discrimination and bigotry over 45 years that I don't know what else to call him.\par \par \uc2 I started this ''When Whites Just Don't Get It'' series a couple of years ago because I thought many whites were in denial about racial inequities. That impression has only been reinforced by \uc2 Trump\uc2 's rise.\par \par \uc2 A widespread white delusion goes like this: We elected a black man president, so let's stop using past discrimination as an excuse for black failures today. The age of discrimination is over.\par \par \uc2 In fact, the evidence is overwhelming that racial discrimination remains ubiquitous in America.\par \par \uc2 Take something as simple as crossing the street. In one study by scholars at Portland State University and the \uc2 University of Arizona\uc2 , three black men and three white men played pedestrians trying to cross a street at a crosswalk. On average, a black pedestrian was passed by twice as many vehicles before a driver yielded.\par \par \uc2 As I see it, the biggest problem with racism in 2016 is not old-fashioned white-robed segregationists (although white supremacists are lining up to promote \uc2 Trump\uc2 ). Rather, the central problem is well-meaning white people like the drivers at those crosswalks: Many probably believe in racial equality, yet they unintentionally act in ways that perpetuate inequality.\par \par \uc2 Researchers find this kind of unconscious bias almost everywhere. A Stanford study found that teachers reviewing discipline reports in some cases were more likely to favor harsh punishment for a student named ''Deshawn'' or ''Darnell'' than one named ''Greg'' or ''Jake.'' And black children with appendicitis are less than half as likely to get strong pain medication at an emergency room as white children with appendicitis.\par \par \uc2 Businesses that discriminate seem to hurt themselves, but they still do it.\par \par \uc2 Devah Pager of Harvard conducted a study of racial discrimination in New York City in 2004 by sending young black and white men to apply for jobs at 170 businesses, bearing fictitious and carefully matched r\u233\'00\'E9sum\u233\'00\'E9s. She found that white applicants were more than twice as likely to get a call back; indeed, a white applicant purportedly just released from prison did no worse than a black applicant with a clean record.\par \par \uc2 This year, Pager published a follow-up based on what had happened to these businesses in the 2008 recession. She found that the companies that had discriminated were significantly more likely to have gone out of business -- which may suggest a price tag for discrimination.\par \par \uc2 Inequities are not just about individual discrimination, for the larger problems are systemic. I was just in Detroit, where 9 percent of children suffer lead poisoning (more than in Flint); if this were happening to rich white children on the Upper East Side of Manhattan, there would be outraged demands for a national commission and reparations.\par \par \uc2 When opioids were primarily a black problem, America's instinct was harsh prison sentences; now that it is mainly a white problem, we're more compassionate and are improving treatment programs. America's education system is structured so that white suburban children often get an excellent public education, while inner-city black kids disproportionally get a third-rate education.\par \par \uc2 The Supreme Court is now taking up a case called Buck v. Davis involving a murderer named Duane Buck who was sentenced to death after ''expert'' testimony that he was more likely to commit violent crimes in the future because he was black. What can that be called but racism?\par \par \uc2 Many whites object that race gaps are the result of irresponsible behavior by blacks themselves, such as teenage girls' having babies. Sure, self-destructive behaviors are a strand of poverty (of every complexion), but blacks are cleareyed about this: 86 percent of blacks say that family breakup is a reason for difficulties of African-Americans today. And black churches and opinion leaders like President \uc2 Obama\uc2  have addressed this head-on with initiatives like My Brother's Keeper.\par \par \uc2 In contrast, we whites seem curiously unwilling to shoulder any responsibility for our own part in racial inequity. If we're so concerned with ''personal responsibility,'' shouldn't we show some?\par \par \uc2 If \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  wants to make this \uc2 election\uc2  in part about race, then let's really talk about race problems in all their complexities. And we whites could spend less time pointing fingers and more time looking in the mirror.\par \par \uc2 I invite you to sign up for my free, twice-weekly email newsletter.

HOBERMAN \par \uc2 1,310 \uc2 words\par \uc2 2 October 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 14\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 A scurrilous political satire, ''Wild in the Streets'' opened in the spring of 1968 and played more or less continuously in drive-ins and grindhouse theaters throughout that convulsive \uc2 election\uc2  year.\par \par \uc2 Opposition to the Vietnam War was reaching its height and, in the wake of the catastrophic Democratic convention in Chicago, Fortune magazine estimated that a million young Americans identified with Students for a Democratic Society and other manifestations of the ''New Left.''\par \par \uc2 ''Wild in the Streets,'' directed by Barry Shear from a script by Robert Thom (elaborating on his Esquire article ''The Day It All Happened, Baby'') reflected, even as it satirized, a fearful fascination with the Kids. The movie industry calculated that more than half of its audience was under 25; in its own way, ''Wild in the Streets'' parodies Hollywood's bemused efforts to reach younger viewers.\par \par \uc2 [Video: Trailer: 'Wild in the Streets' Watch on \uc2 YouTube\uc2 .]\par \par \uc2 Max Frost, a 22-year-old rock musician (Christopher Jones, star of the short-lived TV series ''The Legend of Jesse James''), dupes a pandering, 37-year-old senator (Hal Holbrook, hair combed over his forehead in the style of Robert Kennedy's) into supporting an amendment that would lower the voting age to 14. Benefiting from this newly enfranchised electorate, as well as a bit of LSD in the drinking water, Max himself takes power, putting everyone over 35 in New Age re-education camps.\par \par \uc2 The perpetually smirking Mr. Jones offers an amusing impersonation of James Dean doing Hitler. But the movie's high point is a scene where Diane Varsi, playing the most zonked member of Max's entourage (which includes a young Richard Pryor), addresses Congress as if from the stage of the Fillmore. Wearing a bicorn hat and lazily shaking her tambourine, she giggles that ''America's greatest contribution has been to teach the world that getting old is such a drag.''\par \par \uc2 Although the movie's pop-star-run-amok premise is similar to that of the British filmmaker Peter Watkins's more sober ''Privilege,'' released in the United States during the summer of 1967, Mr. Thom might well have been inspired by the Doors singer Jim Morrison, who for several years had been performing ''When the Music's Over'' with its cri de coeur ending: ''We want the world and we want it... Nah-ow-OW!!!''\par \par \uc2 ''Wild in the Streets'' would surely have been better scored by the Doors, but the film's songs, mainly written by Barry Mann and Cynthia Weil and performed by a studio band complete with a sound like Strawberry Alarm Clock, are not bad. (''The Shape of Things to Come'' by the fake band Max Frost and the Troopers actually went to No. 22 in September 1968.) The reviews were also surprisingly good. Renata Adler, in The Times, called the movie ''by far the best American film of the year so far,'' and compared it, not altogether humorously, to ''The Battle of Algiers.''\par \par \uc2 In its cartoonish way, ''Wild in the Streets'' prophesied Yippie threats, student uprisings, China's Red Guards and the Kent State massacre. Amid one crisis, Max's devoted, smothering mother (Shelley Winters) declares her faith that her son must have ''a very good reason for paralyzing the country,'' anticipating the moment when the mother of the student leader Mark Rudd, a prominent figure in the occupation of \uc2 Columbia University\uc2 , fondly described him to Time magazine as ''my son, the revolutionary.''\par \par \uc2 ''Wild in the Streets'' may be an artifact of 1968, but its image of generational megalomania provides an ominous footnote to the current presidential \uc2 election\uc2 , which could be the last to be waged by two baby boomers. The campaign documentary ''Weiner,'' directed by Josh Kriegman and Elyse Steinberg, has even greater relevance to the current state of American politics -- and not just because its release on disc, from Sundance Selects, coincides with another pitiful development in the career of the former Brooklyn congressman and onetime mayoral hopeful Anthony Weiner.\par \par \uc2 ''Weiner'' is very much a media story. Mr. Weiner is shown to have been partly created by \uc2 C-Span\uc2  and totally undone by \uc2 Twitter\uc2 , with help from New York's tabloid press. His apparently compulsive exhibitionism -- sending images of his private parts to women he met online -- is less a crime than a character flaw. But it dramatizes the reckless, pathological need for approval and the public demand for self-exposure that haunt the current political climate.\par \par \uc2 Reviewing ''Weiner'' for The Times when it opened theatrically in May, Stephen Holden called it ''infuriating and depressing but rivetingly watchable'' -- a phrase that characterizes the movie's subject as well. Mr. Weiner is an articulate man with many ideas and a grievous lack of self-knowledge, a schoolyard show-off seemingly driven by an overwhelming desire for public adulation. The considerable access that the filmmakers enjoy is also symptomatic of Mr. Weiner's narcissism, as are scenes that show him leading gay pride and Israel day parades with near hysterical gusto.\par \par \uc2 When Mr. Weiner's mayoral campaign is wrecked by another sexting scandal, he spars futilely with reporters, entertaining the filmmakers with his impersonation of the comedian Rodney Dangerfield. Attention shifts to his despairing press secretary, Barbara Morgan, and his mortified wife, Huma Abedin, a close associate of \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 . It is then that Ms. Abedin's evident if largely unarticulated exasperation makes for the movie's most compelling drama. (They have since separated.)\par \par \uc2 Mr. Weiner's mindless pugnacity, meanwhile, outlives even his capacity for self-destruction. One is left with the impression that he would play a punching bag if it served to keep him in the ring.\par \par \uc2 NEWLY RELEASED\par \par \uc2 ALL THE WAY Bryan Cranston plays President Lyndon B. Johnson with Anthony Mackie as the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. in the \uc2 HBO\uc2  version of Robert Schenkkan's stage play. In his review for The \uc2 New York Times\uc2  in May, Neil Genzlinger wrote, ''Given all we hear about the current climate in Washington, 'All the Way' is enough to make you misty for the days when horse-trading in the interest of securing significant achievements was what national politicians did.'' Available on Blu-ray and DVD. (\uc2 HBO\uc2 )\par \par \uc2 CHIMES AT MIDNIGHT Orson Welles directed himself as Falstaff in the most expansive of his Shakespearean films, originally released in 1966 and drawing on ''Henry IV,'' ''Henry V'' and ''The Merry Wives of Windsor.'' It's hard to imagine anyone playing the role better. The digital restoration comes loaded with interviews, including one made with Welles while editing the film. On Blu-ray, DVD and Amazon Video. (Criterion)\par \par \uc2 THE DEADLY TRACKERS A project that originally involved Samuel Fuller, this 1973 revenge western, now out on Blu-ray, was ultimately directed by Barry Shear. Richard Harris plays an implacable Texas sheriff who pursues Rod Taylor's murderous villain into Mexico. (Warner Archive)\par \par \uc2 THE DEFENDERS: SEASON ONE Reginald Rose's courtroom series arrived in September 1961 with E. G. Marshall and Robert Reed playing a father-son team of progressive defense lawyers. It quickly established itself as the TV paradigm of New Frontier social consciousness. The nine DVDs include all 32 episodes, including one of the several written by Robert Thom. (Shout!)\par \par \uc2 THE PRESIDENT An overthrown tyrant takes it on the lam, traveling incognito through his unidentified country, in the distinguished Iranian filmmaker Mohsen Makhmalbaf's 2014 drama, shot in the Republic of Georgia. In his June 2016 review for The Times, Ben Kenigsberg described the film's moral: ''Democracy can't take root until the impulse for vengeance is gone.'' On DVD.

\par\par \uc2 OP-ED COLUMNIST\par \uc2 Sunday Review Desk; SECTSR\par \b \uc2 Trump\uc2  and the Intellectuals\b0\par\par\uc2 By ROSS DOUTHAT \par \uc2 903 \uc2 words\par \uc2 2 October 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 11\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 THE Republican Party's politicians have mostly surrendered to \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2 . The Republican Party's entertainers have mostly been enthusiastic about his candidacy. But the conservative intelligentsia -- journalists, think-tankers and academics -- has been conspicuous in its resistance.\par \par \uc2 Now, though, we have ''Writers and Scholars for America'' -- a collection of prominent signatories to the proposition that given the available options, ''\uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2  is the candidate most likely to restore the promise of America.''\par \par \uc2 The list of names is an interesting mix: There are hacks of the sort who inevitably flutter toward \uc2 Trump\uc2 's flame, but there are also writers I've admired for many years. And while there is no unifying manifesto, it's possible to piece together the arguments that attract these thinkers to \uc2 Trump\uc2 's candidacy.\par \par \uc2 Those arguments seem at first blush to be in tension. On the one hand, many of the pro-\uc2 Trump\uc2  thinkers seem to believe that for all his distinctive vices, \uc2 Trump\uc2  would probably end up governing largely as a conventional Republican. Believing as they do that liberal ideas are dangerous or destructive, these conservatives see the 2016 \uc2 election\uc2  as a straightforward lesser of two evils situation, in which the Republican nominee's indecency is preferable to the damage that a Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  presidency would all but guarantee.\par \par \uc2 But then you also have others who are attracted to \uc2 Trump\uc2  precisely because he isn't a conventional Republican. Reagan-era conservatism had its time and failed, these \uc2 Trump\uc2 -supporting intellectuals suggest, and the time has come to roll the dice, to embrace a change agent even if he seems gross and seedy and bigoted, because the alternative is staying on a fatal course.\par \par \uc2 Some of these writers feel that the American republic has already gone under, we're just choosing between elected emperors, and you might as well gamble on a Caesar who's willing to flay the empire's ruling class. Others take the more modest view that \uc2 Trump\uc2  is correct on particular issues (immigration, foreign policy, the importance of the nation-state) where the bipartisan consensus is often wrong, and his candidacy is a chance to vote against an elite worldview that desperately needs to be chastened and rebuked.\par \par \uc2 I said that these two perspectives seem to be in tension, but it's actually pretty easy to combine them. If \uc2 Trump\uc2  gets restrained by his advisers, he'll be a typical Republican, this combination would go, and if he stays true to his own essential Trumpiness, he'll be the scourge our rotten system needs.\par \par \uc2 If ideas were all, this would be a plausible argument. \uc2 Trump\uc2  is too mercurial to be fully trusted on judicial appointments or any other issue that matters to the right. But it's reasonable to think that the way he's campaigned -- on a mix of standard-issue Republican ideas and populist-nationalist heresies -- is the way that he will try to govern.\par \par \uc2 But the problem comes in with that one word, ''try.''\par \par \uc2 Set aside for a moment \uc2 Trump\uc2 's low character, his penchant for inflaming racial tensions, his personal corruptions. Assume for the sake of argument that all that can be folded into a ''lesser of two evils'' case.\par \par \uc2 What remains is this question: Can \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  actually execute the basic duties of the presidency? Is there any way that his administration won't be a flaming train wreck from the start? Is there any possibility that he'll be levelheaded in a crisis -- be it another 9/11 or financial meltdown, or any of the lesser-but-still-severe challenges that presidents reliably face?\par \par \uc2 I think we have seen enough from his campaign -- up to and including his wretchedly stupid conduct since the first debate -- to answer confidently, ''No.'' \uc2 Trump\uc2 's zest for self-sabotage, his wild swings, his inability to delegate or take advice, are not mere flaws; they are defining characteristics. The burdens of the presidency will leave him permanently maddened, perpetually undone.\par \par \uc2 Even if that undoing doesn't lead to economic or geopolitical calamity (yes, Virginia, there are worse things than the Iraq War), which cause or idea associated with Trumpism is likely to emerge stronger after a four-year train wreck? Not populism or immigration restrictionism. Not evangelical Christianity. Not economic conservatism. They'll all be lashed to the mast of a burning ship whose captain is angrily tweeting from the poop deck.\par \par \uc2 Months ago, I worried that \uc2 Trump\uc2  was too authoritarian to be entrusted with the presidency. That worry has receded a bit, because authoritarianism requires a ruthless sort of competence that \uc2 Trump\uc2  cannot attain.\par \par \uc2 But fecklessness in the presidency can be as destructive as malice, and not just to the country: A disastrous chief executive can do devastating damage to his own political ideas.\par \par \uc2 In this sense the intellectuals' case for \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  fails because it cannot shake free of those ideas and see the personal element here clearly.\par \par \uc2 What \uc2 Trump\uc2  believes, what he intends to do in office -- those questions are ultimately secondary to the problem of the man himself, and the near-certainty that he will fail, and in failing, betray anyone who has lent him their support.\par \par \uc2 I invite you to follow me on Twitter (@DouthatNYT).\par \par \uc2 Follow The \uc2 New York Times\uc2  Opinion section on \uc2 Facebook\uc2  and Twitter (@NYTopinion), and sign up for the Opinion Today newsletter.\par \par \uc2 Document NYTF000020161002eca20005e\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

The figures leave Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  well positioned for a final spending splurge on television, digital outreach and field mobilization as polls show her moving slightly ahead of \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 The figures show Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  behind the blazing pace set by President Obama in his 2012 re-\uc2 election\uc2  bid, when Mr. Obama and the Democrats raised $181 million in September.\par \par \uc2 In past months, Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  has performed less well with small donors than Mr. Obama and her former rival Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont had.\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 Clinton\uc2  campaign did not release details that would provide insight into her small-donor fund-raising in September.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  has not yet announced his September fund-raising totals, but this week said he raised $18 million after the first debate, on Monday. That money was a mix of large and small donations, he said.\par \par \uc2 Both candidates and their parties will be required to report more detailed information this month.\par \par \uc2 Find out what you need to know about the 2016 presidential race today, and get politics news updates via \uc2 Facebook\uc2 , \uc2 Twitter\uc2  and the First Draft newsletter.\par \par \uc2 Document NYTF000020161002eca20005l\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 OP-ED COLUMNIST\par \uc2 Editorial Desk; SECTSR\par \b \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2 's Pathetic Fraternity\b0\par\par\uc2 By FRANK BRUNI \par \uc2 1,185 \uc2 words\par \uc2 2 October 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 3\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Over decades of writing about politics, I've crossed paths with many candidates and office holders who impressed me, but few who blew me away.\par \par \uc2 Chris Christie\uc2  blew me away. This was three and a half years ago, well before all the trouble. The New Jersey governor was addressing a group of education reformers. And he did what looks easy until you try it yourself: talked without notes, slogans, stammers or any other clumsiness for close to a half-hour. It was too specific a speech to be one that he'd pulled from memory; he was thinking on his feet, in shapely paragraphs. He radiated conviction. He oozed authority.\par \par \uc2 What in God's name happened to him? To his potential? Yes, yes, I know: the George Washington Bridge happened. And the downgrade of New Jersey's credit rating happened -- again and again and again.\par \par \uc2 But while those events explain his diminished political fortunes and failed presidential campaign, they didn't force him into his current role as a prime defender of an indefensible man. I looked up two weeks ago and he was on \uc2 CNN\uc2 , peddling the brazen lie that \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  hadn't spent the last five years raising questions about President Obama's birthplace. He radiated insincerity. He oozed subservience.\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 Trump\uc2  campaign has shown me many things that I never thought I'd see and others that I'd never seen so clearly, including the readiness of power-hungry men to trade dignity for relevance and swap pride for a place at the table, even if the table is a despicable one.\par \par \uc2 Christie made that deal with shocking alacrity, apparently on the theory that by getting to the table first, he could snag the best seat. It was flawed thinking. \uc2 Mike Pence\uc2  was given the marquee assignment; Christie was subjected to repeated public humiliations, including an admonition by \uc2 Trump\uc2  to stay away from Oreos.\par \par \uc2 Rudy Giuliani\uc2  made that deal, too, and \uc2 Trump\uc2  has been his ticket to a renewed and terrifying omnipresence. His expression -- part sneer, part glare, all menace -- turns small forest creatures to stone. At the sound of his voice, roses drop their petals.\par \par \uc2 He was railing last week about \uc2 Bill \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's sexual history, a kooky case for him, in particular, to prosecute. Back when he was the mayor of New York, he was no choirboy, and his wife then -- No. 2 of three -- learned in a famously cruel fashion that he'd be leaving her. He announced it at a news conference.\par \par \uc2 But then hypocrisy and irony aren't words with much currency on Team \uc2 Trump\uc2 , which is crowded with men, starting with \uc2 Trump\uc2  himself, whose ugly track records with marriage don't inhibit them from condemning the Clintons' union and whose viciousness toward women doesn't stop them from damning the Clintons as vicious toward women.\par \par \uc2 Over recent days, in a spectacularly ill-advised war of words with the former Miss Universe Alicia Machado, he and his minions sought to discredit her by essentially calling her a tramp. Isn't that precisely what they're complaining that the Clintons and their minions did to Monica Lewinsky?\par \par \uc2 Giuliani's gripes range far and wide: President Obama doesn't love America; \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  is secretly on death's door; Lester Holt displayed an awful prejudice against \uc2 Trump\uc2  at the first presidential debate.\par \par \uc2 It's all wild hallucination, but he bellows nonetheless, because the television cameras eat it up. In this wretched race there's a leitmotif of cockamamie cameos from men who are stars no more. It's not exclusive to Republicans. Howard Dean had a Giuliani moment all his own, suggesting that \uc2 Trump\uc2 , who doesn't even drink alcohol, might have a nasty cocaine habit. Who engages in such rash slander? Someone itching to be heard.\par \par \uc2 Newt Gingrich\uc2  knows that itch, and he, too, has been scratching it lately, in the service of \uc2 Trump\uc2 . He repeated baseless rumors that \uc2 Clinton\uc2  got the debate questions in advance. He piped up to say that Machado deserved to be shamed for her weight gain. His reasoning went something like this: Live by the sash, die by the sash. It's amazing how much physical license men will give themselves while giving women none. It's amazing how oblivious they are to the paradox.\par \par \uc2 It's amazing how alike some of the manservants clinging to \uc2 Trump\uc2  are: His campaign is like some Canyon Ranch for bullies needing revitalization.\par \par \uc2 And it's amazing how far they've fallen. For a significant stretch of the 2008 \uc2 election\uc2  cycle, Giuliani was the favorite for the G.O.P. presidential nomination, and not just any favorite. He was going to prove that a Northeastern Republican who flouted certain right-wing orthodoxies could travel a somewhat centrist path to the White House.\par \par \uc2 That mantle passed to Christie. Some Republicans tried to draw him into the 2012 presidential race, then anointed him as the 2016 front-runner -- before the bridge fiasco, that is. He, like Giuliani, was hailed in some quarters as a choice more sensible than stringently ideological.\par \par \uc2 ''Sensible'' isn't an adjective you associate with either man these days. Both sacrificed it to their orange overlord.\par \par \uc2 It's the nature of politics to forge alliances of convenience -- and to swallow some principles in the process. Plenty of people in \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's inner and outer circles balk at her secretive ways and shudder at her compromises. To be with her, they've made compromises of their own.\par \par \uc2 But not on the scale of the ones made by \uc2 Trump\uc2 's cabal. Not with the same price or risk.\par \par \uc2 If \uc2 Trump\uc2  fails, where does that leave Christie? He was once intent on proving the bipartisan breadth of his outlook and appeal, as his brief bromance with President Obama demonstrated. He was ''an exceptionally gifted and nuanced politician,'' wrote my colleague Mark Leibovich in a 2014 profile of him.\par \par \uc2 But he will be known forevermore for his enabling of \uc2 Trump\uc2 , who has absolutely no nuance -- and not much of a conscience, either. In a recent Rutgers-Eagleton Poll, fewer than one in four New Jersey residents viewed Christie favorably. That has something to do with the company he's keeping.\par \par \uc2 He obviously felt that he had nowhere else to go, not if he wanted to stay on the political stage. New Jersey voters aren't likely to elect him to anything ever again.\par \par \uc2 But there are other theaters in this life. He has options. What I initially saw in him wasn't proof of good governance, but it was evidence of an undeniable intelligence and a remarkable magnetism. They could be put to uses so much nobler than what he's doing now, which is the kind of charade that leaves so many Americans so cynical and sour.\par \par \uc2 I invite you to follow me on Twitter (@FrankBruni) and join me on \uc2 Facebook\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Follow The \uc2 New York Times\uc2  Opinion section on \uc2 Facebook\uc2  and Twitter (@NYTopinion), and sign up for the Opinion Today newsletter.\par \par \uc2 DRAWING (DRAWING BY BEN WISEMAN) \par \par \uc2 Document NYTF000020161002eca20004s\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 National Desk; SECTA\par \b \uc2 Asian-Americans' Drift Left Is Cause for Republican Worry\b0\par\par\uc2 By JEREMY W. PETERS \par \uc2 1,491 \uc2 words\par \uc2 2 October 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 1\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 LAS VEGAS -- On paper at least, Asian-Americans seem like perfect Republicans. Many are small-business owners. Their communities tend to be more culturally conservative. And a lot of them, having fled oppressive Communist governments, found comfort in the Republican Party's aggressive anti-Communist policies.\par \par \uc2 But in what could be a significant realignment of political allegiance, Asian-Americans are identifying as Democrats at a quicker pace than any other racial group. And many Republicans worry this \uc2 election\uc2  will only accelerate that trend, damaging their party for years to come with what is now the fastest-growing minority in the country.\par \par \uc2 The Republican presidential nominee, \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , is not helping. His attacks on the Chinese -- which he has sometimes delivered in a crude, mocking accent -- are a feature of his populist campaign. He has suggested cutting off immigration from the Philippines, citing fears that the longtime American ally poses the same national security threat as countries like Syria and Afghanistan.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's talk of deporting millions of undocumented immigrants has also stirred up painful memories among a group that has been singled out under American law before, whether by the Chinese Exclusion Act, which barred the immigration of Chinese laborers until 1943, or by the internment of Japanese-Americans during World War II.\par \par \uc2 ''It's like we're going back in time,'' said Marc Matsuo of Las Vegas, who grew up in Hawaii with parents of Japanese ancestry and recalled how his family used to feel uncomfortable expressing their heritage, to the point they would not speak Japanese. He now helps register Asian-Americans to vote. ''I was always brought up that you don't talk about religion, you don't talk about politics. Not anymore.''\par \par \uc2 Though Asian-Americans are still just 4 percent of the overall eligible voting population, their political power is concentrated in important swing states like Nevada and Virginia, where both parties have been building on their efforts to reach out.\par \par \uc2 In and around Las Vegas, home to one of the country's largest Asian populations, this means printing campaign leaflets in Korean, having a Vietnamese translator on standby at speeches, publishing op-ed articles in the local Filipino newspaper and hiring employees who know enough Mandarin to recruit voters at the Chinatown seafood market.\par \par \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's campaign has a resident staff member in Las Vegas dedicated to Asian-Americans and Pacific Islanders. Staff members and volunteers here speak Chinese, Korean, Hindi and Tagalog, the Filipino language. The campaign has recently been conducting native language training on how to use voting machines in a local Chinese cultural center. Volunteers are sent to court supporters in Buddhist temples.\par \par \uc2 Though Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's campaign announced a new Asian Pacific American Advisory Committee last week, a Republican National Committee spokesman, Ninio Fetalvo, said Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's outreach to Asian-American voters had been coordinated until now mainly through two staff members at the party's Washington headquarters. The party, he added, has also printed materials in a variety of Asian languages in cities like Las Vegas.\par \par \uc2 Republicans' difficulties with Asian-Americans are similar to those the party has faced with most minority groups. A sense that the party is hostile to immigrants and minorities has driven more Asian-American voters into the Democratic Party lately, political scientists and community leaders said. And if Republicans do not make more of an effort, those voting shifts could harden, just as Hispanics' voting patterns have.\par \par \uc2 ''What we see now are some early indications that people who either leaned toward the Democratic Party or did not identify with either party are now starting to identify as Democrats,'' said Karthick Ramakrishnan, a professor of political science at the University of California, Riverside. ''This is still a group that is making up its mind,'' he added, ''but it should be concerning to the Republican Party that you're starting to see this crystallization.''\par \par \uc2 A national survey in the spring by Asian and Pacific Islander American Vote, a nonpartisan research group, showed ''a significant leftward shift'' since 2012 among Asian-American registered voters, with 47 percent now identifying with the Democratic Party, compared with 35 percent in 2012. Fifteen percent identified as Republican.\par \par \uc2 In 1992, the year national exit polls started reporting Asian-American sentiment, the group leaned Republican, supporting George Bush over \uc2 Bill \uc2 Clinton\uc2  55 percent to 31 percent. But by 2012, that had reversed. Asian-Americans overwhelmingly supported President Obama over \uc2 Mitt Romney\uc2  -- 73 percent to 26 percent, almost the same margin by which Hispanics favored Mr. Obama.\par \par \uc2 A \uc2 Pew Research Center\uc2  report released last month showed that Asian-Americans have since 2008 embraced the Democratic Party at a faster rate than any other ethnic group.\par \par \uc2 Still, many Republicans believe that the damage is reversible and see Asian-Americans' political identity as still very young and malleable. For example, among many Asian-Americans, there is a tendency to be less forgiving on illegal immigration, which is sometimes seen -- unfairly or not -- as an issue specific to Latinos.\par \par \uc2 Lanhee Chen, who was \uc2 Mitt Romney\uc2 's policy director in 2012, said the effect of Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's harsh talk on immigration could be more muted with Asian-Americans than it is with other minorities. ''\uc2 Trump\uc2  has not been helpful,'' Mr. Chen said. ''Now is it as directly harmful as it would be to Latinos? I don't think so.''\par \par \uc2 As Asian-Americans have replaced Hispanics as the nation's fastest growing racial group, Nevada has become the center of their emerging political class. Asian-Americans are now about 7 percent of the electorate in the state, a figure that is expected to double by 2060.\par \par \uc2 Democrats and Republicans have concluded that winning in closely divided Nevada requires performing strongly among Asian-Americans: The state's Republican senator, Dean Heller, carried Asian-Americans when he narrowly won in 2012. And Harry Reid, the state's long-serving Democratic senator who is retiring, performed even better with them than he did among Hispanics in his 2010 \uc2 election\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 None of which is lost on the two candidates vying to succeed Mr. Reid: Representative Joe Heck, the Republican, employs an aide who speaks Mandarin and has made Kamayan dinners -- traditional Filipino banquets -- as much a campaign staple as marching in parades. And Catherine Cortez Masto, the Democrat, grew up in the Las Vegas neighborhood that has since become the city's Chinatown, with Korean barbecue restaurants, Vietnamese noodle bars, foot spas and Chinese arches. When she attended a lunar celebration last month, she spoke in English as someone translated her words into Vietnamese.\par \par \uc2 As much as Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's positions seem to be driving Asian-Americans into the Democratic Party, the group defies easy political categorization. Many Koreans are evangelical Christians. Filipinos overwhelmingly belong to the Roman Catholic Church. Many Vietnamese who emigrated during the war identify closely with the Republican Party's anti-Communism.\par \par \uc2 ''In general, Asian values are very much in line with Republican values: family, education, the country needs to be stable,'' said \uc2 James Yu\uc2 , a member of the Las Vegas Asian Chamber of Commerce, which has endorsed Mr. Heck in the Senate race. Notably, it has not backed Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 By November, about 9.3 million Asian-Americans will be able to vote nationally, or 4 percent of the eligible voting population. That is up from eight million in 2012. And that growth has spawned new civic organizations, like the nonpartisan Asian Community Development Council in Las Vegas, which aims to boost the group's low voter turnout. Only 47 percent of eligible Asian-Americans voted in 2012.\par \par \uc2 Vida Chan Lin, the group's founder, said that her message each time she goes out to register Asian-Americans to vote -- in casinos' employee lunchrooms, in Chinatown shopping malls and at employee orientations for businesses like the \uc2 Panda Express\uc2  fast-food chain -- is that they have to harness the power of their growing numbers.\par \par \uc2 ''We've got to get them to vote,'' Ms. Lin said in her office, which was humming with volunteers planning registration drives, as well as follow-up calls as reminders to vote.\par \par \uc2 One positive consequence of Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's divisiveness, she said, was that interest in the \uc2 election\uc2  is like nothing she has ever seen. And the chatter about it follows her everywhere, she added: ''When I went to China, they were talking about it.''\par \par \uc2 Find out what you need to know about the 2016 presidential race today, and get politics news updates via \uc2 Facebook\uc2 , \uc2 Twitter\uc2  and the First Draft newsletter.\par \par \uc2 Top, a diner reading a newspaper with coverage of Monday's presidential debate at a restaurant in the Chinatown neighborhood of Las Vegas.

\par\par \uc2 National Desk; SECTA\par \b \uc2 Looking to Expand Lead With Hispanics\b0\par\par\uc2 By NICK CORASANITI \par \uc2 786 \uc2 words\par \uc2 2 October 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 22\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's campaign and the main group supporting it, Priorities USA, hit the airwaves this week with new Spanish-language ads as they look to increase their lead among Hispanic voters in key swing states. An ad called ''Disappear,'' from Priorities, focuses on deportation.\par \par \uc2 THE AD A Hispanic family smiles and shares a box of cereal around a table, but they quickly fade from the scene, leaving an unswept table and dirty dishes. ''This is a country where we speak English,'' Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  is heard saying, with subtitles in Spanish. The disappearance motif builds through the spot: A woman working at her laptop fades away, her computer screen still flashing; a family reading a book in bed vanishes, followed by a woman studying on the lawn.\par \par \uc2 ''\uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  wants to see us disappear,'' the narrator says in Spanish. Spliced between each disappearance are quotes from Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , discussing his deportation plans: ''I want everybody out.''\par \par \uc2 THE MESSAGE Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's hard-line immigration policies, which experts have estimated would lead to the deportation of millions of unauthorized immigrants in the country, would lead to the loss of friends, family members and neighbors in Hispanic communities.\par \par \uc2 TAKEAWAY The \uc2 Clinton\uc2  team has made Hispanic outreach a cornerstone of its advertising efforts, spending more than $2.5 million on Spanish-language advertising on broadcast alone, according to Kantar Media/CMAG. This ad, combined with an ad from the \uc2 Clinton\uc2  campaign highlighting Hispanic residents proudly proclaiming that they are voting in their first \uc2 election\uc2 , seeks to harness that energy just as early voting is beginning. Immediately after the first debate, \uc2 Google\uc2  searches for ''voter registration'' surged in Hispanic communities, where high turnout is essential for Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  to win in states crucial to her victory, like Colorado and Florida.\par \par \uc2 A recent Mason-Dixon poll found Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  down 35 points to Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  among Hispanics in Florida. These ads, coming as Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  escalated his feud with a former Miss Universe, Alicia Machado, who is Hispanic, have made for a tough week for Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  among Hispanic voters.\par \par \uc2 Changing channels ...\par \par \uc2 Asked and Answered\par \par \uc2 Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  just discovered the dangers of a rhetorical question, courtesy of a new \uc2 Trump\uc2  ad. Not long after she said this month in Florida, ''Why aren't I 50 points ahead, you might ask?'' the \uc2 Trump\uc2  campaign quickly offered an answer in a new ad featuring a list of grievances. ''Maybe it's because the director of the F.B.I. said you lied about your emails,'' a narrator says. ''Or maybe it's because you call Americans 'deplorable,''' he continues, as the now infamous clip plays of Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  deriding some of the \uc2 Trump\uc2  supporters. The ad closes as it opened, and adds a rhetorical question: ''Do you really need to ask?''\par \par \uc2 Beer Politics\par \par \uc2 There's the ''\uc2 Trump\uc2  Wall,'' a towering 55-foot barricade of best-in-the-world concrete, and then there's the Tecate Beer Wall, waist high and the perfect place to rest an ice-cold, glistening brew. In a rare political ad from a commercial enterprise, Tecate poked fun at the central tenet of the \uc2 Trump\uc2  appeal, envisioning a wall that ''brings us together,'' described with Trumpian hyperbole, like ''tremendous'' and ''the best wall.'' Stretching for miles across a desert landscape, four men from Mexico and four men from California meet at the wall, sharing a cooler of beers and at one point hopping over from the California side to the Mexican. The ad concludes, ''This wall may be small, but it will be huge.''\par \par \uc2 Toilet Humor\par \par \uc2 Getting attention in a down-ballot local race can be tough, driving candidates to get more creative in their ad making. John DiSanto, a candidate for State Senate in Pennsylvania, went with not one, not two, but three toilet humor jokes in his new ad. ''As a businessman and farmer, I've had to deal with a lot of crap,'' he says, as a shot of him spearing manure with a pitchfork pans across the screen. Pivoting to his opponent, Mr. DiSanto comes right out with it, saying, ''He's spreading a lot of --'' before going to a bleeped-out, four-letter word. The ad then traces over his record, before going for one more joke: ''These career politicians produce a lot of manure, so it's good I've got some big equipment.''\par \par \uc2 Numbers\par \par \uc2 $18.4 million spent on the Florida Senate general \uc2 election\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 $56.8 million spent on the presidential \uc2 election\uc2  in Florida.\par \par \uc2 Find out what you need to know about the 2016 presidential race today, and get politics news updates via \uc2 Facebook\uc2 , \uc2 Twitter\uc2  and the First Draft newsletter.\par \par \uc2 Document NYTF000020161002eca200047\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw272\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4080\pichgoal600

\par\par \b \uc2 The Bridge Case: Bridge Defense Paints Witness As Christie Insider\b0\par\par\uc2 By Corinne Ramey \par \uc2 867 \uc2 words\par \uc2 1 October 2016\par \uc2 The Wall Street Journal\par \uc2 J\par A13\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 NEWARK -- Bridget Kelly, one of the defendants in the George Washington Bridge lane-closure trial, was barely mentioned on the day her lawyer got his first chance to question the admitted architect of the closures and the government's star witness.\par \par \uc2 And that appeared to be the point.\par \par \uc2 The attorney spent much of Friday painting witness \uc2 David Wildstein\uc2  as a political insider who sought to advance New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie's presidential ambitions, involved himself in campaign minutiae and shared inside jokes with the governor. The attorney, Michael Critchley, noted that Mr. Wildstein wanted to leave his job at the \uc2 Port Authority of New York and New Jersey\uc2  to work on the Republican governor's presidential campaign in New Hampshire or Iowa.\par \par \uc2 "Why did you pick Iowa and New Hampshire?" asked Mr. Critchley.\par \par \uc2 "Those were the two most important states," Mr. Wildstein said.\par \par \uc2 "You wanted to make sure you were there to prevent any stoppage to \uc2 Gov. Christie's\uc2  presidential campaign," the attorney said.\par \par \uc2 At the end of the trial's second week, Mr. Critchley explicitly portrayed Mr. Wildstein as part of \uc2 Mr. Christie's\uc2  inner circle and an influential political operative in the governor's campaign. His implicit argument: That his client, Ms. Kelly, was neither.\par \par \uc2 Ms. Kelly, a former deputy chief of staff to Mr. Christie, and \uc2 Bill Baroni\uc2  , former deputy executive director of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, are on trial for what prosecutors say was a scheme to create traffic jams in Fort Lee, N.J., to punish the borough's Democratic mayor for not endorsing Mr. Christie. The defendants, alongside Mr. Wildstein, allegedly did this by closing local-access lanes at the George Washington Bridge in September 2013. Mr. Wildstein has pleaded guilty and is testifying for the government.\par \par \uc2 In U.S. District Court in Newark on Friday, Mr. Critchley argued that Mr. Wildstein gave and received requests for advice to Bill Stepien, "one of the most significant people in Chris Christie's political life." Emails presented in court showed Mr. Wildstein providing advice on campaign appointments and discussing minutiae of political strategy with Mr. Stepien, a former aide who became Mr. Christie's campaign manager and now works for Republican presidential nominee \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  . Emails shown in court show Mr. Wildstein and Mr. Stepien discussing political matters from fundraising to endorsements.\par \par \uc2 "You're advising the campaign manager what he should be thinking about?" Mr. Critchley said.\par \par \uc2 "I'm putting it on his radar screen," Mr. Wildstein replied.\par \par \uc2 In other correspondence, Mr. Wildstein offered to use \uc2 Port Authority\uc2  resources to support the governor's potential presidential bid. Mr. Wildstein, using his Gmail account, wrote to the \uc2 Yahoo\uc2  account of Mr. Stepien.\par \par \uc2 "Just to be clear, at some point hundreds of flags flown over the WTC will find their way to VFWs all through Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina," Mr. Wildstein wrote on Sept. 8, 2013, using abbreviations for the World Trade Center and the \uc2 Veterans of Foreign Wars\uc2  service organization.\par \par \uc2 Most of the emails regarding the presidential campaign shown in court were from before \uc2 Mr. Christie's\uc2  2013 gubernatorial re-\uc2 election\uc2 , and many from August 2013, during the time Mr. Wildstein was planning the lane closures. In some, Mr. Critchley argued, Mr. Wildstein took credit for \uc2 Port Authority\uc2  public-employee union endorsements, to impress those close to the governor.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Critchley also sought to establish that Mr. Wildstein was close enough to the governor that they had personal conversations and inside jokes. In one instance, he said Mr. Wildstein, Mr. Baroni and Mr. Christie had a discussion at the October 2012 wedding of Mr. Christie's former press secretary. The attorney asked what they had talked about it.\par \par \uc2 "I said to Gov. Christie that if you get elected president, I wanted to lay claim to the ambassador of Anguilla," Mr. Wildstein said he told the governor at the wedding. All three men laughed, he added.\par \par \uc2 This was a joke, the witness said, and he never specified what role he sought in a Christie administration.\par \par \uc2 After the lane closures and their alleged punitive purpose became public, Mr. Christie sought to distance himself from Mr. Wildstein.\par \par \uc2 In 2014, for instance, Mr. Christie said he couldn't recall his most recent meeting with Mr. Wildstein. He also played down the fact that they attended the same high school, saying they had moved in different circles.\par \par \uc2 During one of the more unusual exchanges of the day, Mr. Critchley projected a 2013 photo of the governor and Mr. Wildstein surrounded by others, including Mr. Baroni, former Port Authority Chairman David Samson and William "Pat" Schuber, a Port Authority commissioner. Mr. Christie appeared to have his arm around Mr. Wildstein, and the two appeared to be gazing longingly into each other's eyes. Mr. Wildstein said he remembered the photo well because people teased him about it, and said there was an "adoring look" on both their faces.\par \par \uc2 "Who was more adoring?" Mr. Critchley asked to chuckles from the packed courtroom.\par \par \uc2 "I suppose you'd have to ask Gov. Christie that," the witness said.\par \par \uc2 ---\par \par \uc2 Ted Mann contributed to this article.\par \par \uc2 Document J000000020161001eca10003i\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw272\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4080\pichgoal600

\par\par \b \uc2 Election\uc2  2016: Missouri Senate Race Tightens as Democrat Gains\b0\par\par\uc2 By Will Connors and Siobhan Hughes \par \uc2 621 \uc2 words\par \uc2 1 October 2016\par \uc2 The Wall Street Journal\par \uc2 J\par A4\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 ST. LOUIS -- Fueled by tightening polls and a TV ad in which he assembles an AR-15 rifle blindfolded, Missouri Democratic Senate candidate Jason Kander is newly confident he can unseat incumbent \uc2 Sen. Roy Blunt\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 The suddenly close race has both Democratic and Republican groups outside the state pouring money into this onetime GOP stronghold as it becomes an increasingly competitive battleground in the fight for control of the \uc2 U.S. Senate\uc2  .\par \par \uc2 After trailing Mr. Blunt in polls since the start of the race, the 35-year-old \uc2 Missouri secretary of state\uc2  came in ahead by two points in a recent poll by \uc2 Emerson College\uc2  . Mr. Kander still trails in most polls, but the Cook Political Report on Friday moved the race from leans-Republican to a toss-up.\par \par \uc2 As Democrats' prospects of winning Senate races have dimmed in Ohio and Florida, party leaders are increasingly putting their energy into places like Missouri, conservative-leaning states where they sense the incumbent has weaknesses.\par \par \uc2 Democrats need to win a net of five seats to regain control of the Senate -- or four if \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  is elected president -- and are confident of ousting Republicans in only Illinois and Wisconsin. A race in Indiana, which was once seen as a lock for Democrats, is now looking more like a toss-up.\par \par \uc2 Here in Missouri, the Senate Democrats' campaign arm in September reserved an additional $2 million of advertisements, bringing its total to $3.5 million.\par \par \uc2 The question is whether a telegenic candidate and a climate that favors outsiders will be enough for Mr. Kander to overcome his relatively low profile, a conservative voting bloc and GOP efforts to define him as an ally of Democratic presidential candidate Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , who is trailing in the state.\par \par \uc2 The Senate Republicans' campaign arm fired back recently with its first television advertisement as part of a campaign that totals at least $1 million so far. Outside groups are also spending heavily to help shore up Mr. Blunt, including the \uc2 National Rifle Association\uc2  .\par \par \uc2 Mr. Kander's national profile got a jolt from a TV ad released last month that shows the former Army captain, who served in Afghanistan, assembling an AR-15 assault rifle blindfolded. He then challenges Mr. Blunt to do the same.\par \par \uc2 "The momentum is really clearly with us," Mr. Kander, a Georgetown Law School graduate who served a term as a state legislator before being elected secretary of state, said at a small but lively campaign event in St. Louis on Saturday.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Blunt has portrayed Mr. Kander as being soft on gun rights in a state that recently dropped requirements that residents take a class and pass a background check to carry a concealed weapon.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Kander says he respects the Second Amendment but is in favor of background checks for gun buyers.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Blunt, 66, recently responded with an ad in which he said many people can assemble a rifle blindfolded, but "only one" is a national campaign chairman for Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Mr. Blunt declined to comment on Mr. Kander's ad but said he was doing what he needed to win the race. The first-term Republican senator, who served seven terms as a congressman, has a reputation as an inside player who knows how to reach critical spending deals.\par \par \uc2 Missourians on both sides say the race is far from over.\par \par \uc2 "Obviously, Sen. Blunt is not showing great strength in the polls, but he tends to be a survivor and win close elections," said Kenneth Warren, professor of political science at Saint Louis University. Dr. Warren thinks Mr. Kander's military history will play well with Missouri voters.\par \par \uc2 Document J000000020161001eca100042\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw272\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4080\pichgoal600

\par\par \b \uc2 Election\uc2  2016: Unmarried Voters Have Numbers, Not Attention\b0\par\par\uc2 By Janet Adamy   \par \uc2 598 \uc2 words\par \uc2 1 October 2016\par \uc2 The Wall Street Journal\par \uc2 J\par A5\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 Michael Cuellar isn't moved when presidential candidates talk about aiding middle-class families and offering child-care tax breaks. Such perks wouldn't help the 27-year-old Austin, Texas, startup worker, who plans to remain a childless bachelor for years.\par \par \uc2 He is part of what sociologists see as a growing disconnect between the messaging of political campaigns and a dramatically changing U.S. electorate. Nearly half of adults in America are unmarried, while the rate is even higher among those under age 35, now the largest of all potential voting blocs. But while candidates up and down the ballot seek support from younger voters, they still aim their stump speeches largely at nuclear families.\par \par \uc2 This year, 48% of eligible voters are unmarried, up from 30% in 1974, census figures show. The 2016 presidential race will be the first one where there are more unmarried women eligible to vote than married women, according to \uc2 Brookings Institution\uc2  demographer William Frey.\par \par \uc2 Young adults are waiting longer to wed, and the share that live with their parents is at its highest level in modern history. In all, among the largest single U.S. voting bloc, 77% of millennial males and 70% of females have never married.\par \par \uc2 Meanwhile, Baby Boomers who divorced or are widowed feel less societal pressure to remarry, and more couples live together outside of marriage.\par \par \uc2 "You see candidates talk to voters as if everyone's married with children and living in intact families," said Eric Klinenberg, professor of sociology at New York University and the author of "Going Solo: The Extraordinary Rise and Surprising Appeal of Living Alone." He added, "Clearly the 'Father Knows Best' rhetoric doesn't work for 21st Century American voters."\par \par \uc2 Single adults are hardly a monolithic group. About 13%, are raising a child younger than 18, according to census figures from \uc2 Pew Research Center\uc2 . Others prefer to be single or have no plans to have children. Still others are older and widowed, and for them, benefit programs like Medicare and Social Security hold outsize importance.\par \par \uc2 Part of the reason politicians give single adults less attention is because they vote at lower rates. Political strategists say they also move more frequently, making registration a bigger hurdle. They vote for Democrats more than their married counterparts, in part because they are often economically insecure, said Democratic pollster \uc2 Anna Greenberg\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Democratic strategists see increasing turnout among unmarried women as particularly important to nominee \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 . Polling by Greenberg Quinlan Rosner Research after Monday'sdebate showed white unmarried women were among the most drawn to Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , thanks to her remarks on expanding paid family leave and tightening gun laws.\par \par \uc2 A Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll in September found that among unmarried women, 57% backed Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  and 29% backed Republican \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2 . Unmarried men leaned toward Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , 48% versus 41% planning to vote for Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Some lawmakers are tweaking their stump speeches to appeal to unhitched voters. Rep. Eric Swalwell (D., Calif.) says he sees student debt holding back his constituents from starting their own families. When he first ran for his seat four years ago as a single 31-year-old, his opponent swiped at him in a debate for not having a family.\par \par \uc2 "I felt a little embarrassed about it," said Mr. Swalwell. He doesn't think the barb ultimately resonated. "If it worked a long time ago, I certainly don't think it works now."\par \par \uc2 ---\par \par \uc2 Paul Overberg contributed to this article.\par \par {\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw380\pich364\picscaley75\picscalex75\picwgoal7600\pichgoal7280

\par\par \b \uc2 Election\uc2  2016: GOP State-Level Dominance Faces Test --- Democrats see chance to reduce Republicans' recent ascendancy in legislatures\b0\par\par\uc2 By Beth Reinhard   \par \uc2 782 \uc2 words\par \uc2 1 October 2016\par \uc2 The Wall Street Journal\par \uc2 J\par A4\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 The Republican Party, after seizing control of more state legislative chambers than at any time in its history, is playing more defense in the 2016 \uc2 election\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 The GOP won a majority of legislatures in 2010 and expanded to a record number after the 2014 \uc2 election\uc2 , with Republicans running both chambers in 30 states and one of the chambers in another nine.\par \par \uc2 And while the party was shut out of the White House, and Congress sat mostly gridlocked, those Republican state lawmakers implemented conservative agendas across the country. They cut taxes, restricted access to abortion, made it easier to buy and carry guns, curbed the clout of labor unions and expanded educational options outside the public schools.\par \par \uc2 Some of those political and policy shifts now hang in the balance as Democrats build an oversize voter turnout operation to help presidential nominee \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  in swing states such as Colorado and New Hampshire -- where GOP state legislative majorities are at risk.\par \par \uc2 Thirteen of the 18 chambers most likely to see the opposition party win control are held by Republicans, according to the nonpartisan National Conference of State Legislatures, which tracks state-level races.\par \par \uc2 Among majorities in play are state Senates in Washington, West Virginia, Colorado and Nevada, which could flip to Democratic control with just one seat change. Republicans are also defending narrow House majorities in Minnesota, New Hampshire and New Mexico, where polls show Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  leading Republican rival \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 "When you are at a number that you have never before hit in history, you naturally have more ground to defend," said Matt Walter, president of the Republican State Leadership Committee.\par \par \uc2 The arm of the Democratic Party that oversees state legislative races is predicting takeovers in 8 to 12 chambers.\par \par \uc2 "It's really a year of opportunity for the Democrats, given the success Republicans have had in the last several \uc2 election\uc2  cycles," said NCSL director Tim Storey.\par \par \uc2 The 69 GOP-controlled chambers out of 99 nationwide includes the unicameral Nebraska Legislature, which is nonpartisan but leans Republican, and the New York Senate, where some members of the Democratic majority are allied with the GOP and a Republican leads the chamber.\par \par \uc2 In this year's elections, running down-ballot from two of the most disliked presidential nominees has prompted many GOP and Democratic candidates to keep their distance from the top of their tickets.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Walter played down the influence of the presidential nominee on down-ballot races, noting Republicans control 23 chambers in states won twice by President \uc2 Barack Obama\uc2 , like Florida and Pennsylvania.\par \par \uc2 Many Democrats are trying to yoke their Republican rivals to the Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's controversial rhetoric about women, minorities and immigrants. In Nevada, where polls show a tight presidential race, Democratic state Senate candidate Devon Reese has criticized GOP opponent Heidi Gansert for backing Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 . They are competing in a Reno-based swing district that is 18% Hispanic and 7% black and Asian.\par \par \uc2 Ms. Gansert, a former state assemblywoman, said publicly she would support Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  after he essentially clinched the nomination in May. But she said she hasn't offered an endorsement or campaigned on his behalf and is unsure if she will ultimately vote for him.\par \par \uc2 "I have been focusing on my own campaign, and I think it's important that voters see that," said Ms. Gansert.\par \par \uc2 Both parties are looking ahead to 2020, when states will redraw legislative districts based on population changes recorded by the U.S. Census. After the Republican wave of 2010, the GOP controlled the redistricting process in many states, allowing it to defend and expand its new majorities.\par \par \uc2 Democratic Party leaders are seeking to offset those advantages with a stronger turnout operation, supplemented by the \uc2 Clinton\uc2  campaign. The nominee has hundreds more staffers and campaign offices than Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 The ascendance of the GOP instatecapitols predates Mr. Obama's \uc2 election\uc2  in 2008, as a Republican tide washed over Southern states dominated by Democrats for decades.\par \par \uc2 The RSLC credits its success in the past few years in part to efforts to recruit female and minority candidates, helping to elect 229 women and 73 people of color. The group spent $11 million since the 2012 \uc2 election\uc2  and plans to spend another $7 million this cycle on leading GOP candidates.\par \par \uc2 The Kentucky House is the only chamber in the South currently run by Democrats, making the party's six-seat advantage there a top target for Republicans. The GOP is also eyeing thin Democratic majorities in the Iowa Senate and the Washington House.\par \par {\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw380\pich342\picscaley75\picscalex75\picwgoal7600\pichgoal6840

\par\par \uc2 CONTRIBUTING OP-ED WRITER\par \uc2 Editorial Desk; SECTA\par \b \uc2 The Fat-Shamer in Chief\b0\par\par\uc2 By TIMOTHY EGAN \par \uc2 896 \uc2 words\par \uc2 1 October 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 19\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Apparently, millions of Americans don't care that a man now within a nose-hair of the presidency may be the most prolific liar in modern political history. Nor do they care about the authoritarian policies he espouses, his truly scary embrace of dictators abroad and crackpots at home, or his monumental ignorance on every subject.\par \par \uc2 But as the impact of this week's debate and the after-chatter have settled in, it's clear that blood can boil across the land on at least one topic: We care about appearances. With little more than a month to go until the \uc2 election\uc2 , the fact that \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  now finds himself in a very public fight with a beauty queen tells you everything you need to know about the sick soul of this man.\par \par \uc2 So, in the spirit of the discourse that \uc2 Trump\uc2  has brought us to, let's objectify the Republican nominee on his terms. This guy is fat. Bigly. He's got an extra chin, a gut you wouldn't want to see riding above a bathing suit, and a rear that serves no purpose but ballast.\par \par \uc2 At 6-foot-2, the height that he has long given profile writers, \uc2 Trump\uc2  weighs 236 pounds, he told Dr. Oz. Not quite Taftian -- he ballooned to 354 pounds by his inauguration in 1909 -- but not healthy, either. By government guidelines, \uc2 Trump\uc2  is obese. In a weasel move to avoid that classification, \uc2 Trump\uc2  now says he is 6-foot-3, which makes him merely overweight. How he grew an inch, at the age of 70, is a story that has escaped his hagiographers at Fox.\par \par \uc2 Trump\uc2 's ducktail hairdo, colored in a hue unknown to nature, is a complicated comb-over inspired by Dr. Seuss. He wears a silly cap at outdoor rallies to keep the nest in place. It makes him look like ''the warm-up guy,'' Garrison Keillor wrote, ''the guy who announces the license number of the car left in the parking lot, doors locked, lights on, motor running.''\par \par \uc2 His fingers, as Spy magazine first noted decades ago, are unusually short. At 7.25 inches from the tip of his middle finger to the wrist (according to sleuthing by investigative reporters), \uc2 Trump\uc2 's hands are smaller than 85 percent of American men. No surprise he lies about that as well. ''Look at these hands,'' he said during a debate earlier this year, holding the dwarf-size digits up for all to see. ''Are they small hands?''\par \par \uc2 I bring all this up because \uc2 Trump\uc2  brings it up -- constantly. For someone who is fat, short-fingered and strange-looking, he is obsessed with looks. During his decades in the spotlight, he has bullied and shamed women for their weight. And more -- he has had people fired, at his golf courses, for not being pretty enough, The \uc2 Los Angeles Times\uc2  reported this week.\par \par \uc2 In the days after the most watched political debate in history, \uc2 Trump\uc2  didn't talk about trade policy, war and peace, or health care. Instead, his fetish for the superficial dominated his talking points, trying to fat-shame anew the former Miss Universe, Alicia Machado. \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  baited him for calling the young woman ''Miss Piggy'' and ''Miss Housekeeping.'' Machado is getting her revenge.\par \par \uc2 Trump\uc2  ''always treated me like a lesser thing, like garbage,'' she told reporters on a conference call. \uc2 Trump\uc2  surrogate Newt Gingrich, another guy you wouldn't want to be seated next to in a cramped row of a commuter plane, explained that beauty queens should not be fat. Fair point. But nor should beauty queens be so belittled, as Machado said, that the insults triggered a relapse in her bulimia.\par \par \uc2 You certainly shouldn't have to be height-weight perfect to work at a golf course. But a catering director at a California course said under oath that she was told to fire an employee ''because Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  doesn't like fat people,'' according to a 2012 deposition.\par \par \uc2 Trump\uc2  also revealed his apparent obsession with the obese in dismissing Russian sabotage of the \uc2 election\uc2 . More likely, he said during the debate, ''it could be someone sitting on their bed that weighs 400 pounds,'' giving techies a great hashtag to play with on Twitter.\par \par \uc2 This fat-shaming episode by a man who wants to lead the country is deeply resonant because most Americans struggle with their weight. More than two-thirds of adults are overweight or obese. It's a serious problem -- life threatening, for many people -- with multibillion dollar health care consequences.\par \par \uc2 Trump\uc2  could express sympathy or offer some solutions. Instead, he stuffs his puffy face with junk food for the cameras, while making fun of anyone who isn't a cover model. As for exercise, he burns most of his calories by giving speeches, he says. Seriously. Aerobic insults, the \uc2 Trump\uc2  diet.\par \par \uc2 ''Fat, drunk and stupid is no way to go through life,'' Dean Wormer told a pledge in ''Animal House.'' \uc2 Trump\uc2  would certainly agree, even though he has two of the three attributes. A look in the mirror would give him more than enough to talk about.\par \par \uc2 I invite you to follow me on Twitter (@nytegan).\par \par \uc2 Follow The \uc2 New York Times\uc2  Opinion section on \uc2 Facebook\uc2  and Twitter (@NYTopinion), and sign up for the Opinion Today newsletter.\par \par \uc2 Document NYTF000020161001eca10006l\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 National Desk; SECTA\par \b \uc2 Clintons' Marriage Is \uc2 Trump\uc2 's New Line of Attack\b0\par\par\uc2 By PATRICK HEALY and MAGGIE HABERMAN \par \uc2 1,411 \uc2 words\par \uc2 1 October 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 10\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2  unleashed a slashing new attack on \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  over \uc2 Bill \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's sexual indiscretions on Friday as he sought to put the Clintons' relationship at the center of his political argument against her before their next debate.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , aiming to unnerve Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , even indicated that he was rethinking his statement at their last debate that he would ''absolutely'' support her if she won in November, saying: ''We're going to have to see. We're going to see what happens. We're going to have to see.''\par \par \uc2 In an interview with The \uc2 New York Times\uc2 , he also contended that infidelity was ''never a problem'' during his three marriages, though his first ended in an ugly divorce after Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  began a relationship with the woman who became his second wife.\par \par \uc2 Speaking by phone from a campaign swing in Michigan, he said that he was ''absolutely disgusted'' that Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  had allied herself politically with a Miss Universe winner, Alicia Machado, whom Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  had derided for gaining weight.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  said that Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , who has portrayed Ms. Machado as a victim of Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's cruel insults, had ''made this young lady into a girl scout when she was the exact opposite.'' He asserted, without offering any evidence, that Ms. Machado had once participated in a sex tape.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , the Republican presidential nominee, argued that Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's support for Ms. Machado was part of a pattern by the Democrat of treating women to suit her own political ends, and raised Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's criticism of women who had been involved with her husband, such as Monica Lewinsky and Gennifer Flowers.\par \par \uc2 He said he was bringing up Mr. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's infidelities because he thought they would repulse female voters and turn them away from the Clintons, and because he was eager to unsettle Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  in their next two debates and on the campaign trail.\par \par \uc2 ''She's nasty, but I can be nastier than she ever can be,'' Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  said.\par \par \uc2 ''\uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  was married to the single greatest abuser of women in the history of politics,'' he added about Mr. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 . ''Hillary was an enabler, and she attacked the women who \uc2 Bill \uc2 Clinton\uc2  mistreated afterward. I think it's a serious problem for them, and it's something that I'm considering talking about more in the near future.''\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  said he believed that his own marital history did not preclude him from waging such an attack. He became involved with Marla Maples while he was still married to his first wife, Ivana, who divorced him in 1991. He married Ms. Maples in 1993; they were divorced in 1999. He married his current wife, Melania, in 2005.\par \par \uc2 While Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  has bragged about his sexual exploits over the years, he charged in the interview that Mr. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  had numerous indiscretions that ''brought shame onto the presidency, and \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  was there defending him all along.''\par \par \uc2 But when asked if he had ever cheated on his wives, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  said: ''No -- I never discuss it. I never discuss it. It was never a problem.''\par \par \uc2 Asked specifically about his affair with Ms. Maples when he was married to Ivana \uc2 Trump\uc2 , Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  said: ''I don't talk about it. I wasn't president of the United States. I don't talk about it. When you think of the fact that he was impeached, the country was in turmoil, turmoil, absolute turmoil. He lied with Monica Lewinsky and paid a massive penalty.''\par \par \uc2 A \uc2 Clinton\uc2  campaign spokesman on Friday night described Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  as ''unhinged'' in his attacks on Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  over Ms. Machado. ''As Hillary has said, \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  can say whatever he wants about her, but she will not be bullied out of defending Alicia and the many other women \uc2 Trump\uc2  has attacked and demeaned,'' said the campaign spokesman, Brian Fallon.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's sharply negative attacks on the Clintons, and on Ms. Machado, pose a significant political risk to his own appeal: Two-thirds of voters already see him unfavorably, according to polls, and he is struggling to win over female voters -- including white women, a majority of whom have historically supported the Republican candidate in presidential elections.\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 Clinton\uc2  campaign is running a new attack ad against Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  featuring his insults of women over the years and has aggressively defended Ms. Machado; Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  called her on Friday to offer thanks ''for all she had done and the courage she has shown, particularly as this became elevated through a war of some pretty unpleasant words,'' according to Nick Merrill, a campaign spokesman.\par \par \uc2 But Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  is also scrambling for ways to rebound from his widely panned performance in the first general-\uc2 election\uc2  debate on Monday, when he frequently interrupted Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  and failed to raise issues that he wanted to discuss, like her ties to wealthy donors to the \uc2 Clinton\uc2  Foundation\uc2  and the attacks on the American diplomatic compound in Benghazi, Libya.\par \par \uc2 Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's team, Democrats supporting her and many senior Republicans have braced for an attack on the Clintons' marital history, seeing it as inevitable -- particularly now that Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  is being advised by several people connected to efforts in the late 1990s to reveal Mr. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's affair with Ms. Lewinsky and to the subsequent impeachment battle.\par \par \uc2 David Bossie\uc2 , Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's deputy campaign manager, is the president of the conservative group \uc2 Citizens United\uc2 , and worked as an investigator who searched Arkansas for evidence of Mr. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's personal misdeeds during the 1992 presidential campaign.\par \par \uc2 Some of Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's advisers have tried to suggest focusing on accusations that Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  tried to discredit women who said they had been harassed by Mr. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 . Chief among those suggesting this approach is Roger Stone, the longest-serving \uc2 Trump\uc2  adviser, who wrote a book called ''The Clintons' War on Women,'' laying out accusations from Juanita Broaddrick and Kathleen Willey, who have accused Mr. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  of sexual assault -- accusations the Clintons or their lawyer David Kendall have denied.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , however, has struggled to articulate that concept, and around 5 a.m. Friday he released a series of posts on \uc2 Twitter\uc2  attacking Ms. Machado once again.\par \par \uc2 In the interview Friday afternoon, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  said he would begin preparing as soon as this weekend for the next debate, on Oct. 9, and would be plotting ways to attack Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  on policy issues like trade and national security, as well as to unnerve her with possible targets like her husband's past.\par \par \uc2 As for his own vulnerabilities, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  insisted that he did not think he bungled a question at his first debate about not releasing his tax returns, when he argued at one point that he was ''smart'' to have avoided paying any federal income tax earlier in his career. ''I started getting such negative and unfair questions,'' Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  complained.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  said that he did pay some federal income tax last year, but declined to specify the amount, and continued to cite a federal audit as an excuse not to release his tax returns. People are free to release returns when they are under audit, and most presidential candidates have released their returns since the 1970s.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  said he did not think he needed to prepare more rigorously for the next debate than he did for the first one, because any shortcomings on Monday, he argued, were because of a problem with the microphone at his lectern, which he ''spent 50 percent of my thought process'' dealing with. The \uc2 Commission on Presidential Debates\uc2 , which sponsors the events, said on Friday that there were ''issues'' with Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's audio.\par \par \uc2 Looking broadly at the race, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  said he was pleased that he was running close to Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  in many polls and expressed optimism that he would prevail in Ohio and Florida and ultimately take the presidency.\par \par \uc2 ''I have the issues on my side,'' he said bullishly, ''and I have \uc2 Trump\uc2 , which I'll take.''\par \par \uc2 Find out what you need to know about the 2016 presidential race today, and get politics news updates via \uc2 Facebook\uc2 , \uc2 Twitter\uc2  and the First Draft newsletter.\par \par \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2  on Friday in the Oval Office replica at the Gerald R.

\par\par \uc2 National Desk; SECTA\par \b \uc2 At All Hours, \uc2 Trump\uc2  Wakens a Twitter Fury\b0\par\par\uc2 By MICHAEL BARBARO, MAGGIE HABERMAN and ALAN RAPPEPORT; Patrick Healy and Thomas Kaplan contributed reporting. \par \uc2 1,191 \uc2 words\par \uc2 1 October 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 1\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 The tweets started around 3:20 a.m. on Friday. Inside \uc2 Trump\uc2  Tower, a restless figure stirred in the predawn darkness, nursing his grievances and grabbing a device that often lands him in hot water.\par \par \uc2 On his Android phone, \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2  began to tap out bursts of digital fury: He mocked Alicia Machado, a former Miss Universe and a popular Latin American actress, as a ''con,'' the ''worst'' and ''disgusting.''\par \par \uc2 In a final flourish, before the sun came up, the Republican presidential nominee claimed -- without offering any evidence -- that she had appeared in a ''sex tape.''\par \par \uc2 The tirade fit a pattern. It is when Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  is alone with his thoughts, and untethered from his campaign staff, that he has seemed to commit his most self-destructive acts.\par \par \uc2 ''There has always been this dangerous part of him that will go too far and do something that backfires,'' said Michael D'Antonio, the author of ''The Truth About \uc2 Trump\uc2 ,'' a new biography of the real estate mogul.\par \par \uc2 ''His worst impulses,'' he added, ''are self-defeating.''\par \par \uc2 Over the past few days, those instincts have been on vivid display. In quick succession, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  has repeated his critique that Ms. Machado gained a ''massive amount of weight'' after she won the Miss Universe crown in 1996; suggested that former President \uc2 Bill \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's infidelities are fair game for campaign attacks; and urged his followers to ''check out'' a sex tape that may not exist. (Ms. Machado appeared in a risqu\u233\'00\'E9 scene on a reality television show, but fact-checkers have discovered no sex tape.)\par \par \uc2 The eruptions could further damage Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's reputation with women and Latino voters at a time when he can scarcely afford to alienate either group, five and half weeks before \uc2 Election\uc2  Day.\par \par \uc2 Yet for close students of Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's career and campaign, it all has a familiar ring. Over the years, he has issued a stream of needlessly cruel and seemingly off-the-cuff insults -- both on and off social media -- that have inflamed the public. He declared on \uc2 Twitter\uc2  that Kim Novak, a reclusive 81-year-old actress at the time, ''should sue her plastic surgeon,'' sending her into hiding. He derided the appearance of a rival, Carly Fiorina, angering female voters by asking: ''Can you imagine that, the face of our next president?'' And he criticized the mother of a slain American soldier, musing that as a Muslim woman, she was not ''allowed'' to speak.\par \par \uc2 Such fulminations have almost always arisen from Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's wounded pride, after he has been attacked or has suffered a setback. And they have frequently played out on \uc2 Twitter\uc2 , at hours of the day when much of America is asleep.\par \par \uc2 The early-morning tweets about Ms. Machado were a reminder, said the Republican strategist Charles Black, that Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  ''cannot let something drop until he proves he's right, and it's beside the point who's right.''\par \par \uc2 Around midnight one night during the primary campaign, he posted an unflattering photo of Heidi Cruz, the wife of a Republican rival, Senator Ted Cruz of Texas. Early one morning, he alleged a sexual affair between two well-known television anchors who had criticized him. Early one Saturday, he distributed an image of Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , surrounded by falling cash and a six-pointed star that many said was a Star of David and was anti-Semitic. And at 11 one evening, he shared a digitally altered image of Jeb Bush appearing to pick his nose.\par \par \uc2 ''Late night \uc2 Twitter\uc2 -drunk Donald is back at it!'' an aide to Mr. Bush replied at the time.\par \par \uc2 On Friday, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  was at it again between 3:20 and 5:30 a.m., issuing a series of indignant messages that mocked Ms. Machado and Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , who raised the experience of the former beauty queen to hurt Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  during the debate.\par \par \uc2 Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , he wrote ''was duped and used by my worst Miss U. Hillary floated her as an ''angel'' without checking her past, which is terrible!''\par \par \uc2 A few minutes later, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  theorized -- again, without offering any evidence -- that Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  had helped Ms. Machado become a United States citizen so that the Democratic nominee could mention the beauty queen in the debate to hurt Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , in an interview on Friday afternoon, said he remained proud of his tweets.\par \par \uc2 ''Why would I have regrets? I'm a very truthful person, and I'm telling the truth. Now people understand it. And before the tweets, people didn't understand it.''\par \par \uc2 It is unusual for a major party presidential nominee to directly control any online communications, let alone issue provocative, unsubstantiated claims without the filter of a campaign aide.\par \par \uc2 But Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  is fixated on \uc2 Twitter\uc2 . He has nearly 12 million followers and has reveled in watching his stray thoughts become viral sensations on the social media platform. He has been fond of quoting a fan on \uc2 Twitter\uc2 , who described him as ''the Ernest Hemingway of a hundred and forty characters.''\par \par \uc2 So like a car careening down a highway with no guardrails, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  on Friday sent out one message after another. His suggestion of a sex tape featuring Ms. Machado sent his most zealous followers hunting for images. A few of them posted pornographic images of women who they believe resembled Ms. Machado.\par \par \uc2 Ms. Machado on Friday called Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's online assault ''cheap lies with bad intentions'' and said that she would not be intimidated.\par \par \uc2 Aides to Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , who have long warned of his reckless ways on \uc2 Twitter\uc2 , said Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's behavior had once again bolstered their argument that he is mentally unfit for the presidency.\par \par \uc2 ''I mean, his latest \uc2 Twitter\uc2  meltdown is unhinged, even for him,'' Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  said on Friday.\par \par \uc2 ''Really, who gets up at 3 o'clock in the morning to engage in a \uc2 Twitter\uc2  attack against a former Miss Universe?'' she asked.\par \par \uc2 Many wondered aloud on Friday whether Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's erratic late-night behavior is the result of disorienting insomnia, since he regularly boasts of needing only a few hours of sleep. But Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  quickly rejected that theory.\par \par \uc2 ''For those few people knocking me for tweeting at three o'clock in the morning, at least you know I will be there, awake, to answer the call!'' Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  wrote on \uc2 Twitter\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Not everyone in his life seems so sure. Asked this year which habit she wished her husband would quit, Melania \uc2 Trump\uc2  gave a one-word answer: tweeting.\par \par \uc2 Find out what you need to know about the 2016 presidential race today, and get politics news updates via \uc2 Facebook\uc2 , \uc2 Twitter\uc2  and the First Draft newsletter.\par \par \uc2 In the predawn hours Friday, Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2  issued a string of tweets about Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  and a former Miss Universe.; Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  has nearly 12 million followers on Twitter, and has posted a number of messages in the middle of the night.

But this \uc2 election\uc2 , the Republican presidential nominee, \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , has captured many of those blue-collar voters' hearts, with his denunciation of trade deals and promises to bring back manufacturing.\par \par \uc2 Take a tour of signature Springsteen spots to see which are turning toward Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Youngstown, Ohio\par \par \uc2 Song: ''Youngstown''\par \par \uc2 Album: ''The Ghost of Tom Joad''\par \par \uc2 State of the race: Northeastern Ohio favors Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\par \par \uc2 ''Youngstown'' traces the long history of steel and iron production that has defined this working-class city.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  has visited Youngstown and made revival of the steel industry a focus of his campaign, pledging to rebuild American cities' infrastructure with steel produced in the United States. Still, he trails the Democratic nominee, \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , 46 percent to 33 percent, in northeastern Ohio, home to Youngstown and Cleveland, though he holds a slight edge statewide, according to a recent Suffolk University poll.\par \par \uc2 [Video: Bruce Springsteen: YOUNGSTOWN (live in Youngstown!)

In the 34 years since the song's release, the area has grown more distressed, largely because of the closings of casinos.\par \par \uc2 But Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  has little traction here; Atlantic County, home to Atlantic City, is more ethnically diverse and economically depressed than most of the Jersey Shore, and appears to be leaning Democratic again this year.\par \par \uc2 [Video: Bruce Springsteen - Atlantic City Watch on \uc2 YouTube\uc2 .]\par \par \uc2 _____\par \par \uc2 Badlands National Park, S.D.\par \par \uc2 Song: ''Badlands''\par \par \uc2 Album: ''Darkness on the Edge of Town''\par \par \uc2 In this song, the dry, craggy terrain of the badlands becomes a symbol of hard living and perseverance in the American West. Most of the badlands states, shaped by a frontier politics, vote reliably Republican, and Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  is ahead of Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  among likely voters here in the Dakotas and nearby Plains states, 43 percent to 36 percent, according to the most recent New York Times/CBS News poll.\par \par \uc2 But many young adults here have been energized by the Libertarian candidate, Gary Johnson, who is drawing 13 percent, which may prevent Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  from running up a big victory margin.\par \par \uc2 [Video: Bruce Springsteen - Badlands (Live Glastonbury 2009) Watch on \uc2 YouTube\uc2 .]\par \par \uc2 _____\par \par \uc2 Johnstown, Pa.\par \par \uc2 Song: ''The River''\par \par \uc2 Album: ''The River''\par \par \uc2 State of the race: Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  has an edge in southwestern Pennsylvania\par \par \uc2 The sense of malaise that Mr. Springsteen noted in blue-collar communities across America at the turn of the 1980s is still strongly felt in places like western Pennsylvania, where manufacturing jobs have largely vanished. White voters without a college degree are among Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's strongest supporters there, as they are nationwide: 56 percent of these likely voters support him in a two-way race, versus 37 percent for Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , according to this month's \uc2 Quinnipiac University\uc2  poll of Pennsylvania.\par \par \uc2 But Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  is making that up with support from nonwhites -- three-quarters of whom say they will vote for her -- and more educated white voters. The poll gives her a five-point advantage over Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  statewide.\par \par \uc2 [Video: Bruce Springsteen - The River (The River Tour, Tempe 1980) Watch on \uc2 YouTube\uc2 .]\par \par \uc2 _____\par \par \uc2 Amarillo, Tex.\par \par \uc2 Song: ''Cadillac Ranch''\par \par \uc2 Album: ''The River''\par \par \uc2 State of the race: Northwestern Texas favors Mr. \uc2 Trump\par \par \uc2 ''Cadillac Ranch'' is a carefree, borderline-nonsensical salute to one of Mr. Springsteen's favorite themes: the joys of a good, shiny sedan. It is also a homage to the famed tourist attraction in Amarillo.\par \par \uc2 The city's thriving economy revolves around meatpacking and defense contracting.\par \par \uc2 A recent Texas Lyceum poll shows Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  leading Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  by just six points in Texas, and if that holds, he would win the state by a narrower margin than any Republican candidate since \uc2 Bob Dole\uc2 . But his fate seems secure in Amarillo, which is in the state's northwestern quadrant, where no statewide Republican candidate since 2010 has taken less than 70 percent.\par \par \uc2 [Video: Bruce Springsteen - Cadillac Ranch - Live at CNE Grandstands '84 (Blu-ray) Watch on \uc2 YouTube\uc2 .]\par \par \uc2 _____\par \par \uc2 Darlington County, S.C.\par \par \uc2 Song: ''Darlington County''\par \par \uc2 Album: ''Born in the U.S.A.''\par \par \uc2 State of the race: South Carolina favors Mr. \uc2 Trump\par \par \uc2 Location:\par \par \uc2 ''Darlington County'' tells the lighthearted story of two men who have left New York City behind and are cruising down Interstate 95, searching for work -- presumably escaping some unsavory business back home.\par \par \uc2 The area is friendly to Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , who trounced the field in South Carolina, including in Darlington County, where he defeated Senator Ted Cruz of Texas by roughly 10 points. No reliable general \uc2 election\uc2  polls have been published in South Carolina, but Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  should coast to victory here. No Democratic presidential nominee has won the state since 1976, two \uc2 election\uc2  cycles before Mr. Springsteen recorded this song.\par \par \uc2 [Video: Bruce Springsteen - Darlington County live in Arnhem 2007 Watch on \uc2 YouTube\uc2 .]\par \par \uc2 _____\par \par \uc2 Charlotte County, Fla.\par \par \uc2 Song: ''Working on the Highway''\par \par \uc2 Album: ''Born in the U.S.A.''\par \par \uc2 State of the race: The Florida Gulf Coast favors Mr. \uc2 Trump\par \par \uc2 This song's narrator finds himself arrested and enlisted in a prison gang doing highway construction in Charlotte County, along Florida's Gulf Coast.\par \par \uc2 The area is a conservative stronghold dominated by retirees and white-collar professionals. Ninety percent of county residents are white, and white Floridians overwhelmingly favor \uc2 Trump\uc2 , according to a recent \uc2 Monmouth University\uc2  poll. A separate poll by CNN/ORC gave him a lead of 49 percent to 33 percent in the central Gulf Coast region.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  feels a special connection to Florida, which he calls his second home, and barely a week goes by that the candidate does not visit what his campaign considers one of the most important states in the general \uc2 election\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 [Video: Bruce Springsteen - Working on the Highway (best live video) Watch on \uc2 YouTube\uc2 .]\par \par \uc2 Find out what you need to know about the 2016 presidential race today, and get politics news updates via \uc2 Facebook\uc2 , \uc2 Twitter\uc2  and the First Draft newsletter.\par \par \uc2 Bruce Springsteen, troubadour of working-class whites.

\par\par \uc2 National Desk; SECTA\par \b \uc2 A Rocky Homecoming for a Democrat\b0\par\par\uc2 By JENNIFER STEINHAUER \par \uc2 1,260 \uc2 words\par \uc2 1 October 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 9\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 MUNCIE, Ind. -- For \uc2 Evan Bayh\uc2 , who spent a third of his life serving this state, Susan Brown is a harrowing figure.\par \par \uc2 ''I was going to vote for him because he's \uc2 Evan Bayh\uc2 . \uc2 Evan Bayh\uc2 !'' said Ms. Brown, 69, a Republican, who has fond memories of the Democrat who is seeking to take back his Senate seat after a more than five-year hiatus. ''But then I saw all those commercials about all the money he made when he left office, and I think I am for the other guy now.''\par \par \uc2 When Mr. Bayh, swimming in cash and latent ambition, decided in mid-July that he would take another run at his old job, Democrats were overjoyed.\par \par \uc2 They believed that Mr. Bayh, 60, whose two terms each as governor and senator were won mostly with ease, had turned a lost cause in a red state into a sure win. By collectively pushing former Representative Baron Hill, the (likely doomed) Democrat, out of the race and replacing him with Mr. Bayh, they instantly elevated the party's chances to take back the Senate.\par \par \uc2 But Republicans attacked as quickly and voraciously as a cougar whose dinner has been threatened. Over the last few months, conservative groups have buried Mr. Bayh in ads mocking his Senate retirement, questioning his ties to Indiana and criticizing his work as a consultant for a Washington lobbying firm.\par \par \uc2 In an \uc2 election\uc2  year in which many voters appear to be embracing outsider credentials over experience, Mr. Bayh could find that there are limits to the good will that voters will extend to a candidate with fraying connections to his home state.\par \par \uc2 Federal records show that nearly $6 million in media spending by outside groups has targeted Mr. Bayh since he got into the race, and groups have more ready to go next month. (Also unhelpful: Mr. Bayh flubbed his home address during an interview.)\par \par \uc2 What was initially expected to be a gaping lead over Representative Todd Young, a Republican, has recently been only in the single digits, according to a \uc2 Monmouth University\uc2  poll, jolting Democrats' confidence.\par \par \uc2 ''Yes, I'm surprised, but that's the \uc2 Citizens United\uc2  world we are living in,'' Mr. Bayh said in an interview in Indianapolis last weekend, referring to the Supreme Court ruling that removed many limits on political spending.\par \par \uc2 After his unexpected retirement in 2010 from the Senate, Mr. Bayh joined a Washington law and lobbying firm, \uc2 McGuireWoods\uc2 . Republicans have tried to paint him as a handmaiden of special interests, a charge he predictably rejects. ''I've missed public service since the day I retired from the Senate,'' Mr. Bayh said.\par \par \uc2 Indiana has a recent history of punishing once-popular politicians who they think have ''gone Washington.'' Former Senator Richard G. Lugar, one of the state's most respected political figures, was ousted in a primary in 2012 by a Tea Party challenger.\par \par \uc2 But Senator Dan Coats, a Republican whose retirement created the opening for Mr. Bayh, made a comeback in 2010 after his own revolving-door turn as a lobbyist. Mr. Coats noted that the climate this year seemed more hostile. ''It might matter more this year than ever,'' he said.\par \par \uc2 Others have found themselves going from beloved to spurned. Former Senator \uc2 Bob Kerrey\uc2  had been gone from Nebraska for nearly 20 years when he tried to return to the Senate in 2012, leaving his wife and child back in New York City as he faced bruising attacks.\par \par \uc2 ''By November, half the people thought I had never lived in Nebraska,'' said Mr. Kerrey, who was defeated and returned to New York as quickly as he had left. ''Republicans are better than Democrats are in doing that sort of thing. They did such a good job they probably saved my marriage.''\par \par \uc2 But Mr. Bayh enjoys many advantages that keep him as the front-runner in the race, Democrats and Republicans agree. The son of former Senator Birch Bayh, Mr. Bayh is part of a Midwestern political dynasty that spans generations of voters. A moderate who was long viewed as working well with Republicans, Mr. Bayh fits the state's self-image as almost defiantly sensible.\par \par \uc2 He is so closely associated with a wildly popular scholarship program he signed into law in 1990 that \uc2 Mike Pence\uc2 , the governor and now the running mate of \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , the Republican presidential nominee, helped ensure it was renamed in his honor.\par \par \uc2 ''I really love that program,'' said Ms. Brown, a retired teacher, as a warning of sorts to Mr. Young when she met him in a bakery here last Sunday. ''You should do something like that.'' (She also told Mr. Young, 44, that he was ''so good looking'' three times, and made a few smooching sounds for good measure.)\par \par \uc2 Mr. Bayh entered the race with nearly $10 million to spend against Mr. Young's $1.2 million, freeing Democrats, at first, to spend money on other races.\par \par \uc2 But Mr. Bayh, who served as the governor of Indiana from 1989 to 1997 and senator from 1999 to 2011, is facing some headwinds. Indiana, which has grown increasingly conservative over the last decade, is \uc2 Trump\uc2  country. Having Mr. Pence on the ticket, even though his popularity has waned, could further strengthen its performance here.\par \par \uc2 A state not known for ticket splitting may well do so for Mr. Bayh, but a state that suffered disproportionately in the last recession may not have as much love for the so-called insiders Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  has railed against all year, even as it recovers.\par \par \uc2 ''There may be a nostalgic sense for the way things were when \uc2 Evan Bayh\uc2  was in office,'' said John Schorg, the spokesman for the Indiana House Democrats. ''But keeping people thinking that the way it was is the way it's going to be is hard.''\par \par \uc2 Mr. Young has been greatly aided by Republican-aligned outside groups, but he said his campaign was working well before Mr. Bayh belatedly entered the race.\par \par \uc2 ''Our message was compelling before he got in the race,'' Mr. Young said in an interview here. ''I am not a career politician. I am a Marine with four kids who wants to make a difference.'' (He is also in his third term in the House.)\par \par \uc2 All of this has put Mr. Bayh on defense, even insisting he was not a lobbyist in an advertisement, and focusing heavily on the things he accomplished during his service here and in Washington, like reminding a large group of black voters at the Light of the World Christian Church in Indianapolis on Sunday about his scholarship program and his long ties to its current and former pastor.\par \par \uc2 He has turned the ''insider'' attack back on Mr. Young. ''If people are angry at Washington, he's been there and he has to be accountable for that,'' he said.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Bayh admits the race will probably be close, though, even as he vows to prevail. ''In this political year,'' he said, ''a lot of things can happen.''\par \par \uc2 Follow The \uc2 New York Times\uc2 's politics and Washington coverage on \uc2 Facebook\uc2  and \uc2 Twitter\uc2 , and sign up for the First Draft politics newsletter.\par \par \uc2 Follow Jennifer Steinhauer on Twitter @jestei.\par \par \uc2 Evan Bayh at Light of the World Christian Church in Indianapolis last Sunday.

\par\par \uc2 National Desk; SECTA\par \b \uc2 Democrats Are Raking In Money, Thanks to a Lawsuit by Republicans\b0\par\par\uc2 By NICHOLAS CONFESSORE and RACHEL SHOREY \par \uc2 1,298 \uc2 words\par \uc2 1 October 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 11\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Democrats denounced it as an assault on democracy and a sop to billionaires when the Supreme Court issued a ruling two years ago that loosened limits on campaign giving.\par \par \uc2 But \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  and Democratic Party leaders are now exploiting the decision, funneling tens of millions of dollars from their wealthiest donors into a handful of presidential swing states.\par \par \uc2 The flow of money, documented in \uc2 Federal \uc2 Election\uc2  Commission\uc2  reports, shows Democrats expanding their fund-raising advantage in the final phase of the presidential race, defying expectations at the beginning of the campaign that Republicans would dominate the money chase.\par \par \uc2 Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  and the Democrats are now outpacing Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  and the Republicans on every front, according to F.E.C. records: Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's campaign, her party and outside groups supporting her have raised almost twice as much as Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  and his allies.\par \par \uc2 The influx of cash and the new rules have allowed the national Democratic Party to overcome a cash shortage and provide Democrats in key states like Virginia and North Carolina with money for early voting drives, additional staff and canvassing aimed up and down the ticket.\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 Democratic National Committee\uc2  -- in debt and underfinanced a year ago -- has poured nearly $30 million into these key states through the beginning of September.\par \par \uc2 The funding was powered by a surge of six-figure contributions raised by Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  from the likes of James Cameron, the Hollywood director, and \uc2 George Soros\uc2 , the retired hedge fund manager, as well as several members of the billionaire Pritzker family.\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 Republican National Committee\uc2  has provided the states with just $11 million, limited by \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's difficulties in persuading the traditional Republican big-donor base to invest in his campaign.\par \par \uc2 ''In many ways, we are kind of used to the concept of building our own empire,'' said Matt Borges, the executive director of the Republican Party of Ohio, adding that he did not believe Ohio Republicans would be at a disadvantage come \uc2 Election\uc2  Day. ''I'll take whatever I can get.''\par \par \uc2 More than two-thirds of the Democrats' cash went to a dozen presidential battlegrounds critical to any \uc2 Clinton\uc2  victory. The biggest beneficiaries were Florida, which has taken in close to $3.5 million, and Pennsylvania and Ohio, which have each received more than $2 million.\par \par \uc2 In each of those states, the funds from the national party have made a difference, erasing deficits in federal contributions against the respective Republican state parties.\par \par \uc2 The money followed a legal but circuitous route turbocharged by the 2014 ruling in McCutcheon v. \uc2 Federal \uc2 Election\uc2  Commission\uc2 , which struck down Watergate-era limits on the combined amount one person could donate to all federal candidates and parties in an \uc2 election\uc2  cycle.\par \par \uc2 Like other candidates for federal office this year, Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  can accept only up to $5,400 from any one donor over the course of her campaign. But after the McCutcheon decision, Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  established an agreement last year with the Democratic Party under which she asked her wealthiest patrons to write checks in excess of $300,000, more than double the old limit, to the Hillary Victory Fund, an account made up of the national and state parties and the \uc2 Clinton\uc2  campaign.\par \par \uc2 That amount is a lump sum equal to the total contributions each donor is allowed to give to her campaign and the \uc2 Democratic National Committee\uc2 , along with $10,000 to each of the 38 state party organizations now participating in the arrangements.\par \par \uc2 Because there are no limits on how much money party committees can transfer to one another, most of the state parties have cycled their share back to the \uc2 Democratic National Committee\uc2 . The party then moved the cash into a smaller number of battleground states to prepare for \uc2 Election\uc2  Day.\par \par \uc2 The effect is a legal end-run around contribution limits, allowing wealthy donors to give far more than $5,400 to help Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  where she needs it the most.\par \par \uc2 ''If you're a party leader or a candidate who can attract big enough donors, it means contribution limits are for the little guy,'' said Ian Vandewalker, a counsel at the Brennan Center for Justice, which favors tighter controls on political money. ''The party leaders, the candidates who have a national name, significant amounts of their war chests are built from these big checks,'' he said.\par \par \uc2 The Democrats' unexpected advantage comes courtesy of a lawsuit filed in 2012 by the \uc2 Republican National Committee\uc2  and \uc2 Shaun McCutcheon\uc2 , an Alabama businessman.\par \par \uc2 While both parties have used joint fund-raising arrangements for years, the decision issued two years ago in the McCutcheon case made it easier to raise and concentrate even more money from the same small group of wealthy donors.\par \par \uc2 At the time, the Supreme Court's conservative majority rejected concerns that lifting the limit would make candidates more indebted to the biggest donors. During oral arguments, Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr. dismissed the idea that party leaders or candidates in different states would cooperate by sending their contributions elsewhere as ''wild hypotheticals.''\par \par \uc2 Democrats also castigated the court, arguing that it had paved the way for the wealthiest donors to further dominate campaign giving.\par \par \uc2 ''With the rate the Supreme Court is going, there will only be three or four people in the whole country that have to finance our entire political system,'' Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  said during an appearance in Oregon the week after the McCutcheon decision.\par \par \uc2 Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  was no doubt exaggerating for effect. Still, the actual numbers are striking: Just 250 donors have accounted for about $44 million in contributions to the Hillary Victory Fund during the last year.\par \par \uc2 Josh Schwerin, a spokesman for the \uc2 Clinton\uc2  campaign, said that Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  continued to support new restrictions on campaign money, but that the only way to achieve them was to elect more Democrats who shared her views.\par \par \uc2 ''\uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  has fought for campaign finance reform her entire career and, as president, will make it a priority to restore the role of everyday voters in elections,'' Mr. Schwerin said, ''but the stakes of this \uc2 election\uc2  are too high to unilaterally disarm.''\par \par \uc2 By contrast, the money raised by Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  and the Republicans, while robust, has been driven chiefly by small checks from his grass-roots supporters.\par \par \uc2 And the Republicans have not been as shrewd at maximizing whatever money Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's large-dollar fund-raisers have contributed. More of the Republican big-donor money is being directed into national party accounts that cannot be spent directly on the \uc2 election\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 And the committee for \uc2 Trump\uc2  Victory -- the collective account set up to receive big contributions for the state, national and \uc2 Trump\uc2  campaigns -- had shared virtually no cash with the state parties through June. A Republican spokeswoman declined to explain why.\par \par \uc2 Only one Republican state organization, the Republican Party of Pennsylvania, had received any cash through August, according to \uc2 Federal \uc2 Election\uc2  Commission\uc2  records. The amount was $1,050, to reimburse the party for tables and chairs.\par \par \uc2 In an interview, Mr. McCutcheon said he did not mind that his lawsuit was paying more dividends for Democrats this year.\par \par \uc2 ''I think a lot of those Democrats were just publicly saying it was a bad idea, but a lot of them were on board,'' he said.\par \par \uc2 ''I don't care what party wins or loses as long as it's a free speech system.''\par \par \uc2 Find out what you need to know about the 2016 presidential race today, and get politics news updates via \uc2 Facebook\uc2 , \uc2 Twitter\uc2  and the First Draft newsletter.\par \par \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  in Fort Pierce, Fla., on Friday.

\par\par \uc2 Politics; SECT\par \b \uc2 Polls Show Debate Performance Gave \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  a Lift\b0\par\par\uc2 By JONATHAN MARTIN \par \uc2 575 \uc2 words\par \uc2 1 October 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 The New York Times on the Web\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 CORRECTION APPENDEDHillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's strong debate performance has lifted her standing in a handful of battleground state polls, an indication that her first face-off against \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2  halted the surge he was enjoying for much of September.\par \par \uc2 A poll of Florida voters conducted entirely after Monday night's debate shows Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  receiving the support of 46 percent of likely voters, while Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  was garnering 42 percent. The survey, conducted by Mason-Dixon polling and research, indicated that Gary Johnson, the Libertarian Party nominee, was the preferred candidate of 7 percent of voters.\par \par \uc2 Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's strength in Florida, a state Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  almost certainly needs to win if he is to compile 270 electoral votes, owes to her advantage among women and overwhelming support among Hispanics and African-Americans, the poll showed.\par \par \uc2 A New York Times Upshot/Siena College poll of Florida voters before the debate indicated the race there was effectively tied.\par \par \uc2 In New Hampshire, a state that could prove crucial in a close race, Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  now has 42 percent support compared to Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's 35 percent, according to a new survey of likely voters from WBUR. Mr. Johnson is preferred among 13 percent of likely voters in the libertarian-leaning state, and Jill Stein, the Green Party nominee, is receiving support from 4 percent of the state's electorate.\par \par \uc2 While Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's lead is down significantly from WBUR's last survey, taken over the summer, it is notably higher than the NBC-Marist poll before the debate in September that indicated Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  was up by only a single point.\par \par \uc2 New Hampshire voters said overwhelmingly that Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  beat Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  in the debate, according to the poll. While it has just four electoral votes, New Hampshire is important enough to both candidates that each stopped in the state this week.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  is also paying a visit on Friday to Michigan, a state that has not backed a Republican presidential nominee since 1988. Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's campaign believes his strength among blue-collar white voters offers him an opportunity to capture the state, which could scramble the electoral map.\par \par \uc2 But a new survey from The Detroit News taken after the debate indicates Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  still enjoys a solid lead there. She is the favorite of 42 percent of Michigan's likely voters while Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  is preferred by 35 percent; Mr. Johnson received 9 percent support and Ms. Stein 3 percent.\par \par \uc2 As in the other states, a majority of Michigan voters said she won the debate. As significant, 63 percent of the Michigan voters surveyed said they did not think Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  was qualified to be president.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , who visited a black church in Detroit, is receiving next to no support from African-Americans in the state. But just as striking, he is losing the suburban Detroit county of Oakland, one of the state's most competitive jurisdictions, by 20 percentage points.\par \par \uc2 Find out what you need to know about the 2016 presidential race today, and get politics news updates via \uc2 Facebook\uc2 , \uc2 Twitter\uc2  and the First Draft newsletter.\par \par \uc2 Online Correction: September 30, 2016, Friday\par \par \uc2 This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An earlier version of this article referred incorrectly to Michigan's vote in every presidential \uc2 election\uc2  since 1988. It has backed every Democratic nominee, not every Republican nominee.\par \par \uc2 Document NYTF000020161001eca10004d\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 In a race that polls show will cleave to ideological lines, a major focus this week has been how many people vote, and how early.\par \par \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  was in Iowa on Thursday to promote the kickoff of early voting in the state, which polls show has moved toward \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 In-person voting has begun there, and in places like Florida, a critical swing state, early voting will start in the coming days. At the same time, voter registration efforts are underway on college campuses and elsewhere, including one called TurboVote, a nonpartisan effort with 35 technology firms and other companies that have pledged to try to bolster voter rolls.\par \par \uc2 The reality of modern elections is that a large chunk of the outcome is determined before \uc2 Election\uc2  Day, including through absentee ballot requests.\par \par \uc2 Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  has been buoyed by public opinion polls that have showed her handily winning her first debate against Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  in New York this week. It was a performance that helped slow Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's momentum after a difficult period for Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  following her diagnosis of pneumonia.\par \par \uc2 As votes are beginning to be cast, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  is locked in one of his worst series of news cycles of the general \uc2 election\uc2 , after he doubled down on descriptions of a Miss Universe winner (he used to own the pageant) as overweight. He has sought to shift off that discussion, but has done so by raising questions, both himself and through surrogates, that cast \uc2 Bill \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's marital infidelities as a character issue for his wife.\par \par \uc2 Find out what you need to know about the 2016 presidential race today, and get politics news updates via \uc2 Facebook\uc2 , \uc2 Twitter\uc2  and the First Draft newsletter.\par \par \uc2 Document NYTF000020161001eca10004c\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 OP-ED COLUMNIST\par \uc2 Editorial Desk; SECTA\par \b \uc2 How Could Anyone Vote for \uc2 Trump\uc2 ?\b0\par\par\uc2 By GAIL COLLINS \par \uc2 907 \uc2 words\par \uc2 1 October 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 19\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 That first debate seems to have helped \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  move ahead of \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  in the polls. However, I know that many of you are asking yourselves: Why is this even a question?\par \par \uc2 Why isn't she leading 3 to 1? This is not a normal race between a Democrat and a Republican. One of the candidates has made it clear that he has no attention span or self-control. World security experts in both parties are terrified by the idea of a \uc2 Trump\uc2  presidency. He's screwed small contractors in his business dealings and bought dumb presents for himself with money from his charitable foundation -- a charitable foundation, by the way, that appears to have been managed by a team of gerbils. Also, he keeps changing his positions on critical issues and has paid settlements to people alleging he discriminated against them on the basis of race or not being attractive enough.\par \par \uc2 And you know that's just the beginning.\par \par \uc2 It's possible \uc2 Trump\uc2  is just riding a swell of white-male alienation, but there's a less depressing answer for his staying power. Americans have always been pretty pragmatic about the presidents they pick. Mostly, they go for change or not-change.\par \par \uc2 Given all the complications out there, it's a pretty pragmatic approach. If the same president has been in office for eight years, they pick his successor from the other party. Give or take a few vice presidents, it's a rule that goes back to Rutherford B. Hayes.\par \par \uc2 So there's a lot of pressure in the Republican direction, and you certainly can't argue that \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  doesn't represent change. We're just hoping people realize it's the kind of change you get if you decide to remove the trash by driving a bulldozer through the kitchen.\par \par \uc2 Right now, we need Republicans who can show the country that sometimes you have a candidate who's so irresponsible, unprepared and flat-out crazy there's got to be a change exception.\par \par \uc2 The elected officials are pretty much universally in a cowering position. But you'd think George W. Bush, who kept calling himself ''The Decider,'' would stop avoiding the entire question. And Jeb Bush! When reporters cornered him this week, he said, ''Well, if everybody didn't vote, that would be a pretty powerful political statement, wouldn't it?''\par \par \uc2 Not every year you hear a former presidential candidate come out for civic sloth.\par \par \uc2 Going to the polls on \uc2 Election\uc2  Day is one of our core responsibilities in a democratic nation. If we gave ourselves a pass for any year when we didn't like either option, there would be dozens of elections in which nobody came.\par \par \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  is an imperfect candidate who is, nevertheless, extremely well qualified to lead the country. Every day, dozens of prominent Republicans say they're going to suck it up and vote for her because they think she can, if nothing else, at least keep the country safe. Newspapers that have never endorsed a Democrat for president in modern history have taken the brave step of coming out for \uc2 Clinton\uc2 . George H. W. Bush has told people he's voting for her. (Jeb said it was unfair for people to pass along the comments of a 92-year-old man.)\par \par \uc2 When last heard from, \uc2 Mitt Romney\uc2  appeared to be sticking with his vague threats to vote for the Libertarian, Gary Johnson. Earlier in the year, Johnson looked like a conceivable Republican cop-out. Sure he's a little ...-- libertarian, but he wants to whack the heck out of taxes, and he dismisses global warming as something we can deal with by eventually moving to another planet.\par \par \uc2 But recently, people have begun to give Johnson the attention he's been demanding incessantly for the last year, and it turns out -- he's an idiot. We've all heard that he responded to a question about the Syrian crisis with ''And what is Aleppo?'' He had the same look of wonderment when he was asked about his international role models. ''Who's my favorite foreign leader?'' he responded blankly, as if Chris Matthews had demanded that he name his favorite Fiery Furnaces song.\par \par \uc2 So even if voting for a third-party candidate with no chance of winning was not a ridiculous cop-out, we've eliminated Gary Johnson. That leaves only three options for people who hate both \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  and \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 A) Announce you're not going to vote, saying, ''I know, Afghan voters braved death threats from the \uc2 Taliban\uc2  to go to the polls, but I am just too depressed.''\par \par \uc2 B) Follow the Ted Cruz lead and say you've decided to vote for \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2 . Perhaps you could wear a badge saying ''I'm like Ted.'' Your friends might feel this means you're so obsessed with self-promotion you'd throw in your lot with a person who insulted your wife and suggested your father might be connected to the Kennedy assassination. But I'm sure they'll understand you're really only interested in the repeal of Obamacare.\par \par \uc2 C) Go vote for \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 . Nobody sulks during critical moments.\par \par \uc2 I invite you to join me on \uc2 Facebook\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Follow The \uc2 New York Times\uc2  Opinion section on \uc2 Facebook\uc2  and \uc2 Twitter\uc2  (@NYTopinion), and sign up for the Opinion Today newsletter.\par \par \uc2 Document NYTF000020161001eca10003t\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 Politics; SECT\par \b \uc2 Will \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  Play Infidelity Card at Debate? \uc2 Clinton\uc2  Camp Girds\b0\par\par\uc2 By MAGGIE HABERMAN and AMY CHOZICK \par \uc2 1,440 \uc2 words\par \uc2 1 October 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 The New York Times on the Web\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's campaign is preparing for the possibility that \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , reeling from harsh criticisms of his performance at the first presidential debate, will unleash a personal assault related to her husband's infidelities at their next face-off in a week.\par \par \uc2 It is an attack that her campaign aides have been aware could come since 2015, when Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's aides raised the impeachment battle that defined \uc2 Bill \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's second term as president to criticize Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's character.\par \par \uc2 Now, with Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's advisers struggling to refocus the race away from his critiques of the appearance of Alicia Machado, the former Miss Universe winner who was invoked by Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  during the debate, the Republican nominee's campaign has signaled a slashing effort going forward.\par \par \uc2 Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's team, Democrats supporting her and many senior Republicans believe that rehashing Mr. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's behavior will be self-defeating for Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , who is facing a historic gender gap and whose first marriage ended after an affair. Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  has also previously tended to benefit when she is seen as a victim of personal attacks.\par \par \uc2 Still, Democrats consider such tactics inevitable, particularly since Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  is now being advised by several people connected to efforts in the late 1990s to reveal Mr. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's affair with the White House intern Monica Lewinsky and to the subsequent impeachment fight.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's debate prep sessions included discussions about using the attack as a response if Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  discussed the Republican nominee's treatment of women over the years. Now, there is a debate about whether to raise it to Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's face at the next debate, according to two people briefed on the discussions, who were granted anonymity to discuss internal deliberations.\par \par \uc2 To prepare for such an attack, the \uc2 Clinton\uc2  campaign and groups supporting her have pored over opposition research about Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's statements about women over the years, as well as his marital history, preparing memos and papers that can be used to counterattack.\par \par \uc2 ''We are firmly convinced that he is only raising this because he is on defense over his own sexist comments about Alicia Machado and he is lashing out now in a position of total weakness,'' said a \uc2 Clinton\uc2  spokesman, Brian Fallon.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , a first-time candidate with a decades-long trail of negative comments on talk radio and in interviews about women's appearances and abilities, has only haltingly broached both the subject of Mr. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  and his infidelities -- as well as disputed claims that Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  worked to discredit women involved with her husband. But through talking points administered to surrogates on Wednesday that referred to Mr. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's affairs and how Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  handled them, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  has injected it into the bloodstream without saying it himself, a tactic he has used throughout his campaign.\par \par \uc2 He discussed it himself in passing at his one public event on Thursday, a rally in Bedford, N.H.\par \par \uc2 ''The American people have had it with years and decades of \uc2 Clinton\uc2  corruption and scandal, corruption and scandal. And impeachment for lying. Impeachment for lying. Remember that? Impeach,'' Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  said.\par \par \uc2 Democrats believe such critiques will become only harsher and more pointed.\par \par \uc2 Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  declined to wade into the topic on Thursday. ''I'm not going to comment on how he runs his campaign. You'll be able to see -- we have two more debates -- what he says and what I say,'' told reporters.\par \par \uc2 But Republicans have questioned whether such a line of attack would be effective. Several prominent party members, including Gov. Asa Hutchinson of Arkansas, who as a congressman helped lead the impeachment case against Mr. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  20 years ago, have said publicly that they believe Mr. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's behavior is a dead issue and that Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  should ''look to the future.''\par \par \uc2 Correct \uc2 the Record\uc2 , a ''super PAC'' that defends Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , has troves of background on women, including Juanita Broaddrick and Kathleen Willey, who have accused Mr. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  of sexual assault. The group has also prepared a vicious counterattack on Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's marital history, which includes two divorces and infidelity.\par \par \uc2 Some of Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's advisers have tried to suggest a narrower line of attack: focusing on allegations that Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  tried to discredit women who said they had been harassed by Mr. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 . Chief among those suggesting this approach is Roger Stone, the longest-serving \uc2 Trump\uc2  adviser, who wrote a book called ''The Clintons' War on Women,'' which lays out allegations from Ms. Broaddrick and Ms. Willey, which the Clintons or their lawyer David Kendall have denied. ''The issue of \uc2 Bill \uc2 Clinton\uc2  and women is not about marital infidelity, adultery or 'indiscretions,''' Mr. Stone said.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , however, has struggled to articulate that concept, and around 5 a.m. Friday he posted a series of posts on \uc2 Twitter\uc2  attacking Ms. Machado once again.\par \par \uc2 Jason Miller, a spokesman for Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , did not respond to an email seeking comment.\par \par \uc2 Before he ran for president, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , who invited the Clintons to his third wedding, dismissed the Lewinsky scandal as a nonissue. But the \uc2 Trump\uc2  campaign, in its third iteration of leadership, is now populated with and advised by people who witnessed the impeachment firsthand, and who see it as a potent issue. They were once part of what Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  dismissed as the ''vast right-wing conspiracy'' intent on dredging up scandals involving Mr. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , including the Lewinsky issue.\par \par \uc2 David Bossie\uc2 , Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's deputy campaign manager, is the president of the conservative group \uc2 Citizens United\uc2 , and worked as an investigator who searched Arkansas for evidence of Mr. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's personal misdeeds during the 1992 presidential campaign. Mr. Bossie was later the lead investigator for the House committee investigating Mr. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  over a range of allegations during the late 1990s.\par \par \uc2 Roger Ailes, the ousted chairman of Fox News, used the Lewinsky scandal and the impeachment aftermath to put his fledgling channel on the map. Mr. Ailes advised Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  in preparation for the general \uc2 election\uc2  debates.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's campaign manager, Kellyanne Conway, told The Times in an email on Friday that she believed her candidate showed ''grace'' at the last debate with regard to the topic.\par \par \uc2 Ms. Conway said she was not advocating discussing Mr. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's dalliances, although she said discussing Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's behavior related to those women ''should be more carefully examined.'' It is a topic with which she is familiar -- she is married to George T. Conway III, a lawyer who worked with Paula Jones, whose suit claiming Mr. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  had sexually harassed her years earlier helped precipitate the impeachment hearings. (Ms. Conway met her husband well after the case had concluded).\par \par \uc2 Rudolph W. Giuliani\uc2 , the former mayor of New York City, planned to run for the Senate from New York against Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  in 2000, as she was trying to put the impeachment scandal behind her. Mr. Giuliani has become one of Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's closest allies, and he was the first to explicitly mention the Lewinsky scandal after their debate.\par \par \uc2 Christopher Ruddy, who runs the conservative website Newsmax and who looked into allegations around the death of the \uc2 Clinton\uc2  White House aide Vincent W. Foster Jr., said he thought this was a fruitless line of attack.\par \par \uc2 ''I don't think it's smart politics to dredge up 20-year-old allegations,'' Mr. Ruddy, who has contributed money to Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , said of efforts to politicize Mr. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's personal behavior. ''It didn't work back in the '90s.''\par \par \uc2 Newt Gingrich\uc2 , the former House speaker who helped initiate the impeachment proceedings and who now supports Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , criticized the approach in an email, saying, ''The bigger the choice the more likely \uc2 Trump\uc2  is to win, the smaller the topic the more likely Hillary is to win.''\par \par \uc2 Carl Paladino\uc2 , Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's New York campaign chairman, said that it was not ''a topic of discussion,'' but he also indicated that he considered it fair game if Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  attacked Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  over his treatment of women.\par \par \uc2 Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's allies said that would be dangerous.\par \par \uc2 ''This is not a road \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  wants to go down,'' said David Brock, a former conservative muckraker who worked to expose the Paula Jones story but who came to support the Clintons and now runs Correct \uc2 the Record\uc2  and other groups that defend Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Find out what you need to know about the 2016 presidential race today, and get politics news updates via \uc2 Facebook\uc2 , \uc2 Twitter\uc2  and the First Draft newsletter.\par \par \uc2 Document NYTF000020161001eca10003s\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 National Desk; SECTA\par \b \uc2 Backlog Stymies Aspiring Citizens Yearning to Vote\b0\par\par\uc2 By JULIA PRESTON \par \uc2 1,197 \uc2 words\par \uc2 1 October 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 1\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 They stayed up late studying for civics tests. They went to classes, paid hefty fees and underwent background checks.\par \par \uc2 During the last year, nearly a million legal immigrants applied to become American citizens, many of them hoping to take the oath of citizenship in time to cast their first ballots on Nov. 8 in a presidential race where immigration has been fiercely debated.\par \par \uc2 But as the number of aspiring citizens grew this year, the backlog at the federal agency that approves naturalizations swelled. With the agency now reporting that it takes up to seven months to complete the process, Obama administration officials are reluctantly admitting that many -- perhaps most -- of the immigrants in the backlog will not become citizens in time to vote.\par \par \uc2 ''I've been checking my mail every day, but I haven't heard anything,'' said Francisca Fiero, 73, a Mexican immigrant in Las Vegas. ''I'm starting to get very worried.''\par \par \uc2 Ms. Fiero, who has had a green card for a decade, applied in January and gave her fingerprints in June. Since then, nothing. The voter registration deadline in Nevada is Oct. 18.\par \par \uc2 In the last year almost 940,000 legal immigrants applied to become citizens, a 23 percent surge over the previous year. As of June 30, more than 520,000 applications were waiting to be examined, a pileup that increased steadily since last year.\par \par \uc2 Immigration officials ''anticipated that there would be a spike in applications this year, but the increase has exceeded expectations,'' said Jeffrey T. Carter, a spokesman for the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services, the agency in charge of naturalizations.\par \par \uc2 The official figures revealing the backlog, published in late September, came as a shock to immigrant groups that put on a nationwide push early this year to help eligible immigrants to naturalize. Some of the biggest increases in applications came in battleground states where they had focused their efforts, including a 30 percent increase over a year earlier in Colorado, a 40 percent increase in Florida and a 53 percent increase in Nevada.\par \par \uc2 ''The agency has developed an acute case of the slows, and it could not be a more critical moment,'' said Tara Raghuveer, deputy director of the National Partnership for New Americans, a coalition of 37 groups that held citizenship workshops around the country. The groups scrambled to file applications before May 1, she said, after the immigration agency originally advised them that the process would take four to six months.\par \par \uc2 This year for the first time the naturalization drive also had high-profile backing from the White House, which sponsored ad campaigns, gave $10 million to community groups and made fixes to make it easier to apply. But officials said the White House was not monitoring the results to confirm that the immigration agency was completing naturalizations in a timely way.\par \par \uc2 In the presidential race between \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  and \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , the immigrant vote could be pivotal, especially in states with large numbers of Latino immigrants.\par \par \uc2 The naturalization backlogs are bad news for Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  because polls in those states show Latinos favoring her by gaping margins. In Florida, for example, more than 66,000 potential new voters stuck in the backlog could be enough to affect the outcome of a race that polls show is a virtual tie.\par \par \uc2 Citizenship applications generally surge during presidential \uc2 election\uc2  cycles. In 2007 and 2008, more than 1.4 million immigrants became citizens, stirred by a combination of an impending fee increase and the historic candidacy of \uc2 Barack Obama\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 This year, immigrant groups set a goal of one million naturalizations, and the application numbers were on track to reach it. In May, the Obama administration announced another fee increase for later this year, which could have moved some latecomers to apply. Then the backlogs emerged.\par \par \uc2 Many immigrants decided to become citizens because they just wanted to vote, without being drawn to a particular candidate.\par \par \uc2 ''I want to put in my voice to be heard just like everybody else,'' said Geraldine Rolle, a 65-year-old immigrant from the Bahamas, who has been a legal resident since 1991 and now lives in Fort Lauderdale, Fla.\par \par \uc2 She applied in February. After having her photograph taken in April, she heard nothing more. ''They keep telling me you have to be a citizen to vote, and now it doesn't look like I'm going to get that before the elections,'' Ms. Rolle said sadly.\par \par \uc2 Ms. Fiero, in Las Vegas, has had a rocky time. She came to the United States as a legal resident and has always kept her green card up to date. A cafeteria worker in an elementary school, she applied to naturalize in January. But the agency rejected her application as incomplete.\par \par \uc2 When many similar rejections were reported in Nevada, the Culinary Workers Union, which helped Ms. Fiero and many others to apply, appealed to Senator Harry Reid. Immigration officials acknowledged to Mr. Reid that the applications had been denied by mistake. Ms. Fiero was allowed to apply again a month later.\par \par \uc2 Like many Latino immigrants, Ms. Fiero said she was eager to vote because she does not like Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  and is a fan of Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's. ''She seems like the right person to help poor families get better houses,'' Ms. Fiero said.\par \par \uc2 Officials at the citizenship agency said they shifted employees to offices where the workload had mounted and authorized overtime for many offices. But Mr. Carter, the spokesman, said that nationwide the agency was ''still within our normal processing times.''\par \par \uc2 Internal emails from the immigration agency's Houston office, which were recently leaked by Republican leaders in the Senate, show it was working to pick up the pace. A message on July 21 exhorted employees to finish as many naturalizations as possible before Oct. 1 ''due to the \uc2 election\uc2  year needs.''\par \par \uc2 But in New York, citizenship groups have heard from anxious immigrants who have waited as long as a year with no end in sight. In Nashville, city officials had to cancel a swearing-in ceremony planned to take place this weekend during a festival. The judge scheduled to conduct it reported no immigrants were ready. Immigration officials said other demands on agency employees' time got in the way.\par \par \uc2 The agency is also facing pressure to slow down. In a letter last week, Senators \uc2 Charles E. Grassley\uc2  of Iowa and Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, both Republicans, cited a recent case in which more than 800 immigrants who had been ordered deported were granted citizenship because of gaps in the agency's vetting.\par \par \uc2 Rather than speeding up, the agency ''should instead be putting on the brakes,'' the senators wrote.\par \par \uc2 But at the Culinary Workers Union, immigrants are fuming. ''It really is outrageous that people can do everything right and still be denied an important right as a citizen,'' Yvanna Cancela, a union official, said.\par \par \uc2 A naturalization ceremony held in Atlanta last month.

\par\par \uc2 Foreign Desk; SECTA\par \b \uc2 United at Peres's Funeral, U.S. and Israeli Leaders Who Feuded for Years\b0\par\par\uc2 By MARK LANDLER \par \uc2 1,071 \uc2 words\par \uc2 1 October 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 6\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 WASHINGTON -- When \uc2 Bill \uc2 Clinton\uc2  took his place on Friday at Mount Herzl in Jerusalem for the state funeral of Shimon Peres, he was part of a tangled tableau: leaders from Israel and the United States who came together to mourn a giant of peace but who nurse their own political feuds and rivalries, stretching back two decades.\par \par \uc2 Standing close to the former president was Israel's prime minister, \uc2 Benjamin Netanyahu\uc2 , whom Mr. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  energetically tried to defeat when he challenged Mr. Peres for the prime minister post in 1996. Nearby was President Obama, whom Mr. Netanyahu not so subtly tried to oust in 2012 by signaling his support for \uc2 Mitt Romney\uc2 , Mr. Obama's Republican opponent.\par \par \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  was absent, though she met with Mr. Netanyahu last Sunday in New York. She has not had to deal with him putting his thumb on the electoral scales, even if he did meet with \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2  for 80 minutes at his office in \uc2 Trump\uc2  Tower before seeing her.\par \par \uc2 ''Believe me, he's not a happy camper,'' Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  said of the Israeli leader the next day during his debate with Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 It was the only time Mr. Netanyahu's name came up in the debate, however, and Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's characterization seemed at odds with the reassuring message about the two presidential candidates that Mr. Netanyahu brought back to Israel.\par \par \uc2 ''It doesn't matter which of them will be elected,'' the prime minister told a meeting of his cabinet on Tuesday. ''The support for Israel will remain strong, the alliance will remain strong and will get even stronger in the coming years.''\par \par \uc2 Such equanimity is more the exception than the rule when it comes to how Americans and Israelis view each other's elections. With so much in common, yet so much riding on a handful of delicate national-security issues that sometimes divide them, Israeli and American leaders have found it difficult to avoid meddling in each other's politics.\par \par \uc2 Perhaps the most flagrant example came in the spring of 1996, a few months after the assassination of Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin. Mr. Peres had taken over for his slain friend and rival, pledging to continue Israel's participation in peace talks with the Palestinians, sponsored by Mr. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 . But he faced a wily opponent in the Likud Party's candidate, Mr. Netanyahu, who was running against the peace process.\par \par \uc2 ''Were Netanyahu to be elected, the process begun in Oslo would be in serious jeopardy,'' Martin S. Indyk, then the ambassador to Israel, wrote in his 2009 book about the Middle East, ''Innocent Abroad.'' ''So, too, would \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's entire Middle Eastern strategy.''\par \par \uc2 Dennis B. Ross, who advised Mr. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  on the Middle East, said: ''After the assassination, \uc2 Clinton\uc2  felt he was on a mission to fulfill the Rabin legacy. Peres was Rabin's partner, and was as motivated as \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , and told him so.'' With Mr. Netanyahu running against the Oslo Accords, he added, ''\uc2 Clinton\uc2  was ready to do whatever he could to help Peres.''\par \par \uc2 The president set out to help in ways large and small. In March 1996, Mr. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  organized a summit meeting on the peace process in Sharm el Sheikh, Egypt. Afterward, he flew Mr. Peres home to Israel aboard Air Force One, symbolically wrapping him in a warm embrace.\par \par \uc2 Weeks before the Israeli \uc2 election\uc2 , Mr. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  invited Mr. Peres to Washington to sign the United States-Israel Counterterrorism Cooperation Accord, an agreement that expedited $50 million in emergency aid to Israel at a time when Hezbollah, with help from its Iranian backers, and \uc2 Hamas\uc2  were stepping up suicide bus bombings and other attacks in the country.\par \par \uc2 The White House also sent two well-connected Democratic Party consultants, Doug Schoen and Zev Furst, to coordinate messages with the Peres campaign. On \uc2 election\uc2  night, Mr. Furst recalled, he was in Israel when Mr. Schoen called from the White House, requesting a home number for Mr. Peres. The exit polls showed that he was going to defeat Mr. Netanyahu, and Mr. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  wanted to call to congratulate him.\par \par \uc2 ''I called Peres at home,'' Mr. Furst said, ''and he said, 'This \uc2 election\uc2  is not over yet.' ''\par \par \uc2 Mr. Netanyahu edged out Mr. Peres by less than 30,000 votes, 50.4 percent to 49.5 percent. His victory signaled a turning point for Mr. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's peacemaking ambitions, though as Mr. Indyk wrote, for reasons broader than just Mr. Netanyahu. Iran had decided that undermining the peace process played into its geopolitical strategy.\par \par \uc2 Sixteen years later, Iran was again at the heart of a political contest between Mr. Netanyahu and an American president. Mr. Obama was pushing for a nuclear deal with Iran; Mr. Netanyahu vociferously opposed it. He found a welcome partner in Mr. Romney, who visited Israel in July 2012 as the presumptive Republican nominee and declared that preventing Iran from getting a nuclear bomb should be America's ''highest national security priority.''\par \par \uc2 ''Mitt, I couldn't agree with you more,'' Mr. Netanyahu said at a meeting.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Obama won re-\uc2 election\uc2  -- demonstrating, as Mr. Netanyahu's victory did in 1996, that meddling in an American or an Israeli \uc2 election\uc2  is a dubious strategy. Certainly, that seems to be a lesson that Mr. Netanyahu has learned this time around. But analysts also note that after the signing of the Iran deal, he has no real motivation to do so.\par \par \uc2 ''With the Iran deal, there was a reason to justify interceding,'' said \uc2 Aaron David Miller\uc2 , a former Middle East diplomat now at the \uc2 Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars\uc2 . ''The pretext for interceding, unlike for \uc2 Clinton\uc2  and Peres, simply isn't there.''\par \par \uc2 Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's campaign issued an upbeat, though unrevealing, statement after her meeting with Mr. Netanyahu. Her decision not to attend Mr. Peres's funeral surprised no one, since it would have taken her off the campaign trail for two days at a critical juncture. If her absence does not erase history, it will at least allow Israelis to bid farewell to one of their founding fathers without the intrusion of the current American \uc2 election\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Follow Mark Landler on Twitter at @MarkLandler.\par \par \uc2 Shimon Peres at his 90th birthday party in 2013, flanked by Bill \uc2 Clinton\uc2  and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel.

\par\par \b \uc2 Can \uc2 Trump\uc2  Unlock the Keystone State?\b0\par\par\uc2 By Joseph Rago   \par \uc2 1,948 \uc2 words\par \uc2 1 October 2016\par \uc2 The Wall Street Journal\par \uc2 J\par A9\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 York, Pa. -- \uc2 Mike Pence\uc2  is as smooth as cold-rolled steel, and as politically conventional as his running mate is not. At a solo rally here just north of the Mason-Dixon Line on Thursday afternoon, the self-deprecating "B-list Republican celebrity" says he's "humbled, I truly am" by the substantial crowd, and he uses expressions like "a hill of beans."\par \par \uc2 "History teaches us that weakness gives rise to evil," he says, and a succession of putative Barack Obama-Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  foreign-policy failures "are a testament to this truth of history." \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  rarely invokes truths of history, or testaments to anything.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Pence's only misstep was to hold the event at an irresistible campaign metaphor, a garbage-processing warehouse of a local waste-disposal company that also rents dumpsters. Not since \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's 2014 appearance at the \uc2 Institute of Scrap Recycling Industries\uc2  convention, for a $225,500 speaking fee, has a politician so gratuitously fed the national media narrative.\par \par \uc2 And yet, reality confounds. The company, Penn Waste, was formed in 2000 by \uc2 Scott Wagner\uc2 , and he's since grown his original four-man, two-truck business into 400 employees and 120 trucks that serve 180,000 households. Mr. Wagner then ran for state senate in 2014, he says, because regulations that used to fit in a manila folder now fill a binder 6 inches thick. He won, in the first successful Pennsylvania write-in campaign.\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 Trump\uc2  phenomenon finds anecdotal expression in material artifacts -- hats, and in Pennsylvania in particular, yard signs. They're everywhere. Mr. Wagner says that three weeks ago he personally bought 10,000 of them and they were gone in 10 days. The nature of Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's appeal, he says, is that "people have never been more fed up with the status quo. They're hungry for change."\par \par \uc2 Pennsylvania is a reach for the \uc2 Trump\uc2 -Pence campaign. A Republican hasn't carried this political and demographic bridge between the East Coast and the Midwest since 1988. Then again, for the last two decades the commonwealth has been gradually trending toward the GOP and lending Democrats smaller bounds of victory in presidential \uc2 election\uc2  years. Pre-debate, most Pennsylvania polls -- which had previously found a substantial \uc2 Clinton\uc2  advantage -- had narrowed to close to the margin of error.\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 Clinton\uc2  campaign and an allied Super Pac declined to include Pennsylvania in an eight-state TV-ad buy over the summer, and former Obama campaign manager \uc2 David Plouffe\uc2  wrote on \uc2 Twitter\uc2  that this showed "real discipline" because "PA is not a true battleground." Evidently Democrats have reconsidered.\par \par \uc2 Bill \uc2 Clinton\uc2  toured western Pennsylvania three weeks ago, President Obama told a Philadelphia crowd two weeks ago that Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  doesn't "believe in democracy," and Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  returned to Philly last week for her "I need you" overture to millennial voters. \uc2 Joe Biden\uc2  was back this week, \uc2 Chelsea \uc2 Clinton\uc2  was at State College, and \uc2 Michelle Obama\uc2  was at Pitt.\par \par \uc2 Pennsylvania's 20 electoral votes could be decisive in 2016. If Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  wins all the Democratic redoubts and Michigan, New Hampshire and Wisconsin, where she has solid leads, she'll cross the 270-vote threshold with Colorado and Pennsylvania. If she loses one of those, she'd need to win North Carolina, Ohio or Florida, all of which are statistically tied. Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , who pays a visit to Manheim, in Lancaster County, on Saturday, could make it a close race.\par \par \uc2 John Brabender, a GOP consultant and Rick Santorum's longtime adviser, who knows the state, figures the race has narrowed from about 8 percentage points over the summer to about four, and could perhaps settle at one or two in the coming weeks. The key for Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , he says, is understanding the seams of Pennsylvania's political geography.\par \par \uc2 Democrats hold a registered-voter advantage of about a million people, 49% to 38% (12% are "other"). In 2012 the split was 50% to 36%. These Democrats are concentrated in Allegheny County, Pittsburgh's seat; smaller cities like Harrisburg and Scranton; and above all the machine city of Philadelphia.\par \par \uc2 The Republicans who dominate the most sparsely populated rural regions in Pennsylvania's central and western tiers are very conservative, politically and otherwise. Mr. Obama's 2008 remarks about the people who "get bitter" and "cling to guns or religion or antipathy toward people who aren't like them" were inspired by his experiences in "these small towns in Pennsylvania."\par \par \uc2 Democrats tend to capture the urban areas and Republicans the rest of the state -- Mr. Obama won 13 of 67 counties for a 5.4-point margin in 2012. But elections are decided by the swing voters in the four large "collar" counties around Philadelphia proper -- Bucks, Chester, Delaware and Montgomery. These voters -- more women than men -- are predominantly white, well-educated, suburban and higher income. Their politics are moderate or liberal culturally, moderate or conservative fiscally. Of the Quaker State's 5.6 million votes in 2012, 1.2 million were cast there.\par \par \uc2 Stitching together a GOP coalition across these constituencies is a formidable challenge, but it can be done, as Pat Toomey showed in 2010. The senator, and the only Republican to hold statewide office, won 51% to 49%. He's distinguished himself in Washington as a fiscal expert with a pragmatic side.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  hasn't been the deadweight for GOP incumbents that most analysts expected earlier this year, though Mr. Toomey is keeping his distance. He hasn't endorsed but says he's reserving judgment, and he didn't show up at the Pence rally. "I know I'm not the only Pennsylvanian who feels uncomfortable with the choices we have," he said at a press luncheon on Monday.\par \par \uc2 On the trail, Mr. Toomey tries to demonstrate his independence and experience, and he underscores local issues like public safety. Lately Mr. Toomey has been conducting a lively debate about middle-class tax hikes with his Democratic opponent, Katie McGinty, a former Al Gore-Bill \uc2 Clinton\uc2  hand and Governor \uc2 Tom Wolf\uc2 's chief of staff.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Toomey, along with Ohio's Rob Portman and Florida's \uc2 Marco Rubio\uc2 , is one more GOP '16er who lucked out in the quality of his opposition. Joe Sestak, a difficult former congressman, was leading for most of the primary. Mr. Obama and the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee intervened to drag Ms. McGinty across the finish line. She's never held elective office, and the lack of vetting is conspicuous.\par \par \uc2 Ms. McGinty is running on her modest upbringing and used to say she was the first member of her blue-collar family to go to college. Then it emerged that one of her older brothers graduated eight years before she matriculated (and then went on to get a master's). Ms. McGinty modified her claim: She was the first to attend "a four-year college, straight out of high school." Her speech at the Democratic convention in Philadelphia in July -- "We can build on the strength of our diversity, and the diversity of our strength" -- bombed.\par \par \uc2 More to the point, Ms. McGinty is a creature of the Bernie Sanders-Elizabeth Warren wing of the Democratic Party, and the Vermont socialist convened one of his revival meetings with the Democrat this month at \uc2 Carnegie Mellon\uc2 . So did Ms. Warren, at Penn.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Toomey is betting that his more heterodox political profile better fits suburban moderates. The \uc2 Mike Bloomberg\uc2 -backed Super Pac, Independence USA, is running ads in the Philadelphia market showcasing his work to expand background checks for firearm buyers. He could pick up crossover \uc2 Clinton\uc2  voters in the collar counties who are mindful about taxes and spending.\par \par \uc2 Pennsylvanians separate Messrs. \uc2 Trump\uc2  and Toomey, with only 28% telling CBS News-YouGov this month that they're "the same kind of Republican." Another advantage is that he's a fearsome fundraiser.\par \par \uc2 Still, while Mr. Toomey and Ms. McGinty are swapping places for the lead from poll to poll, in most competitive states surveys suggest that support for Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  and the GOP Senate candidates are closely correlated. Pennsylvania so far is not among the exceptions like Ohio, so his fortunes are probably hostage to Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's.\par \par \uc2 At the Pence rally, the biggest applause lines were trade, immigration, guns and cultural identification: "You know, \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  is someone who has never forgotten the men and women who built this country, the men and women who work with their hands, who grow our food, who build our roads and bridges, who keep us safe and teach our kids," Mr. Pence said.\par \par \uc2 Sometimes, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's calculation seems to be the opposite of Mr. Toomey's suburban play: that the politics of Rust Belt decline can win the white working class without college degrees, union Democrats and disaffected voters. "When I'm president, guess what, steel is coming back to Pittsburgh. Coal -- we're bringing it back," Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  said in a speech there in June, promising to restore the lost greatness of a time when "wage earners could support their family on the income from the mill."\par \par \uc2 Yet Pennsylvania is "ground zero for the two contradictory elements of this campaign -- the sense that things are going well and the sense that things are going poorly," says David Shribman, the venerable executive editor of the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette. In a politically polarized country with uneven economic progress and enough cause for both despair and hope, the reality is more complicated.\par \par \uc2 When the old steel and other heavy industries started to break up in the 1960s amid domestic competition, it was merely known as destruction in Pittsburgh, not the creative kind. But the "Paris of Appalachia" has diversified into medicine, higher education and now high tech, especially the emerging field of robotics. Today the anchor tenant of the famous U.S. Steel Tower is the \uc2 University of Pittsburgh Medical Center\uc2 . Philadelphia can tell a similar story of economic renewal.\par \par \uc2 Coal mining has been more recently undermined by environmental regulation that has devastated some communities, even as other parts of rural Pennsylvania are being transformed by shale drilling for natural gas in the Marcellus and Utica basins. In the Lehigh Valley, once headquarters to \uc2 Bethlehem Steel\uc2 , advanced manufacturing, logistics, high-value business services and the life sciences have displaced the factory line. Some small businesses do prosper, such as Mr. Wagner's in York.\par \par \uc2 Other times Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  even recognizes this tendency. There's a reason he rolled out his child-care tax credit in Aston, Pa., in Delaware County.\par \par \uc2 To win, Mr. Brabender thinks Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  needs to pass "the cocktail party test": Can people say they support Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  in polite company, without the other guests recoiling in horror? Some 13 of Pennsylvania's 18 congressmen are Republicans, so there is a potential market.\par \par \uc2 He argues Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's occasionally more optimistic tone in his prepared speeches could help, as well as a "Lee Iacocca advertising strategy" with TV spots that feature turnaround themes and a positive vision for the country. Field research in the Midwest by Alex Castellanos's Rebuilding America Now outfit also suggests such an approach could work.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  is being badly outworked in Pennsylvania by the \uc2 Clinton\uc2  campaign with its 55 field offices and hundreds of organizers, so his message may simply be overwhelmed by Democratic turnout. But if he flips the commonwealth for the first time in seven elections, the irony may be that the causes are likely to be more complex than his anti-trade populism.\par \par \uc2 ---\par \par \uc2 Mr. Rago is a member of the Journal's editorial board.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=wjco20161001000084"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document J000000020161001eca10002i\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw272\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4080\pichgoal600

\par\par \b \uc2 REVIEW --- Game On: The Playful Side of Elections\b0\par\par\uc2 By Christopher Chabris   \par \uc2 835 \uc2 words\par \uc2 1 October 2016\par \uc2 The Wall Street Journal\par \uc2 J\par C4\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 Monday's debate between \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  and \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  gave viewers everything from the candidates' thoughts on the issues to a case of the sniffles and a surprising shimmy. If you found yourself thinking that you could do a better job on the stage -- or just wishing that the \uc2 election\uc2  were taking a different course -- two new games may satisfy your political appetite.\par \par \uc2 The Contender, a social card game created by Justin Young and John Teasdale, puts players in a mock debate. In each round, one player serves as moderator, the others as candidates. The moderator draws a random card that presents a question, such as this one on the economy, rendered in typical news-anchor style: "Have Wall Street and Silicon Valley combined to leave Main Street in a ditch?"\par \par \uc2 The candidates then select response cards from their own hands. These cards are euphemistically said to contain "arguments," but they are mostly one-liners, deflections and slogans. The game's 2016 expansion pack is up-to-date with lines like, "Just go to my website," "Let's dispel with this fiction," and the inevitable "Believe me" and "Yuge!" Messrs. Young and Teasdale are also releasing flash-printed updates right after each debate. The first set includes cards labeled "I know you live in your own reality" and "Nobody called Sean Hannity."\par \par \uc2 The entertainment comes from the back-and-forth repartee as players try to make the best arguments -- or get in the funniest zingers. After each candidate has played three response cards, the moderator picks a winner for the round and that person is the moderator for the next round. Whoever wins the most rounds wins the game.\par \par \uc2 For those who are more interested in the macro battle for electoral-college votes, the game Campaign Trail simulates the strategic aspects of a presidential \uc2 election\uc2 . It was developed by brothers Nathan and Jeff Cornelius, based on a homemade game created by their father. The board is a large map of the U.S. filled with clusters of pieces (red for Republican, blue for Democratic and white for independent) to mark how much support each player/candidate has across the country. Each player gets cards to determine what actions he or she can take, such as raising funds, conducting a voter-registration drive, advertising and so on. These actions ultimately result in gaining or losing votes in the states where they are taken. Just as in real politics, resources are limited, and different issues and positions matter more or less depending on where you are in the country.\par \par \uc2 Each candidate in the game has a special ability that makes some actions more effective than others. For example, the Party Favorite receives more voters from a voter-registration drive than do other candidates, while the Wealthy Candidate doesn't need to raise as much money for his campaign. A variety of special circumstances, such as October Surprise and Recount, may also pop up and change the balance in the campaign.\par \par \uc2 Mao famously said that politics was war without bloodshed, and in fact, Campaign Trail is like a war game without battles. Republican and Democratic voters occupy the same spaces (states), but the only conflict is the peaceful awarding of electoral votes based on which candidate gathers the most votes in each state. After three rounds of play, corresponding roughly to the final three months of the campaign, all remaining cards are played on \uc2 election\uc2  day, and the final vote total in the electoral college determines a winner.\par \par \uc2 Campaign Trail is the best simulation of an \uc2 election\uc2  that I have seen. By centering the action on a map filled with red and blue vote markers, it evokes the feeling of being a top-level political strategist. But just as war games are highly symbolic representations of actual warfare, Campaign Trail is an abstraction of political reality. Without the concrete details and the idiosyncratic, unpredictable events of the real world, it lacks some of the fun too. There are no cards for "Republican front-runner sued for running fraudulent university," or "Democratic Party emails hacked by Russian agents."\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 election\uc2  game genre isn't new. \uc2 Election\uc2 -themed versions of traditional board games, in which pieces race around a track, appeared as early as the 1950s. More sophisticated games let you replay historical elections, including Kennedy-Nixon (1960: The Making of the President) and McCain-Obama (Campaign Manager 2008). The most respected political game may be the complex Die Macher, first published in 1986, in which the players are German political parties battling for victory in a set of local elections.\par \par \uc2 Although they are quite different, Campaign Trail and The Contender have one thing in common: They are independent projects, having been crowdfunded through Kickstarter rather than published by major game companies. That's something new in the world of \uc2 election\uc2  games, like so much else in this crazy \uc2 election\uc2  season.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=wjco20161001000046"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document J000000020161001eca10001h\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw272\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4080\pichgoal600

\par\par \b \uc2 Hillary-Hatred Derangement Syndrome\b0\par\par\uc2 By Dorothy Rabinowitz   \par \uc2 1,065 \uc2 words\par \uc2 30 September 2016\par \uc2 The Wall Street Journal\par \uc2 J\par A13\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 There were cheers when \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  assured his Virginia audience last weekend that the wall will be built and, yes, that Mexico would pay for it. But the cheers lacked the roaring ecstasy his promise used to evoke at rallies. No one has the heart, by now, to pretend that such a wall will actually be built, but that's all right with Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's dauntless fans, who can find plenty of other reasons for their faith in him. The NeverTrump forces, appalled at the prospect of a \uc2 Trump\uc2  presidency, are no less passionate.\par \par \uc2 The NeverHillary forces are another matter entirely -- citizens well aware of the darker aspects of \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2 's character but who have nonetheless concluded that they should give him their vote. They are aware of his casual disregard for truth, his self-obsession, his ignorance, his ingrained vindictiveness. Not even the first presidential debate, which saw him erupt into a snarling aside about \uc2 Rosie O'Donnell\uc2 , could loosen his hold on that visceral drive to inflict payback, in this case over a feud 10 years old.\par \par \uc2 The NeverHillary forces are aware, too, of his grandiosity -- his announcement that he knows more about Islamic State than any of America's generals will long be remembered -- his impulse-driven character, his insatiable need for applause, the head-turning effect on him of an approving word from \uc2 Vladimir Putin\uc2 . The Russian leader's compliment late last year was of the mildest kind -- he referred to Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  as "talented" and "colorful" -- but it was enough to make the candidate's heart go pitter-patter with gratitude and engender instant expressions of his faith in Mr. Putin's integrity and leadership. As Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  himself has explained, "if he says nice things about me, I'm going to say nice things about him."\par \par \uc2 Such are the values that drive the Republican candidate's judgment -- a fact interesting to contemplate as one imagines a President \uc2 Trump\uc2  dealing with international conflict and rogue heads of state. Still Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  is now the choice of voters who have concluded that of the two flawed contenders running, he would be far preferable.\par \par \uc2 Yes, he may be rough around the edges, but he's a fresh force, the argument goes, unlike the establishment war horse, Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , with her history of scandal and rumors thereof, and her decades in politics. Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  is the dynamo who will blow up the old order. He's authentic, a man with the courage of his convictions.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  has not, of course, shown himself notably reliable as regards the courage of his convictions. It's by now impossible to count the number of times and ways in which he's sidled away from his grand plans on immigration, that promise to deport everyone here illegally, not to mention his proposal to institute a total block on Muslim immigration "till we figure things out." He's proffered no less than three different views on abortion, one of which called for "at least some punishment" for the woman involved -- quickly changed to wait, no, it should be the doctor.\par \par \uc2 Still, it was the view of \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  as a fearless foe of liberal piety, that image of him as an outsider, untainted by experience in government -- itself one of the more remarkable boasts of any presidential campaign in memory -- that persuaded so many Americans he is the leader the country needs. As opposed, that is, to Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  -- the educated former secretary of state, with lengthy experience in government.\par \par \uc2 Equally remarkable, even for a change \uc2 election\uc2 , that experience, those years of education in national security somehow rank high on the list of defects the anti-Hillary brigades find so objectionable. Here is a flaw apparently even more rankling than her email server history, the questions about Benghazi, or the \uc2 Clinton\uc2  Foundation\uc2 : She offers nothing of Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's aura of free-swinging dynamism, not to mention a mind blissfully uncluttered by facts, knowledge of geopolitical realities, and the like.\par \par \uc2 Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  hasn't failed to provide, on her own, cause for concern about her own proclivities and never more intolerably than in that debate Monday when she chose to ramble on, familiarly, about institutional racism, which invariably emerges in her responses on conflagration involving police action. Americans have a right to cringe at this reflexive, factually distorted, and inflammatory sermonizing. The accompanying, deep felt tribute to the police and their heroism, invariably added, can never offset the insidiousness of these messages.\par \par \uc2 Even so, such proclivities pale next to the occasion for cringing that would come with a \uc2 Trump\uc2  presidency. No one witnessing Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's primary race -- his accumulation of Alt-Right cheerleaders, white supremacists and swastika devotees -- could fail to notice the menacing tone and the bitterness that came with it.\par \par \uc2 Not for nothing did the Democrats bring off a triumph of a convention, alive with cheer, not to mention its two visitors whose story would lift countless American hearts. They were, of course, the Muslim couple Khizr and Ghazala Khan, whose son, Capt. Humayun Khan -- brought here as a child -- died in Iraq in 2004, saving his men from an explosive-rigged car.\par \par \uc2 His countrymen now go streaming to his grave at Arlington National Cemetery to leave notes and flowers. He reminded us of who we are -- the nation that takes its newcomers and transforms them into Americans. After 9/11, Capt. Khan, American, could scarcely wait to serve his country. The national response to the Khans injected a sense of unity and affirmation, however brief, into an atmosphere of embittering divisiveness.\par \par \uc2 The end of the \uc2 election\uc2  is now in sight. Some among the anti-Hillary brigades have decided, in deference to their exquisite sensibilities, to stay at home on \uc2 Election\uc2  Day, rather than vote for Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 . But most Americans will soon make their choice. It will be either Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  or Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  -- experienced, forward-looking, indomitably determined and eminently sane. Her \uc2 election\uc2  alone is what stands between the American nation and the reign of the most unstable, proudly uninformed, psychologically unfit president ever to enter the White House.\par \par \uc2 ---\par \par \uc2 Ms. Rabinowitz is a member of the Journal's editorial board.\par \par \uc2 (See related letters: "Letters to the Editor: Bipartisan \uc2 Election\uc2  Derangement Syndrome" -- WSJ Oct. 6, 2016)\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=wjco20160930000067"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document J000000020160930ec9u0001t\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 COMMON SENSE\par \uc2 Business/Financial Desk; SECTB\par \b \uc2 Keep the Returns, \uc2 Trump\uc2 ; Just Give Us a Few Figures\b0\par\par\uc2 By JAMES B. STEWART \par \uc2 1,397 \uc2 words\par \uc2 30 September 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 1\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , I have a deal for you.\par \par \uc2 I know your tax returns are being audited, and you don't want to give the \uc2 Internal Revenue Service\uc2  any more ammunition.\par \par \uc2 I accept your son's representation that they run to thousands of pages and are too complicated for the average voter.\par \par \uc2 So just give us this: your adjusted gross income and actual federal taxes paid for the last five years, certified by your accountants. That's a total of 10 numbers, which would fit on a single page.\par \par \uc2 Those are numbers any taxpayer can understand. They wouldn't tell the I.R.S. anything it doesn't already know.\par \par \uc2 And while they wouldn't answer many of the questions that have swirled around your finances, they would lay to rest once and for all the most basic question: How much, if anything, do you pay in federal taxes?\par \par \uc2 The issue has taken on new urgency after this week's presidential debate, when the Democratic candidate \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  boldly suggested that \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  ''doesn't want the American people, all of you watching tonight, to know that he's paid nothing in federal taxes.''\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  hardly clarified the matter, treating Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's remark first as a compliment -- ''That makes me smart'' -- and, when questioned after the debate, asserting, ''Of course, I pay federal taxes.''\par \par \uc2 It's worth noting that this is the first time in American history that the question has had to be asked of a serious contender for the presidency.\par \par \uc2 Hopefully, it will also be the last time, if Congress finally requires all presidential candidates to release at least five years of returns, just as federal law requires presidential candidates to disclose their assets and sources of income. That would prevent the kind of time-consuming and needless speculation that Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  has generated from ever again being an issue in a national \uc2 election\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 ''I think \uc2 Trump\uc2  and all candidates should do so,'' Douglas Holtz-Eakin, an economist and tax expert, told me this week. Mr. Holtz-Eakin served as director of the Congressional Budget Office and is now president of the American Action Forum, a conservative, pro-growth advocacy group.\par \par \uc2 A chorus of prominent Republicans has said the same thing, including the former presidential candidate \uc2 Mitt Romney\uc2  -- ''It is disqualifying for a modern-day presidential nominee to refuse to release tax returns to the voters'' -- and Fred Goldberg, a former Internal Revenue Service commissioner. ''The sooner he releases his entire returns, the better,'' Mr. Goldberg told CNBC in August.\par \par \uc2 At this juncture, it's obvious that they are wasting their breath. If Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  had any intention of releasing his full returns, he would have done so by now. Thus my compromise: a modest amount of disclosure that protects Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's interests while giving voters at least some of the information they need to make an informed choice.\par \par \uc2 So far, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  has not taken me up on my offer or, as might be expected from such a veteran negotiator, made a counteroffer. Hope Hicks, a campaign spokeswoman, did not respond to my messages.\par \par \uc2 By now it should be obvious that voters want to know what's in Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's returns. A \uc2 Quinnipiac University\uc2  poll released in late August found that 74 percent of likely voters said Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  should release his tax returns. Sixty-two percent of Republicans agreed.\par \par \uc2 Contrary to his claim that people would ''learn nothing,'' there would be a wealth of relevant information of vital interest to many voters.\par \par \uc2 For starters, and assuming that any tax avoidance on his part is legal, we would know exactly what loopholes in the tax code enable someone as wealthy as Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  claims to be to pay little or no federal tax.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  has attacked loopholes that benefit others, and has called for eliminating the tax treatment of so-called carried interest, which benefits many hedge fund and private equity managers. But has he called for changing any of the provisions that benefit him?\par \par \uc2 If, as I've suggested, he and other real estate developers benefit from their ability to deduct paper losses against ordinary income and to defer capital gains taxes indefinitely through so-called like-kind exchanges, he has proposed nothing that would probably increase his own taxes.\par \par \uc2 At the very least, he has yet to explain why these loopholes for real estate developers should be retained and how they benefit the public.\par \par \uc2 It's also impossible to evaluate Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's broader tax proposals without knowing how they would affect him. Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  has called for taxing so-called ''pass through'' income, such as that generated by limited liability companies and partnerships, at a new low 15 percent rate -- far lower than the top 33 percent rate he has proposed for individuals. We know from his financial disclosure statements that most of Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's assets are held in the form of L.L.C.s and partnerships. So is this just another self-dealing benefit for Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , or is it motivated by the public interest?\par \par \uc2 There's no way to tell without seeing his tax returns.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's returns would also shed light on how aggressive his accounting has been and how close to the line of legality he has been willing to walk. As Steven M. Rosenthal, a tax lawyer and senior fellow at the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center, recently put it, ''Did \uc2 Trump\uc2  lower his taxes through legal tax avoidance, or illegal tax evasion?''\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  has never been charged with any wrongdoing, but there's a large gap between illegal behavior that can be proved beyond a reasonable doubt and what most people would consider appropriate conduct by a candidate for president. What Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  considers ''smart'' might be seen by others as evasive. ''Candidate \uc2 Trump\uc2  should follow the precedent set by every major party presidential candidate -- and president -- since Nixon and release his tax returns,'' Mr. Rosenthal said.\par \par \uc2 That Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  is being audited only strengthens the case for disclosure. Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  has repeatedly cited the audit as the reason he's not releasing his returns, as he did again during the debate. As many tax experts, including Mr. Goldberg, have pointed out, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  is free to disclose his returns even if they are being audited.\par \par \uc2 If the I.R.S. has questions about Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's tax compliance in his most recent returns, voters should know what those questions are now -- not after the \uc2 election\uc2 . (Imagine the spectacle if the I.R.S. sues a sitting president for back taxes.)\par \par \uc2 Indeed, it would have been far better if Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  had released the returns during the primaries, when Republican voters could have considered them.\par \par \uc2 Moreover, none of his arguments should prevent him from releasing earlier returns that are no longer being audited. The \uc2 Trump\uc2  campaign has said he's not being audited for returns at least before 2009. Those and even older returns would shed light on how Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  conducts his business and whether he has paid substantial federal tax.\par \par \uc2 His returns would also help assess broader questions about Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's integrity. By running a campaign that rests in large part on his claims of being a successful businessman, and, to a lesser degree, a generous donor to charitable causes, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  has put these matters in play.\par \par \uc2 There are also less tangible but no less important reasons to release the returns. Can someone who pays little or no tax, if that proves to be the case, relate to the average taxpaying American worker?\par \par \uc2 Speaking to students at \uc2 Drexel University in Philadelphia\uc2  this week, Vice President \uc2 Joseph R. Biden Jr\uc2 . responded to Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's debate interjection that not paying taxes made him ''smart.''\par \par \uc2 ''Tell that to the janitor in here who's paying taxes,'' Mr. Biden said. ''Tell that to your mothers and fathers who are breaking their neck to send you here who are paying their taxes.''\par \par \uc2 Many voters are asking: How much did Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2  pay in taxes?

Narrated by Neil deGrasse Tyson, the film explores mysterious dark matter and dark energy, and the ways scientists are working to improve their understanding of these phenomena. Every half-hour from 10:30 a.m. to 4 p.m. on weekdays, to 5 p.m. on weekends, Central Park West and 79th Street, 212-769-5200, amnh.org.\par \par \uc2 BROOKLYN HISTORICAL SOCIETY\uc2 : 'TRUMAN CAPOTE'S BROOKLYN: THE LOST PHOTOGRAPHS OF DAVID ATTIE' (continuing) Behind this new exhibition -- 40 photographs of Capote and Brooklyn Heights taken by David Attie in 1958 -- is the story of a son's rediscovery of his father's long-lost work. Mr. Attie died in 1982, when his sons were very young. One of them, the television writer Eli Attie, has spent the last few years exploring his father's archive for the first time; in the process he found photos his father had taken to accompany the Truman Capote essay ''A House on the Heights,'' which appeared in Holiday magazine in February 1959. Few of the photos were published, and the magazine included none of the Capote portraits. Now they are on view in an intimate show that feels like both a celebration of and an elegy for an unrefined Brooklyn that once earned the provocative opening line in Capote's essay: ''I live in Brooklyn. By choice.'' 128 Pierrepont Street, near \uc2 Clinton\uc2  Street, Brooklyn Heights, 718-222-4111, brooklynhistory.org.\par \par \uc2 INTREPID SEA, AIR & SPACE MUSEUM: 'ON THE LINE: INTREPID AND THE VIETNAM WAR' (continuing) Visitors familiar with this museum are likely to be well aware of its flight deck, perhaps even some of its wartime history. During the Vietnam War, the Intrepid served three tours overseas, between 1966 and 1969. Now, in an exhibition set in the space where crew members lived and worked, the museum tells their stories with artifacts, film clips and photographs. Pier 86, 46th Street and 12th Avenue, \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , 877-957-7447, intrepidmuseum.org.\par \par \uc2 NEW YORK PUBLIC LIBRARY\uc2 : '\uc2 ALEXANDER HAMILTON\uc2 : STRIVER, STATESMAN, SCOUNDREL' (through Dec. 31) It's the New York Public Library's turn to take advantage of ''Hamilton''-mania. This exhibition, made from the library's collection, provides some answers to that question posed at the beginning of Lin-Manuel Miranda's hit musical about the ''founding father without a father,'' \uc2 Alexander Hamilton\uc2 : ''How does a bastard, orphan, son of a whore and a Scotsman, dropped in the middle of a forgotten spot in the Caribbean by providence, impoverished, in squalor, grow up to be a hero and a scholar?'' Stephen A. Schwarzman Building, New York Public Library, 917-275-6975, nypl.org/events/exhibitions/hamilton.\par \par \uc2 RUBIN MUSEUM OF ART: 'SACRED SPACES' (through Oct. 17) This exhibition's premise is a question: What is a sacred space? It could be the museum's Tibetan Buddhist Shrine Room, a traditional space for prayer and meditation. Or it could be a panoramic vista in the Himalayas. It could even be a video installation about Jain devotional rituals. All are on view in this exploration of veneration and its venues. 150 West 17th Street, Chelsea, 212-620-5000, rubinmuseum.org.\par \par \uc2 'SEE HOW THEY RAN! F,D,R, AND HIS OPPONENTS: CAMPAIGN TREASURES FROM THE \uc2 NEW-YORK HISTORICAL SOCIETY\uc2 ' (through Nov. 30) This \uc2 election\uc2  exhibition highlights the ''new media'' of Franklin D. Roosevelt's era. We have \uc2 Twitter\uc2  and Snapchat selfies; voters in the 1930s and '40s had campaign buttons and radio broadcasts. The show includes those political oldies, along with broadsides, popular music and posters, including one with a vivid original painting by the artist Ben Shahn. Roosevelt House Public Policy Institute at Hunter College, 47-49 East 65th Street, between Madison and Park Avenues, Upper East Side, 212-650-3174, roosevelthouse.hunter.cuny.edu; free.\par \par \uc2 Events\par \par \uc2 ARCHITECTURE & DESIGN FILM FESTIVAL (through Sunday) This niche, but informative, festival began on Wednesday and continues through the weekend with a lineup that looks to architecture's past -- ''Peter Behrens: A Pioneer in Architecture'' (Friday at 9:15 p.m.) and ''Eero Saarinen: The Architect Who Saw the Future'' (Sunday at 8:30 p.m.) -- as well as the present, including a program that explores the homes of contemporary architects, ''Where Architects Live'' (Saturday at 5:30 p.m. and Sunday at 3 p.m.). More information at adfilmfest.com. At various times, Cin\u233\'00\'E9polis Chelsea, 260 West 23rd Street.\par \par \uc2 ARCHTOBER (Saturday through Oct. 31) Tours, talks, exhibitions -- it's difficult to keep track of all the events going on during New York's annual monthlong celebration of architecture and design. Each day features a ''building of the day,'' with a tour. Make reservations early; coveted tours, like one of the Lowline underground-park site, are already sold out. You can still get into a tour of the New York State Pavilion, designed by \uc2 Philip Johnson\uc2  for the 1964-65 World's Fair in Flushing, Queens (Thursday at noon). Other highlights for the coming week include daily architecture boat tours and ''The Stories They Tell: Trees of Steel,'' a lecture about the architectural history of the World Trade Center site (Monday at noon, National September 11 Memorial & Museum). More information at archtober.org.\par \par \uc2 GRUB STREET FOOD FESTIVAL (Saturday) This tasting event -- put on by New York magazine's food website, Grub Street -- returns to the Hester Street Fair on the Lower East Side with more than 50 vendors. Come with an empty stomach and clear priorities: Among the restaurants taking part are indulgent gems like Melt Bakery, Babu Ji and Red Hook Lobster Pound. A Heineken-sponsored beer garden will broadcast college football (for those so inclined), and live music will be performed throughout the day. From 11 a.m. to 5 p.m., Essex Street at Hester Street, Lower East Side, grubstreet.com; free.\par \par \uc2 OPEN DOORS TOUR (Saturday) The ornate 19th-century mausoleums of Green-Wood open their dusty doors for this self-guided walk on the cemetery grounds. Docents will be on hand to explain the family histories behind Green-Wood's most distinctive residents. Among them are John Taylor Johnston, the founding president of the \uc2 Metropolitan Museum of Art\uc2  who resides in an Egyptian revival tomb, and Joseph C. Hoagland, whose mausoleum ceiling is decorated with dazzling mosaic tiles. Fifth Avenue and 25th Street, Greenwood Heights, Brooklyn, 718-768-7300, green-wood.com/toursevents.\par \par \uc2 Spoken Word\par \par \uc2 IMAGINING JERUSALEM: THE GOLDEN CITY IN ART, LORE AND LITERATURE SERIES (Wednesday) Adam Gopnik, the beloved New Yorker writer and critic, hosts this series tied to the \uc2 Metropolitan Museum of Art\uc2 's exhibition ''Jerusalem 1000--1400: Every People Under Heaven,'' on view through Jan. 8. In the opening talk, ''Jerusalem & Athens: A Tale of Two Cities,'' Mr. Gopnik plans to set the stage for discussions by lecturing on Jerusalem's history of arguments over faith and reason. At 6:30 p.m., Grace Rainey Rogers Auditorium, \uc2 Metropolitan Museum of Art\uc2 , 212-535-7710, metmuseum.org/tickets.\par \par \uc2 WOMEN OF LETTERS (Wednesday) This literary salon, hosted by the writer Sofija Stefanovic, returns for a third season with an evening dedicated to the theme ''a letter to my childhood dream.'' Among the guests are the actress and poet Amber Tamblyn; Laura Gomez of ''Orange Is the New Black''; and Zerlina Maxwell, a media director with \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's presidential campaign. At 7 p.m., Joe's Pub, at the \uc2 Public Theater\uc2 , 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, 212-967-7555, joespub.com.\par \par \uc2 Walking Tours\par \par \uc2 LONG ISLAND CITY TOURS: QUEENS COOL UNCOVERED (Sunday) The idea behind this tour is that it's high time Queens got more attention, starting with Long Island City. The tour includes highlights of the neighborhood's history and arts scene, with stops at galleries and crafts and food vendors. The meeting location is given at registration. At 2:30 p.m., 347-628-2088, bqetours.com.\par \par \uc2 BROADWAY UP CLOSE: 'ACT I' (daily) Broadway Up Close's flagship tour takes participants through the history of Manhattan's theater district, from its origins in the 1880s to this season's hits. Highlights include 42nd Street itself, ghost stories and theaters where history was made -- including the Nederlander, where the tour begins and where the musical ''Rent'' introduced changes (like ticket lotteries) that remain popular today. At 11 a.m., beginning at 208 West 41st Street, Manhattan, 917-841-0187, broadwayupclose.com. Reservations are required.\par \par \uc2 PUBLIC ART OF LOWER MANHATTAN: AN OUTDOOR GALLERY HIDING IN PLAIN VIEW (Sunday) The roster of artists whose large-scale works dot the plazas and parks of the Financial District includes many you would see at institutions like the Met or \uc2 the Museum of Modern Art\uc2 . This tour, led by Patrick Waldo, highlights art by Isamu Noguchi, Jean Dubuffet and Louise Nevelson, for example. At 2 p.m. The meeting location is available upon registration. 212-935-3960, mas.org.\par \par \uc2 (PHOTOGRAPHS BY ATISHA PAULSON/NEW YORK MAGAZINE) \par \par \uc2 Document NYTF000020160930ec9u00075\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 OP-ED CONTRIBUTOR\par \uc2 Editorial Desk; SECTA\par \b \uc2 An Uncharitable Foundation\b0\par\par\uc2 By LINDA SUGIN \par \uc2 968 \uc2 words\par \uc2 30 September 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 27\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 In addition to being the Republican nominee for president, \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2  is president of the relatively small \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2  Foundation\uc2  and chairman of the relatively large \uc2 Trump\uc2  Organization\uc2 . Although the foundation is a charitable organization, it appears to have been used for less than charitable purposes.\par \par \uc2 According to exhaustive reporting by David A. Fahrenthold of The \uc2 Washington Post\uc2 , Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  may have used the foundation to pay expenses for his business, to buy himself gifts and to make a political contribution. These things are all clearly prohibited under both federal and state charities law. No competent lawyer would advise a charitable foundation that such payments were allowable, and only someone with no respect for charity would so flagrantly violate these basic rules.\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 Internal Revenue Service\uc2  and state regulators do not have the resources to investigate every charity for wrongdoing. They depend on the honesty of the people who control charities and the lawyers and accountants who advise them. Effective government oversight depends on disclosures by charitable organizations that point to possible violations. Since charities do not need to pay tax on their income, the primary function of the forms they file with the I.R.S. and the states is simply to disclose information that helps the government administer the law.\par \par \uc2 Misrepresentation by charities stymies enforcement. If not for Mr. Fahrenthold's reporting, neither the public nor the government might ever have known that Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  most likely used the foundation as a personal piggy bank.\par \par \uc2 Charities can depend on the I.R.S. to highlight relevant legal issues, and thereby educate charity managers about their fiduciary obligations. You don't need to be a lawyer to realize that the payments reportedly made by Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's foundation are forbidden: The I.R.S.'s Form 990-PF, which all foundations are required to file, flags the issues by posing pointed questions about improper activities.\par \par \uc2 For example, the form asks if the foundation spent ''more than $100 during the year (either directly or indirectly) for political purposes'' The \uc2 Trump\uc2  Foundation answered no on its filing for 2013, even though it had made a $25,000 political donation that year.\par \par \uc2 Three other questions also inquire about political expenditures. Nevertheless, the foundation declined to mention that contribution, made to a group supporting the 2014 re-\uc2 election\uc2  campaign of Pam Bondi, the attorney general of Florida. A \uc2 Trump\uc2  organization official told The Post that the contribution was made in error and that Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  had paid a $2,500 excise tax in connection with it.\par \par \uc2 Similarly, the annual form asks several questions about whether a foundation has been involved in ''self-dealing'' transactions -- which include those in which the people who control a charity use its funds for their own benefit. If the foundation's board members did not know what activities constituted self-dealing transactions, the form lists them in the questions. The foundation answered no to all of them; Mr. Fahrenthold's reporting, however, has revealed such transactions in more than one year. Consequently, the filings fail to reveal that the foundation paid to settle a lawsuit that arose out of Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's business and that it bought a collectible football helmet and a painting of Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  that would hang in one of his hotels.\par \par \uc2 For these reasons, the foundation's tax returns contain clear misrepresentations. An officer or trustee of every foundation must sign the returns ''under penalties of perjury.'' Given the explicit questions that the tax form asks, it is hard to believe that the foundation omitted so much relevant information by mistake. The foundation's governing board consists of Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 ; his children Donald Jr., Eric and Ivanka; and a \uc2 Trump\uc2  Organization\uc2  employee. They were advised by an accounting firm, to which the foundation paid a $5,000 fee in recent years. If the \uc2 Trump\uc2  family failed to understand the questions, their accountants could have explained.\par \par \uc2 While most charity board members are loyal fiduciaries serving the public good, some abuse the trust that society places in these institutions. The rules for private foundations are strict: Congress was worried that wealthy individuals would use their foundations for private gain. At the same time, the rules encourage the great generosity of philanthropists.\par \par \uc2 The law demands transparency to make sure charitable organizations deserve the favorable tax treatment they receive. While Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  has refused to release his personal tax returns for public inspection, investigation of the foundation's returns show that he has not been forthcoming with the tax authorities.\par \par \uc2 The foundation's returns also tell us something about Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's charitable giving, which his personal returns would more fully reveal: He may not be very generous. Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's most recent contribution to the foundation was $30,000 in 2008. No member of the \uc2 Trump\uc2  family has made a donation since. The candidate may have given to other charities directly, but he will have to release his personal returns for voters to know for sure.\par \par \uc2 Violations of these rules are an affront to all charities. The I.R.S. and the attorney general of New York, Eric Schneiderman, who is investigating the foundation to determine whether it complied with state law, should hold it to the highest standard. If the reported violations prove true, the foundation does not deserve its charitable or tax-exempt status.\par \par \uc2 Americans who give to, volunteer with, or depend on charities should know that politicking and self-dealing by charities are never acceptable. The candidate's apparent disregard for the law does not bode well for a \uc2 Trump\uc2  administration.\par \par \uc2 Follow The \uc2 New York Times\uc2  Opinion section on \uc2 Facebook\uc2  and \uc2 Twitter\uc2  (@NYTOpinion), and sign up for the Opinion Today newsletter.\par \par \uc2 Linda Sugin is a law professor at Fordham University.\par \par \uc2 Document NYTF000020160930ec9u00077\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 National Desk; SECTA\par \b \uc2 Ohio Has Lost Its Spotlight in Campaign\b0\par\par\uc2 By JONATHAN MARTIN \par \uc2 1,721 \uc2 words\par \uc2 30 September 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 1\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 ATHENS, Ohio -- After decades as one of America's most reliable political bellwethers, an inevitable presidential battleground that closely mirrored the mood and makeup of the country, Ohio is suddenly fading in importance this year.\par \par \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  has not been to the state since Labor Day, and her aides said Thursday that she would not be back until next week, after a monthlong absence, effectively acknowledging how difficult they think it will be to defeat \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2  here. Ohio has not fallen into step with the demographic changes transforming the United States, growing older, whiter and less educated than the nation at large.\par \par \uc2 And the two parties have made strikingly different wagers about how to win the White House in this \uc2 election\uc2 : Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , the Republican nominee, is relying on a demographic coalition that, while well tailored for Ohio even in the state's Democratic strongholds, leaves him vulnerable in the more diverse parts of the country where Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  is spending most of her time.\par \par \uc2 It is a jarring change for political veterans here, who relish being at the center of the country's presidential races: Because of newer battleground states, Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  can amass the 270 electoral votes required to win even if she loses Ohio.\par \par \uc2 ''Their map is a little different, and Ohio is not as crucial as it once was,'' conceded James Ruvolo, a former chairman of the Ohio Democratic Party who lives in the Toledo area, a Democratic bulwark that Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  has not visited once this year. ''They'll keep putting in money, but I don't think they're going to put a lot of her time in here.''\par \par \uc2 Ohio has long basked in the presidential spotlight. Every four years, fall would bring frequent candidate visits, ceaseless television commercials and breathless, county-by-county tallies of its voting returns late into \uc2 election\uc2  night. Democrats in the state became used to rock-concert-style rallies, like the ones \uc2 John Kerry\uc2  staged in Cleveland and Columbus with Bruce Springsteen in 2004 and President Obama held at Ohio State to kick off his 2012 re-\uc2 election\uc2  campaign. Mr. Obama held five events over three trips to Ohio in September 2012 alone.\par \par \uc2 And it was all for good reason: No candidate of either party has won the White House without carrying Ohio since John F. Kennedy in 1960.\par \par \uc2 But its Rust Belt profile, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's unyielding anti-trade campaign and Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's difficulty energizing Ohio's young voters have made it a lesser focus for Democrats this year, even as it remains critical to Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's path to the White House. As Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's aides privately note, the demographic makeup of Florida, Colorado and North Carolina, which have a greater percentage of educated or nonwhite voters, makes those states more promising for Democrats in a contest in which the electorate is sorted along bright racial and economic lines.\par \par \uc2 And with a once-competitive Senate race in Ohio turning into a rout for Rob Portman, the Republican incumbent, Democrats can quietly pull back from the state with little fear of down-ballot consequences.\par \par \uc2 As the place where Appalachia meets the Midwest, and where industrial centers arose not far from a vast farm belt, Ohio has prided itself on being a version of America writ small. Its immigration patterns reflected that, with New Englanders resettling here, followed by Germans and Eastern Europeans. At the same time, Southerners, white and black, crossed the Ohio River in search of freedom and opportunity.\par \par \uc2 But even some of the state's proudest boosters acknowledge that Ohio, which is nearly 80 percent white, is decreasingly representative of contemporary America.\par \par \uc2 ''Ohio, like a melting iceberg, has slowly been losing its status as the country's bellwether,'' said Michael F. Curtin, a Democratic state legislator and former Columbus Dispatch editor who is an author of the state's authoritative ''Ohio Politics Almanac.''\par \par \uc2 He continued: ''It's a slow melt. But we have not captured any appreciable Hispanic population, and there has been very little influx of an Asian population. When you look at the diversity of America 30 to 40 years ago, Ohio was a pretty close approximation of the country. It no longer is.''\par \par \uc2 What is less clear than the racial trends is whether the state will continue to grow more forbidding for Democrats in future presidential races.\par \par \uc2 That could be determined by the choices the national parties make after the \uc2 election\uc2 , particularly whether Republicans continue Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's project of shifting from a business-friendly to a more populist approach on immigration and trade.\par \par \uc2 ''If the Republican Party looks more like the \uc2 Trump\uc2  coalition and the Democratic Party looks more like the Obama coalition, then the states Democrats must win will no longer be Ohio and Iowa,'' said David Wilhelm, a manager of \uc2 Bill \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's first presidential campaign and a former Democratic national chairman who lives in suburban Columbus. ''They will be Virginia, North Carolina, Arizona and Georgia.''\par \par \uc2 Yet that same Obama coalition was enough to hand the president a two-point victory in Ohio in 2012, when the state's demographics were no less challenging for Democrats. The difference now, Ohio voters and strategists from both parties say, is in the two candidates and the issues at hand.\par \par \uc2 Facing \uc2 Mitt Romney\uc2 , who was easily caricatured as a country club Republican, Mr. Obama battered him as a handmaiden for the wealthy and criticized his opposition to the auto bailout, which lifted Mr. Obama with white union Democrats in car-making communities around Youngstown and Toledo.\par \par \uc2 But this year, Republicans have put forward a candidate whose views on trade are indistinguishable from, if not more hard-line than, the A.F.L.-C.I.O.'s.\par \par \uc2 ''Republicans used to run on God and guns,'' Mr. Ruvolo said. ''Well, \uc2 Trump\uc2  added a third element: trade.''\par \par \uc2 Paired with Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's jeremiads about immigrants' taking American jobs, it makes for a powerful combination in a state that has suffered from the decline of manufacturing. Though he lost the Ohio primary to Gov. John Kasich, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  still carried a stretch of counties along the eastern spine of the state, its most economically depressed region, where thousands of industrial and coal-mining jobs have been lost. Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  is expected to pile up significant margins in those counties in November.\par \par \uc2 Some political veterans speak with wonder about private polls showing Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  leading even in bedrock Democratic communities. ''I see, at best, lack of enthusiasm in traditional Democratic areas,'' said Dennis E. Eckart, a former Democratic congressman from suburban Cleveland.\par \par \uc2 Mike Dawson, a Republican strategist who runs a website on Ohio's political history, said Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  would be competitive in two counties in Youngstown's Mahoning Valley that the Democratic presidential candidate has carried in every \uc2 election\uc2  for 60 years with the exception of 1972.\par \par \uc2 It is no coincidence that the same region kept re-electing Representative James A. Traficant Jr. from 1985 to 2002, despite his routine flouting of ethics. Mr. Traficant, a longtime Democrat who died in 2014, was known for mixing inflammatory rhetoric, a squirrel-like toupee and a hard-edge populism.\par \par \uc2 ''There is not a dime's worth of difference, as George Wallace once said, between Jim Traficant and \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2 ,'' said Mr. Eckart, whose district abutted Mr. Traficant's. ''They say anything, do anything, just act outrageous, and people just kind of like that.''\par \par \uc2 Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  remains strongest in the more affluent and educated areas around Ohio's population centers -- Cleveland, Columbus and Cincinnati -- where some voters who backed Mr. Romney four years ago are appalled by Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Emily Huber, a 29-year-old evangelical Christian and loyal Republican in Columbus, is one of them. As she sold candles and jewelry made by victims of sex trafficking at a farmer's market in the shadow of the state capitol, Ms. Huber said she and her husband were unsure whether they could back Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  because of offensive comments that she said ''show his true character.''\par \par \uc2 What will determine who wins Ohio, said Representative Steve Stivers, a Republican, is if ''Hillary can pick up a bunch of voters in the suburbs to offset the rural and some of the industrial areas.''\par \par \uc2 Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  has an organizational advantage, with 60 offices across the state, and is flooding Ohio with surrogates: \uc2 Bill \uc2 Clinton\uc2  is expected in the state on a bus tour next week. But her campaign is sensitive about her absence, which has become a local topic of discussion. After this article was published online, it hurried to announce that she would return on Monday, but without specifying which city she would visit.\par \par \uc2 A \uc2 Clinton\uc2  victory in Ohio may also require rousing younger voters, which is in doubt. When a group of Democratic Ohio mayors campaigned recently for Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  in Athens -- home of \uc2 Ohio University\uc2  and seat of the county with the state's largest percentage of millennials -- they drew little interest.\par \par \uc2 As students stopped at sidewalk A.T.M.s to prepare for parents weekend, they expressed only lukewarm support for Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 . Paula Atfield, a freshman from Cleveland, said she was voting for Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  because ''she's not \uc2 Trump\uc2 ,'' but added that the \uc2 election\uc2  was seen as ''a joke'' on campus.\par \par \uc2 ''Neither of them are suitable,'' she said. ''Most people aren't even voting.''\par \par \uc2 At a news conference earlier in the day, the Dayton mayor, Nan Whaley, had declared that the state would send Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  to the White House. ''Ohio is the decider of presidents,'' she said.\par \par \uc2 But now, Ms. Whaley sounded less bullish. ''I think it's crucial,'' she said of a \uc2 Clinton\uc2  victory in Ohio, before quickly adding of Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , ''It's just not as crucial as his.''\par \par \uc2 Find out what you need to know about the 2016 presidential race today, and get politics news updates via \uc2 Facebook\uc2 , \uc2 Twitter\uc2  and the First Draft newsletter.\par \par \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2  in Canton, Ohio, this month.

\par\par \uc2 National Desk; SECTA\par \b \uc2 In Hacked Audio, \uc2 Clinton\uc2  Rethinks an Obama Plan\b0\par\par\uc2 By DAVID E. SANGER and WILLIAM J. BROAD \par \uc2 1,036 \uc2 words\par \uc2 30 September 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 17\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 WASHINGTON -- \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  expressed doubts about whether the United States should go forward with a trillion-dollar modernization of its nuclear forces at a fund-raiser in February, questioning an Obama administration plan that she has remained largely silent on in public.\par \par \uc2 Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  also suggested she would be far tougher against foreign nations that hack into American computer networks and would kill one of the Pentagon's pet projects, a nuclear-tipped cruise missile.\par \par \uc2 ''The last thing we need,'' she told the audience, ''are sophisticated cruise missiles that are nuclear armed.''\par \par \uc2 Her comments were contained in an audio recording of the fund-raiser that appeared on the website of The Washington Free Beacon, a conservative publication, which said it was gleaned from the hack of a campaign staff member. But it said nothing about who did the hacking.\par \par \uc2 At a moment when Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  and the Obama administration have warned that Russia is trying to influence the American \uc2 election\uc2 , the mysterious release of the tape is also certain to raise new questions about the scope of attacks on the \uc2 Democratic National Committee\uc2  and the \uc2 Clinton\uc2  campaign.\par \par \uc2 A former \uc2 Defense Department\uc2  official present at the fund-raiser, Andrew C. Weber, who raised the question about nuclear modernization, verified the contents of the tape, but also suggested its release was part of the same hacking campaign that exposed D.N.C. emails.\par \par \uc2 Before she turned to nuclear matters, Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  used the fund-raiser to suggest that she would be much firmer against foreign nations that hack into American networks. Though the administration never formally accused China of stealing the security-review records of nearly 22 million federal employees and contractors, she called the theft ''a gold mine for Chinese intelligence.''\par \par \uc2 ''They are at it all the time,'' she said of the Chinese state-sponsored hackers. But she also seemed to suggest -- more directly than she did in Monday night's debate -- that she thinks the best deterrent to the Russians, the Chinese, the Iranians and the North Koreans, all of whom she named, was a dose of American offensive cyberweaponry.\par \par \uc2 ''They have physical assets that are also connected on the internet,'' she said. ''So they have to know we would retaliate. So that provides a certain level of deterrence.''\par \par \uc2 It may not: The Russian-backed hacks of the Democrats' infrastructure, so far without a visible American response, suggest that the deterrence Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  is relying on is not working.\par \par \uc2 The 50-minute recording was made in February during a fund-raising event at the home of Beatrice and Anthony Welters in McLean, Va. Mrs. Welters was ambassador to Trinidad and Tobago when Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  was secretary of state.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Weber was an assistant secretary of defense for nuclear programs from 2009 to 2014. Last year, after leaving office, he joined \uc2 William J. Perry\uc2 , a secretary of defense in the administration of President \uc2 Bill \uc2 Clinton\uc2  and one of the Democratic Party's most influential nuclear advisers, to write an op-ed in The \uc2 Washington Post\uc2  strongly opposing White House approval of an upgraded nuclear cruise missile.\par \par \uc2 The missile is part of a sweeping modernization of the American nuclear arsenal that is estimated to cost up to $1 trillion over three decades. Undertaken by the Obama administration, it features new factories, refurbished nuclear arms, and a new generation of weapon carriers, including bombers, missiles and submarines. The new bombers are to carry the new cruise missile.\par \par \uc2 At the fund-raiser, Mr. Weber asked Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  about the modernization push and whether she, as president, would cancel the cruise missile, which he called a ''particularly destabilizing, dangerous type of nuclear weapon.''\par \par \uc2 ''I certainly would be inclined to do that,'' she answered. ''The last thing we need are sophisticated cruise missiles that are nuclear-armed.''\par \par \uc2 Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  went beyond the question to warn of an emerging nuclear arms race, naming Russia and China as well as Pakistan and India. ''This is one of the most dangerous developments imaginable,'' she told the audience.\par \par \uc2 ''Pakistan is running full speed to develop tactical nukes in their continuing hostility with India.'' she said. ''But we live in fear that they're going to have a coup, that jihadists are going to take over the government, they're going to get access to nuclear weapons, and you'll have suicide nuclear bombers. So, this could not be a more threatening scenario.''\par \par \uc2 The United States, Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  said, needs to ''do everything we can'' to restrain the competitions, including exploring new treaties with Moscow that would go beyond the New Start treaty of 2010, which she helped negotiate.\par \par \uc2 Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  proceeded to praise Mr. Perry, saying the more he spoke out publicly and joined with Republican statesmen in trying to curb nuclear arms, ''the better off we'll be in trying to really cut this off.'\par \par \uc2 ''This is going to be a big issue,'' she added. ''It's not just the nuclear-tipped cruise missile. There's a lot of other money we're taking about to go into refurbishing and modernization.''\par \par \uc2 ''Do we have to do any of it?'' Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  asked. ''If we have to do some of it, how much do we have to do? That's going to be a tough question, so I will look to people like you and \uc2 Bill Perry\uc2  to help me answer that question.''\par \par \uc2 Mr. Obama has said he wants to reduce the role of nuclear weapons in American strategy, and his aides have hinted he may believe the modernization program needs reconsideration. But he seems to have left that to his successor, and the cruise missile Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  spoke about so disparagingly remains in the Pentagon budget.\par \par \uc2 Find out what you need to know about the 2016 presidential race today, and get politics news updates via \uc2 Facebook\uc2 , \uc2 Twitter\uc2  and the First Draft newsletter.\par \par \uc2 William J.

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 When presented with the opportunity to move past a difficult news cycle, \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2  has struggled to do so throughout the campaign.\par \par \uc2 The topic of Alicia Machado proved no exception for Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  and his team on Wednesday. \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  invoked Ms. Machado, the 1996 winner of the Miss Universe pageant, which Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  used to own, during the first general \uc2 election\uc2  debate Monday night to illustrate the Republican nominee's disparaging comments about women.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , Ms. Machado has said, called her ''Miss Piggy'' for gaining weight after winning the crown.\par \par \uc2 Most politicians would find a way to move away from a damaging story line. But Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  has dug in for two days, as have his supporters, on the notion that he did nothing wrong -- and that a Miss Universe should not gain weight in the first place. One of those surrogates, \uc2 Newt Gingrich\uc2 , the former House speaker, has struggled with his own weight.\par \par \uc2 So, for that matter, has Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , who conceded on ''The Dr. Oz Show'' while discussing his health that he needs to lose weight.\par \par \uc2 None of this seems helpful to Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  as he is facing a historically wide gender gap.

\par\par \uc2 CONGRESSIONAL MEMO\par \uc2 National Desk; SECTA\par \b \uc2 Progress? It Depends on the Party That's Talking\b0\par\par\uc2 By JENNIFER STEINHAUER; Emmarie Huetteman contributed reporting. \par \uc2 1,110 \uc2 words\par \uc2 30 September 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 12\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 WASHINGTON -- To be fair, Congress averted a government shutdown a full two days before the lights were set to go out. So by contemporary standards, they are making great progress. There will be money to combat the Zika virus -- seven months after President \uc2 Obama\uc2  asked for it and following a predictable fight over \uc2 Planned Parenthood\uc2  -- and a promise of money to fix the water systems in Flint, Mich., at some point, probably.\par \par \uc2 In its truncated session between a seven-week summer recess and the break lawmakers are now taking before the November \uc2 election\uc2 , Congress also got a single appropriations bill to the president's desk, which would help veterans. Just 11 bills left!\par \par \uc2 Lawmakers also managed to deliver the first veto override of Mr. Obama's presidency, on a measure that would allow the families of those killed in the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks to sue Saudi Arabia for any role in the plot.\par \par \uc2 This might have been more exciting for all of them had lawmakers not raced out hours after the override to say what a terrible law they had all voted for.\par \par \uc2 But this is Congress, where the case for partisanship is upheld and defended best, and the leaders of both parties made their closing arguments on Thursday concerning who was more responsible for gridlock and which party was best positioned to lead next year.\par \par \uc2 ''The Republican Senate has been a flop'' said Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the Democratic leader, subtle and gracious as ever to his colleagues across the aisle.\par \par \uc2 For their part, Republicans on Thursday ticked through a sort of greatest hits of their legislative accomplishments since taking over the Senate in 2015. They celebrated the passage of a revised version of the No Child Left Behind education law that chipped away at reviled, high-stakes standardized school testing, a long-term infrastructure bill and legislation granting Mr. Obama enhanced power to negotiate major trade agreements.\par \par \uc2 ''I focused on the things that we had some bipartisan agreement on,'' said Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, summing up accomplishments he hopes his vulnerable incumbents can take on the road in their fall campaigns.\par \par \uc2 Working on the trade issue, he said, was ''kind of an out-of-body experience -- I was aligned with the president against Harry and Nancy,'' referring to Mr. Reid and Representative \uc2 Nancy Pelosi\uc2  of California, the House Democratic leader.\par \par \uc2 Speaker Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin echoed the accolades, adding some things he hoped that Congress could get done during the lame duck session, including criminal justice overhaul, which Mr. McConnell had said 10 minutes before would in fact not be happening. Good intentions!\par \par \uc2 Those 11 appropriations bills left also have no chance of being passed during the lame duck, so the nation should prepare for a fight over whether a big spending bill, known as an omnibus, or a series of smaller measures, referred to a minibuses, will be used to fund the government through the next fiscal year.\par \par \uc2 Republicans were pleased that they were able to get a stopgap spending bill to fund the government through Dec. 9 over the line without vast internal fights, fending off Democrats' insistence that the measure include money for Flint, which has been put off until after the \uc2 election\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 You could hear the sound of one hand clapping.\par \par \uc2 ''Averting a government shutdown with only days to spare is no reason to celebrate,'' said J. David Cox Sr., the president of the American Federation of Government Employees, a union representing 670,000 government workers. ''Congress has merely kicked the can down the road for another 10 weeks, when we will face yet another budget showdown.''\par \par \uc2 While passing a short-term spending bill without shutting down the government might seem something short of a major accomplishment, for Mr. Ryan -- who is dealing with the same tensions in his conference that helped drive out his predecessor, \uc2 John A. Boehner\uc2 , -- it is.\par \par \uc2 Rather than spend weeks entertaining impossible requests from members of his right flank and wasting time passing bills that had no chance in the Senate, Mr. Ryan simply smiled politely at them, knowing they would never vote for a short-term spending bill anyway, and took a Senate measure to the floor and cheerfully accepted help from Democrats to pass it.\par \par \uc2 Ditto for the same group's attempt to impeach the Internal Revenue Service commissioner, a move Mr. Ryan found unhelpful and which he helped make go away in exchange for a meaningless hearing.\par \par \uc2 It has not been the nastiest time on the Hill -- it's hard to get too deep in the mud when you're only at work for several weeks -- but there was still plenty of unpleasantness, often led by Mr. Reid, who had taken to the Senate floor to regularly beat on \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , the Republican presidential nominee, and by association, his Republican colleagues.\par \par \uc2 At the Democratic convention this summer, he called Mr. McConnell ''craven,'' a theme he has carried into the fall.\par \par \uc2 ''Republicans have spent their time disrespecting President \uc2 Obama\uc2  while praising \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2 . Can you imagine?'' Mr. Reid said Thursday.\par \par \uc2 When Senator Pat Toomey, Republican of Pennsylvania, tried to have a vote on anti-animal abuse legislation, Mr. Reid went to the floor to excoriate him for trying to pass that bill instead of holding a hearing on Mr. Obama's Supreme Court nominee.\par \par \uc2 Now Republicans can spend the next 40 days pretending that they don't know much about that guy \uc2 Trump\uc2  as they try mightily to hold on to the Senate, regardless of the outcome of the presidential race.\par \par \uc2 Mr. McConnell, as is his wont, refused to speak about Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  on Thursday because, as he helpfully noted, ''I choose not to.'' Mr. Ryan was kind enough to note that he hoped Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  prevailed.\par \par \uc2 Democrats will face their own problems back home as their Senate candidates, many hobbled by spending from outside groups supporting Republicans, will do their level best to fight back.\par \par \uc2 ''I think we will win the majority of the Senate,'' said Senator \uc2 Chuck Schumer\uc2 , Democrat of New York, who would become majority leader if that comes to pass. Mr. McConnell, of course, says the opposite.\par \par \uc2 See you after the \uc2 election\uc2 !\par \par \uc2 Follow The \uc2 New York Times\uc2 's politics and Washington coverage on \uc2 Facebook\uc2  and \uc2 Twitter\uc2 , and sign up for the First Draft politics newsletter.\par \par \uc2 Speaker Paul D. Ryan on Thursday, a day after he shepherded a stopgap spending bill through the House with Democrats' help.

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 This presidential \uc2 election\uc2  is a contest between the oldest of the baby boomers. Yet \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2 , 70, and \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , 68, represent two very different decades in the formation of that generation. \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  became famous as a classic 1980s type, while \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  first attained public notice as a classic 1960s type.\par \par \uc2 It's interesting, and sad, to see how the promise of those two decades has aged.\par \par \uc2 Trump\uc2  opened \uc2 Trump\uc2  Tower on Fifth Avenue in Manhattan in November 1983. Go-go capitalism had a lot of \u233\'00\'E9lan back then. Capitalism had washed away the stagnation of the 1970s. It was defeating the Soviet Union. During the Reagan years, writers celebrated capitalism not only as a wealth-generating engine but also as a moral system, a way to arouse hard work, creativity and trust.\par \par \uc2 Of course, \uc2 Trump\uc2  was always a scuzzy version of the capitalist type. Somehow I got on the guest list of a few of the '80s-era parties he hosted in the lobby of his skyscraper and would go for sociological entertainment.\par \par \uc2 They were filled with the sort of B-grade celebrities and corrupt city officials who were desperate for any mention on the front and sixth pages of The New York Post. A friend of mine came up to me at one of those parties and summarized the atmosphere: ''Not indicted, not invited.''\par \par \uc2 As we saw on Monday night, \uc2 Trump\uc2  now represents capitalism degraded to pure selfishness. He treats other people like objects and lies with abandon. Proud to be paying no taxes while others foot the bill, proud to have profited off the housing bust that caused so much suffering, he lacks even the barest conception of civic life and his responsibilities to it.\par \par \uc2 His ethos is: Get what I can for myself, and everyone else can take care of themselves. As Alexi Sargeant pointed out in First Things, ''\uc2 Trump\uc2 's policies, such as they are, usually come down to America breaking its promises.'' \uc2 Trump\uc2  would have America break its promises to its \uc2 NATO\uc2  allies, Japan, its creditors, its trading partners and its own constitution.\par \par \uc2 Trump\uc2  reminds us -- even those of us who champion capitalism -- how corrosive capitalism can be when unaccompanied by a counterbalancing ethos of moral restraint.\par \par \uc2 Rod Dreher of The American Conservative points out that when a leader consistently breaks promises, communal life is impossible. ''If you cannot count on people to honor their vows, you never know what is real,'' Dreher writes. \uc2 Trump\uc2  is the low, dishonest detritus of a once bright decade.\par \par \uc2 Clinton\uc2  gave her Wellesley commencement speech in the spring of 1969. It was filled with that '60s style of lofty, inspiring and self-important idealism.\par \par \uc2 ''The challenge now is to practice politics as the art of making what appears to be impossible possible,'' she said. ''We're not interested in social reconstruction; it's human reconstruction,'' she continued. ''We're searching for more immediate, ecstatic and penetrating modes of living.''\par \par \uc2 She dreamed of a society in which trust would be restored. ''Where you don't manipulate people. Where you're not interested in social engineering for people.'' The words were grandiose, but at least there was a spiritual ambition to them.\par \par \uc2 That poetic, aspirational quality is entirely absent from what has become the \uc2 Clinton\uc2  campaign. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  can be a devastatingly good counterpuncher, but she lacks the human touch when talking about the nation's problems, and fails to make an emotional connection.\par \par \uc2 When asked why she wants to be president or for any positive vision, she devolves into a list of programs. And it is never enough just to list three programs in an answer; she has to pile in an arid hodgepodge of eight or nine. This is pure interest-group liberalism -- buying votes with federal money -- not an inspiring image of the common good.\par \par \uc2 The twin revolutions of the 1960s and the 1980s liberated the individual -- first socially and then economically -- and weakened the community. More surprising, this boomer-versus-boomer campaign has decimated idealism.\par \par \uc2 There is no uplift in this race. There is an entire absence, in both campaigns, of any effort to appeal to the higher angels of our nature. There is an assumption, in both campaigns, that we are self-seeking creatures, rather than also loving, serving, hoping, dreaming, cooperating creatures. There is a presumption in both candidates that the lowest motivations are the most real.\par \par \uc2 Ironically, one of the tasks for those who succeed the baby boomers is to restore idealism. The great challenge of our moment is the crisis of isolation and fragmentation, the need to rebind the fabric of a society that has been torn by selfishness, cynicism, distrust and autonomy.\par \par \uc2 At some point there will have to be a new vocabulary and a restored anthropology, emphasizing love, friendship, faithfulness, solidarity and neighborliness that pushes people toward connection rather than distrust. Millennials, I think, want to be active in this rebinding. But inspiration certainly isn't coming from the aging boomers now onstage.\par \par \uc2 Follow The \uc2 New York Times\uc2  Opinion section on \uc2 Facebook\uc2  and \uc2 Twitter\uc2  (@NYTopinion), and sign up for the Opinion Today newsletter.\par \par \uc2 Document NYTF000020160930ec9u0003u\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 GRIMES, Iowa -- Betty and Dick Odgaard used to own the tiny church next door to their home. They had built it over 13 years into an art gallery, bistro, flower shop and framing service. They even rented out the chapel, with its bright stained glass windows, for social events.\par \par \uc2 But three years ago, the Odgaards refused to rent the quaint site to two gay men for a wedding, saying it would violate their religious beliefs about marriage. The men filed a civil rights complaint, and the Odgaards settled, paying a penalty because it is illegal to discriminate on the basis of sexual orientation. After the controversy, regular customers stopped coming. Friends and family members stopped speaking to them. The Odgaards were vilified as bigots and haters.\par \par \uc2 But it was not long before the Odgaards found themselves cast as heroes as well. Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, then a Republican candidate for president, visited the Odgaards' business and videotaped a sympathetic interview with them. They joined a troupe of business owners upheld as Christian martyrs in the nation's culture wars: the cake baker, the florist and the photographers who stood up for their religious beliefs and lost legal battles. They received a standing ovation at a Cruz rally and signed on as ''religious liberty ambassadors'' in his campaign.\par \par \uc2 Now, a year later, the Odgaards and other conservative evangelicals interviewed in central Iowa say they feel as if they have been abandoned. Many say that they have no genuine champion in the presidential race and that the country has turned its back on them. Americans are leaving church, same-sex marriage is the law of the land, and the country has moved on to debating transgender rights. While other Americans are anxious about the economy, jobs and terrorism, conservative Christians say they fear for the nation's very soul. Some worry that the nation has strayed so far that God's punishment is imminent.\par \par \uc2 So, in a year when many voters see nothing but bad choices, many evangelicals feel deeply torn. Long part of a reliable Republican voting bloc, many are appalled to find \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2  their only alternative to \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 . They say he has taken positions all over the map on same-sex couples and abortion and does not have the character to be president. Others are still bewildered that Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  defeated not only Mr. Cruz -- a pastor's son who made ''religious liberty'' a signature issue -- but also half a dozen other conservative Christian contenders they would have gladly supported.\par \par \uc2 Nevertheless, polls show that the vast majority of evangelicals are now coalescing around Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , largely out of fear that a President \uc2 Clinton\uc2  will appoint liberal Supreme Court justices.\par \par \uc2 'It All Flipped, So Fast'\par \par \uc2 The change in America seemed to happen so quickly that it felt like whiplash, the Odgaards said. One day, they felt comfortably situated in the American majority, as Christians with shared beliefs in God, family and the Bible. They had never even imagined that two people of the same sex could marry.\par \par \uc2 Overnight, it seemed, they discovered that even in small-town Iowa they were outnumbered, isolated and unpopular. Everyone they knew seemed to have a gay relative or friend. Mr. Odgaard's daughter from his first marriage disavowed her father's actions on \uc2 Facebook\uc2 , and his gay second cousin will not speak to him. Even their own Mennonite congregation put out a statement saying that while the denomination opposes gay marriage, ''not every congregation'' or Mennonite does. Mrs. Odgaard, 64, the daughter of a Mennonite minister, was devastated.\par \par \uc2 ''It all flipped, so fast,'' said Mr. Odgaard, a patrician 70-year-old who favors khakis and boat shoes. ''Suddenly, we were in the minority. That was kind of a scary feeling. It makes you wonder where the Christians went.''\par \par \uc2 The beginning of the end of the Odgaards' familiar life came Aug. 3, 2013, when Lee Stafford and Jared Ellars arrived at the Odgaards' gallery, G\u246\'00\'F6rtz Haus. The couple were in a panic because the hotel they had booked for their wedding had gone bankrupt two months before the date, and they had already sent the invitations out. Mr. Odgaard spent about 45 minutes showing them the property and figuring out seating, flowers and how many guests needed gluten-free meals. It was only when Mr. Odgaard asked if it was a same-sex wedding that his tone changed, they said.\par \par \uc2 ''I'll remember these words for the rest of my life,'' said Mr. Ellars, 35, a database administrator. ''He looked at us and he said, 'I can't take your money, and we don't do anything for free.'''\par \par \uc2 The couple, together for 13 years, say they never wanted the Odgaards to go out of business. They say they wanted them to stop discriminating against gay people and never put another gay couple through the rejection they experienced. The case was settled in arbitration, and the Odgaards had to pay $5,000 to Mr. Stafford and Mr. Ellars, which they donated to an anti-bullying program for gay students.\par \par \uc2 Their wedding was held in a barn, officiated by a minister with the Disciples of Christ church that Mr. Stafford attends. To this day, Mr. Stafford, who is 43 and a business systems analyst, is troubled that the debate over religious liberty appears to be ''so one-sided,'' he said.\par \par \uc2 ''Their religious beliefs say they don't approve of gay marriage, but my religious beliefs say that we can,'' he said. ''Why does their religion \uc2 trump\uc2  mine?''\par \par \uc2 'Less and Less Mainstream'\par \par \uc2 About a year ago, the Odgaards sold G\u246\'00\'F6rtz Haus to Harvest Bible Chapel, a church start-up that had been meeting in rented quarters. Its senior pastor, Ryan Jorgenson, 36, leads Sunday services in sneakers and jeans. He was trained and sent to Des Moines three years ago by a fast-growing network of conservative evangelical churches based in Elgin, Ill., that believe the Bible is God's inerrant word.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Jorgenson jumped at buying the Odgaards' picturesque property on the busiest street in Grimes, a suburb of Des Moines. He converted the lower floor, where the flower shop once stood, into a children's ministry, and installed soundproofing to insulate the children's ruckus downstairs from the electric guitars and drums of the church's worship band upstairs.\par \par \uc2 He liked the symbolism of converting a landmark site that had represented a defeat for conservative Christians into an outpost for preaching ''God's word, without apology,'' he said. The church now draws up to 300 on a weekend, and is already outgrowing the space. On a recent weekday, the secretary sat working on a stool in a hall closet. The staff was planning a conference to teach Christians how to evangelize to atheists, agnostics and Mormons.\par \par \uc2 It is necessary to train believers to hold their own, the pastor said, because ''mainstream biblical Christianity is less and less mainstream.'' On Sundays, he notices that half of his neighbors do not even go to church.\par \par \uc2 He expects that more and more Christians will, like the Odgaards, suffer ''persecution'' for their beliefs. He regularly visits the Capitol in Des Moines to pray with and lobby legislators with the Family Leader, a conservative Iowa group.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Jorgenson was among many Iowa pastors who publicly supported Mr. Cruz, though not from the pulpit, and he is not sure if he will vote for Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  in November, even though Mr. Cruz has now said he will vote for Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 . Mr. Jorgenson would not even consider voting for Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , the Democratic presidential nominee, and said he did not know anyone in his church who would. But asked how much hope he had that Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  would protect the religious liberty of conservative Christians, Mr. Jorgenson held his two fingers a quarter-inch apart.\par \par \uc2 ''My hope is not ultimately in the government,'' he said. ''I am not of this world. Jesus is going to come back. He's going to bring the perfect government. Until then, we live in a world of sin.''\par \par \uc2 Melissa and Tom Berkheimer started attending Mr. Jorgenson's church after hearing him interviewed on Christian radio. They had become frustrated that their minister ''watered down'' his sermons and never said a word about same-sex marriage even after the Iowa Supreme Court legalized it in 2009.\par \par \uc2 She is an accountant, he a chemist, and they met in a Christian chat room. They had something in common, aside from their faith: Mr. Berkheimer is half-Japanese, and Mrs. Berkheimer had lived in Japan, and her children from her first marriage are half-Japanese.\par \par \uc2 Over dinner at a steakhouse recently, the Berkheimers said they had nothing against gay people -- a refrain the Odgaards also repeatedly sounded.\par \par \uc2 ''My brother was a homosexual,'' Mrs. Berkheimer said. Her brother became a born-again Christian before he died of complications from AIDS many years ago, and she named her son after him, she said.\par \par \uc2 She said she became seriously alarmed about the nation in the past year as Congress failed to cut off funding for \uc2 Planned Parenthood\uc2  after an anti-abortion group released videos taken surreptitiously of the organization. The Berkheimers are in the ''Never \uc2 Trump\uc2 '' camp.\par \par \uc2 ''I'm worried for America if we don't turn away from abortion,'' said Mrs. Berkheimer, who is 48. ''I think our country is going to be punished, with a nuclear weapon. I don't think you can mock God forever.''\par \par \uc2 She quickly added that she was worried she would sound crazy saying such things.\par \par \uc2 'The Lesser of Two Evils'\par \par \uc2 ''The Truth'' 99.3 FM, a Christian station that features daily clips of Mr. Jorgenson's sermons, broadcasts from a drab office building in a shopping center in Des Moines. In a studio on the sixth floor, the host of a daily afternoon talk show, J. Michael McKoy, known as Mac, sat at a broad table recently facing his three co-hosts. Leaning into the microphone, he asked his listeners, ''Do you boycott businesses that go against your walk with Jesus?''\par \par \uc2 Should Christians boycott Target for announcing that transgender people could use the restrooms of their choice, he asked, or \uc2 Ikea\uc2  for a winsome ad featuring gay families? Callers' reactions were mixed. A woman said Target ''only cares about political correctness.'' A man pointed out, ''Even gay parents need furniture.''\par \par \uc2 Mr. McKoy steered the conversation to the Odgaards. He had quietly played a part in their story: When Mrs. Odgaard was in the depths of despair over a boycott of G\u246\'00\'F6rtz Haus, she often called Mr. McKoy, and he prayed with her. He introduced the Odgaards to Mr. Jorgenson, the young pastor looking for a permanent place for his church.\par \par \uc2 On air, the radio hosts suggested that the Odgaards' story showed that Americans were developing a double standard on the notion of tolerance. ''I just wish that this tolerance went across the board for Christian businesses,'' said one host, Frank Thomas Holzhauser, who on air calls himself Frank (the Verse) Thomas -- a nod to his facility with Scripture.\par \par \uc2 When the show ended, the hosts debated the \uc2 election\uc2 . Only Mr. Holzhauser said he was certain he would vote for Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , but he admitted it had caused him to lose some friends who ''can't stomach \uc2 Trump\uc2 .''\par \par \uc2 The others said they had not decided how they would vote. None had supported Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  in the Iowa caucuses. Mr. McKoy and Chris Rohloff had supported Senator \uc2 Marco Rubio\uc2 , Mr. Holzhauser had favored Ben Carson, and Bob Monserrate had backed Mr. Cruz. Mr. Rohloff said he had thought that Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  was finished last year, the moment he said at a candidates' forum in Iowa that he had never asked God for forgiveness.\par \par \uc2 ''Everyone in the room just went, 'Are you kidding me?' Even if you've never done it, you should at least know the right answer,'' Mr. Rohloff said. ''That's a fundamental thing for Christians.''\par \par \uc2 But by late September, Mr. McKoy said in a telephone interview that he and his co-hosts had decided to vote \uc2 Trump\uc2 : ''It's the lesser of two evils. And I don't know by how much.''\par \par \uc2 Some evangelicals in Iowa said Christians who praised Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  were giving Christianity a bad name. They blamed evangelicals in the South or ''Nascar Christians'' who go to church only when car races are not on.\par \par \uc2 Some Republicans are working to lift evangelicals' enthusiasm.\par \par \uc2 Before Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's arrival at Senator Joni Ernst's annual Roast and Ride in an arena at the Iowa State Fairgrounds in Des Moines last month, Steve Scheffler was working a crowd of bikers and farmers sitting on hay bales near the stage. Mr. Scheffler, the president of the Iowa Faith and Freedom Coalition, used a line borrowed from the conservative activist \uc2 Phyllis Schlafly\uc2 : ''If you're looking for a perfect candidate, you will not find Jesus Christ's name on the ballot.''\par \par \uc2 He sounded exasperated with Christians who disparaged Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 ''I hope the good Lord shows more grace to me as a sinner than these people show to \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2 ,'' he said.\par \par \uc2 'Like Losing a Child'\par \par \uc2 On a recent Sunday, the Odgaards walked into the church and sat in the rear, where Mrs. Odgaard, an artist whose paintings once filled the space, used to design frames for customers. The seats -- stackable banquet chairs that the Odgaards had bought for their wedding business -- were nearly full of mostly young worshipers. They rested their coffee cups on the hardwood floor that the Odgaards had stripped of carpet and sanded when they bought the place, spending a week on their knees. One Sunday in church, the memories were so raw that Mrs. Odgaard said she began to cry and left for home.\par \par \uc2 ''It's like losing a child,'' Mr. Odgaard said.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Jorgenson asked the congregation to stand, and the worship band struck up a catchy song called ''I'm Going Free (Jailbreak),'' played with a hoedown lilt. The lyrics were projected onto a screen placed under faded windows that Mrs. Odgaard had painted long ago to resemble stained glass. While the worshipers clapped and pumped fists in the air, the Odgaards gamely sang along: ''Jesus is my liberty. I'm going free.''\par \par \uc2 Church members were invited to stay afterward for a quarterly meeting. Dylan Knudsen, a co-pastor, made a major announcement.\par \par \uc2 Harvest Bible Chapel had just been approved for a loan to buy the Odgaards' tidy red brick house next door. The Odgaards were about to move to another town. But they planned to keep attending Harvest Bible Chapel, Mr. Knudsen said. There was brief applause.\par \par \uc2 ''Please thank them,'' Mr. Knudsen said, ''for their sacrificial role.''\par \par \uc2 Follow Laurie Goodstein @Lauriegnyt on \uc2 Twitter\uc2 .

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Most people probably can't identify any senior advisers to presidential candidates, but one member of \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's brain trust has been skywriting his name across the national news.\par \par \uc2 That would be \uc2 Rudolph W. Giuliani\uc2 , once-upon-a-time mayor of New York City.\par \par \uc2 Moving from television camera to camera as a \uc2 Trump\uc2  avatar after this week's debate, Mr. Giuliani has held forth provocatively on \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's response to former President \uc2 Bill \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's sexual behavior with a White House intern named Monica Lewinsky.\par \par \uc2 ''And after being married to \uc2 Bill \uc2 Clinton\uc2  for 20 years, if you didn't know the moment Monica Lewinsky said that \uc2 Bill \uc2 Clinton\uc2  violated her that she was telling the truth, then you're too stupid to be president,'' Mr. Giuliani said earlier this week.\par \par \uc2 In an interview on Thursday, he said that since he thought Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  was ''highly intelligent,'' he should have added: ''Or you're lying.''\par \par \uc2 Mr. Giuliani said he was not attacking Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  for Mr. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's activities, but questioning her feminist credentials. Nevertheless, he invoked decades of rumors about Mr. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's behavior and linked Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  to them in various ways -- but he introduced them with ''If true,'' and concluded, ''I'm not telling you that's true or not true.''\par \par \uc2 Perhaps the standards for decent behavior during domestic turmoil are worthy of conversation in a presidential race. If so, it is still hard to think of two people with less standing to conduct public finger-wagging than Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , whose affairs were carried out on the front pages, and Mr. Giuliani, whose second marriage came to a crashing end when, as mayor, he took an after-dinner stroll up Second Avenue with the woman who would become his third wife.\par \par \uc2 Between Mr. Giuliani and Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , their marriages outnumber the Clintons' six to one, with no shortage of the miseries that go along with domestic wreckage.\par \par \uc2 Those who lived in New York in 2000 may recall that Mr. Giuliani announced the end of his second marriage at a news conference in Bryant Park, before telling his wife at the time, Donna Hanover. When she refused to leave the mayor's official residence, where she and the two children had lived for nearly seven years, Mr. Giuliani's divorce lawyer said that someone would have ''to pry her off the chandelier to get her out of there.'' On Mother's Day, the lawyer said that Ms. Hanover was ''howling like a stuck pig.''\par \par \uc2 That ugly moment wasn't his fault, Mr. Giuliani said: His lawyer was simply responding to something his wife's lawyer had said, and had made those remarks without his authorization. ''I told him never to do it again, and he never did it again,'' Mr. Giuliani said. Nor, he added, has he ever spoken critically of his ex-wife in public.\par \par \uc2 In an interview recorded this week by a reporter with Elite Daily, a website focused on millennials, Mr. Giuliani said that he believed Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  had held back during the debate by not going after Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  harder.\par \par \uc2 After the revelation of Mr. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's relationship with Ms. Lewinsky, a 22-year-old intern, and before the president owned up to it, Ms. Lewinsky was the subject of negative stories circulated by \uc2 Clinton\uc2  surrogates. ''Instead of just being silent and supporting him if that's what you want to do, you become one of the major attackers of the person making the allegation,'' Mr. Giuliani said.\par \par \uc2 The actual public record of comments by Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  about Ms. Lewinsky is sparse, if not barren. She told a friend that her husband was to blame but also spoke disparagingly of Ms. Lewinsky, according to a private diary that was released in 2014.\par \par \uc2 During the debate Monday night, Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  quoted nasty remarks Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  had made about a young beauty pageant contestant who had gained weight.\par \par \uc2 ''You know, she made that attack on \uc2 Trump\uc2  for the way he treated women,'' Mr. Giuliani said. ''She hasn't treated women much better.''\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  renewed his insults of the beauty queen on the morning after the debate.\par \par \uc2 The leaves of Mr. Giuliani's own political career long ago browned and curled, but the \uc2 Trump\uc2  presidential campaign has offered him one more season in the sun. At the Republican National Convention in July, he spoke apocalyptically about the state of the country. ''There's, there's, there's no next \uc2 election\uc2 ,'' he said. ''This is it. There's no more time for us left to revive our great country.'' Psychologists may wonder if he was projecting onto the country the shortening calendar for his own revival.\par \par \uc2 Having served as a preparation coach for Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  ahead of the debate, Mr. Giuliani told The Associated Press afterward that he believed there was no need to adjust their approach. ''Why would we change if we won the debate?'' he asked.\par \par \uc2 Email: dwyer@nytimes.com Twitter: @jimdwyernyt\par \par \uc2 Rudolph W. Giuliani, a former mayor of New York, in 2002, after settling his second divorce. Mr. Giuliani has criticized Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  on her response to her husband's affair.

\par\par \b \uc2 A Surprise Ohio \uc2 Trump\uc2  Card\b0\par\par\uc2 By Reid J. Epstein   \par \uc2 981 \uc2 words\par \uc2 30 September 2016\par \uc2 The Wall Street Journal\par \uc2 J\par A1\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 TOLEDO, Ohio -- If \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  wins Ohio, it may be because of the groundwork laid by Rob Portman, the state's Republican senator who avoided the stage, the presidential nominee and the spotlight during the Republican Party's Cleveland convention in July.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's campaign only recently started organizing voters here -- months after Democratic rival \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  -- while Mr. Portman has for nearly two years been identifying and courting GOP voters in anticipation of a tough re-\uc2 election\uc2  race.\par \par \uc2 Consequently, Ohio may be a rare case study in reverse political coattails, with big stakes for Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 . Ohio has backed the presidential winners in the past 13 elections, and no Republican in modern history has won the White House without capturing Ohio.\par \par \uc2 In typical presidential years, the White House nominee drives party turnout for down-ticket candidates. Here, the Portman campaign, which began recruiting volunteers in high school government classes across the state in March 2015, is the primary point of contact for GOP voters.\par \par \uc2 "In Ohio, everyone is riding Rob Portman's coattails," said Donald Larson, a Republican who is challenging Democratic Rep. Marcy Kaptur.\par \par \uc2 It is an advantage that may help Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  steal a state from the Democratic column; polls show Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  and him in a dead heat. Meanwhile, Mr. Portman is leading his Democratic opponent, former Gov. Ted Strickland, by 13 percentage points, according to the Real Clear Politics average of public surveys.\par \par \uc2 While an assist from Mr. Portman, who endorsed Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  but hasn't appeared with him, could make Ohio more competitive, the GOP nominee's organizational weaknesses in other swing states such as North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin may present bigger problems.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's challenges were evident when he campaigned in Toledo last week. There was no one from the campaign in the lobby of the theater that hosted his rally asking supporters if they were registered to vote, a standard campaign tactic. Instead, John Hill, a frequent Ohio Republican Party volunteer, came on his own with a stack of voter registration forms.\par \par \uc2 At 7:15 p.m. the night after his rally, the \uc2 Trump\uc2  campaign office in Toledo was locked with no one inside. At another local \uc2 Trump\uc2  office, in suburban Perrysburg, two women sat by themselves at 8:30 p.m. The women said they weren't allowed to speak to reporters.\par \par \uc2 That same night, the \uc2 Clinton\uc2  campaign's Toledo office was buzzing with supporters, such as retired autoworker Linda Kulwicki, who was making phone calls to voters until after 10 p.m. A Portman office on Toledo's west side -- one of 11 the senator operates independently of the \uc2 Trump\uc2  campaign and the \uc2 Republican National Committee\uc2  -- also stayed open until 10 p.m.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's Ohio state director, Bob Paduchik, said \uc2 Trump\uc2  volunteers don't have to be in offices to help the campaign. He said \uc2 Trump\uc2  volunteers can make calls from their homes. "I think that we've had a much better grassroots approach here in Ohio that allows us to excite people and energize our volunteers and supporters in ways that Democrats struggle to do so," he said.\par \par \uc2 A strong turnout operation can be worth up to 3 percentage points in a close state, said \uc2 David Plouffe\uc2 , the architect of President \uc2 Barack Obama\uc2 's national campaigns. "The best way to get someone who is not sure they're going to come out is to have a human talk to them," Mr. Plouffe said.\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 Clinton\uc2  campaign has more than 300 staffers working from 57 offices in Ohio. The \uc2 Trump\uc2  campaign, which wouldn't reveal its tally of Ohio staff members, has delegated much of the nuts-and-bolts of voter outreach to the \uc2 RNC\uc2 , which has 112 staffers in the state in 31 offices it shares with local party officials and the \uc2 Trump\uc2  campaign.\par \par \uc2 "They're starting to do the things that you would see in a presidential campaign but they are behind where they should be and far behind where Secretary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  is," said John Weaver, the political strategist for Ohio's GOP Gov. John Kasich. "You need a long runway to be as effective as possible and they don't have that runway."\par \par \uc2 When a Portman volunteer canvassed likely Republican voters one afternoon last week in a well-to-do neighborhood in the Toledo suburb of Maumee, she encountered people who have been in frequent contact with the senator's campaign but have yet to hear from Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's people.\par \par \uc2 Chris Uecker, a 36-year-old pilot for Delta Air Lines, said he has voted for Republicans in each presidential \uc2 election\uc2  since 2000. He said he'd vote for Mr. Portman but isn't yet sold on Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , with whose campaign he's had no contact.\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 Clinton\uc2  campaign and the super PAC backing it, Priorities USA Action, have reserved $16.5 million in advertising time between this week and \uc2 Election\uc2  Day. Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's campaign has reserved $1.25 million on the Ohio airwaves.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Portman, meanwhile, is courting voters who don't typically vote for Republicans. Last week his campaign announced it is spending $250,000 in advertising on Spanish-language TV, even though just 3.6% of Ohioans are Hispanic. It is also advertising heavily in local newspapers that cater to Ohio's black communities.\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 Trump\uc2  campaign has a fractious relationship with Mr. Kasich, the state's popular GOP governor who defeated Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  in this year's GOP primary. He has refused to endorse Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  or vouch for him to suburban voters who remain skeptical of the nominee. Earlier this month, RNC Chairman \uc2 Reince Priebus\uc2  suggested Mr. Kasich may be barred from running for the GOP nomination for president again because he has refused to back Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 .\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=wjco20160930000133"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document J000000020160930ec9u0003f\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw272\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4080\pichgoal600

Ms. Machado is now campaigning for Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , and she told reporters Wednesday that Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  treated her like trash. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  spokesman Brian Fallon said the GOP line of attack is "a mistake that is going to backfire."\par \par \uc2 -- Beth Reinhard\par \par \uc2 ---\par \par \uc2 DEMOCRATIC CAMPAIGN\par \par \uc2 More Republicans\par \par \uc2 Back \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\par \par \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's presidential campaign announced a raft of additional prominent Republican endorsements. But among the electorate as a whole, her GOP rival \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  has about the same level of support from Republicans as Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  enjoys with Democrats.\par \par \uc2 The new endorsers offered some explanations. "\uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  has made a lot of promises. He's used very simplistic and simple language, and that is exactly what a populist does," \uc2 Carlos Gutierrez\uc2 , who served as commerce secretary under President George W. Bush, said on a conference call organized by the \uc2 Clinton\uc2  campaign. "Populism unfortunately works."\par \par \uc2 Former Rep. Claudine Schneider (R., R.I.) said she believes Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  is bringing out new Republicans and that they identify with his off-color remarks.\par \par \uc2 Both were on a list of 40 prominent Republicans who announced they are actively helping the \uc2 Clinton\uc2  campaign.\par \par \uc2 The most recent Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll found that 76% of voters who identify as Republicans are backing Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  on a four-way ballot that includes two third-party candidates. That is below 2012 Republican nominee \uc2 Mitt Romney\uc2 's performance among Republicans, but almost equal to Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's showing among Democrats this year.\par \par \uc2 -- Laura Meckler\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=wjco20160930000121"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document J000000020160930ec9u00033\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw272\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4080\pichgoal600

\par\par \b \uc2 Baffled Astrologers Demand to See \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's Birth Certificate --- To make charts, they need the exact time candidates were born; \uc2 Trump\uc2 's 'Mars vibe'\b0\par\par\uc2 By Yogita Patel   \par \uc2 965 \uc2 words\par \uc2 30 September 2016\par \uc2 The Wall Street Journal\par \uc2 J\par A1\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 There is one crucial detail \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  hasn't divulged to the American people, and it's driving Michael O'Reilly bonkers.\par \par \uc2 Mr. O'Reilly of Bend, Ore., is an astrologer. He knows \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  was born at 10:54 a.m. in Jamaica Hospital in Queens on June 14, 1946. From that, it's possible to divine that the GOP candidate "has a very strong Mars vibe going on," he says.\par \par \uc2 The red planet's position in Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's natal chart -- the precise layout of the heavens at the moment of birth -- resonates with Americans fed up with Washington, says Mr. O'Reilly. Mars exudes the Roman war god's temperament, and Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  is "basically channeling that energy."\par \par \uc2 Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  was born Oct. 26, 1947, at Edgewater Hospital in Chicago, Ill., according to the Cook County Clerk. After that, astrologers must play gumshoe to get any closer. There's decent historical evidence for two times at either end of the day. The \uc2 Clinton\uc2  campaign declined to answer questions, ensuring the mystery will continue.\par \par \uc2 "The craft of forecasting is really impossible unless we have a birth time," says Mr. O'Reilly. "But the public demands it."\par \par \uc2 Astrologers agree candidates' birth charts are critical to understand their personalities, foresee how they may respond to adversities and perhaps forecast who will win.\par \par \uc2 Natal charts are usually circular, inscribed with numbers, astrological symbols and lines representing the relationships of heavenly bodies.\par \par \uc2 At a political event in Concord, N.H., in the 1980s, New Hampshire astrologer Celeste Longacre said she approached Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , who told her she was born at 8 p.m.\par \par \uc2 The resulting evening chart, astrologers say, shows strong Gemini-Uranus influences, suggesting an erratic or unpredictable nature. Yet fast-forward the chart to 47 seconds after 8:00, and that could indicate a nurturing disposition.\par \par \uc2 New York astrologer Arlene Nimark got a different answer in 2003 at a Manhattan Barnes & Noble where the former first lady was signing her book "Living History." Others in line were asking "Are you going to run?" says Ms. Nimark. When Ms. Nimark got to the front, she asked Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  for her birth time. "Her aura was so large, and she was laughing so hard," says Ms. Nimark, "and it just rolled off her tongue: '8 a.m.'"\par \par \uc2 That time jibes with a quote astrologers often attribute to Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's mother, that her daughter was born "in time for breakfast."\par \par \uc2 The morning time astrologers often use for Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  -- 8:02, which a now-deceased seer once claimed to have confirmed, legend has it -- shows Mars in the sector that rules her career along with influences from Mercury, indicating a politically ambitious individual with a strong public presence and could also suggest she is scandal-prone. It would make her a double-Scorpio, indicating extra secretiveness.\par \par \uc2 To hedge her bets, Ms. Nimark also uses a 12-noon chart, a common practice when birth time isn't known. She expects Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  to prevail based on positive indicators in her charts and the planetary conditions on inauguration day.\par \par \uc2 Many celestial soothsayers suspect she is deliberately withholding records to throw people off. "She may herself not want to give out the exact time of birth," says Ms. Nimark. "There's always something a Scorpio is hiding. They play things close to the chest."\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  divulged his birth certificate, including birth time, to ABC News in 2011 while demanding President \uc2 Barack Obama\uc2  produce his own, as part of Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's campaign to sow doubt about the president's American status. A \uc2 Trump\uc2 -campaign spokeswoman didn't respond to inquiries.\par \par \uc2 Astrologers have been into politics for as long as politicians have been into astrology. In the 1980 presidential campaign, \uc2 Nancy Reagan\uc2  consulted astrologer Joan Quigley and passed advice to her husband's aides, Mrs. Reagan wrote in her 1989 memoir, "My Turn."\par \par \uc2 During the 1992 campaign, Shelley Ackerman, a New York astrologer, created \uc2 Bill \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's natal chart, she says, after getting his birth time on a handwritten postcard from his mother. Ms. Ackerman saw the markings of a president and a period of change centered on growth in business.\par \par \uc2 She could see his outlook wasn't completely rosy, she says, and predicted back then that "he was going to run into some very rough waters in 1997." That year, former Pentagon worker Linda Tripp began secretly taping her conversations with Monica Lewinsky.\par \par \uc2 In 2012, Phoenix astrologer Patrick Watson predicted the re-\uc2 election\uc2  of Mr. Obama -- born 7:24 p.m. Aug. 4, 1961, according to his birth certificate posted on whitehouse.gov -- after noting his chart prominently featured positive vibes from Venus, known for charm and unification, and good-fortune planet Jupiter.\par \par \uc2 Those vibes were similar to patterns in his other periods of success, including his 2008 victory over Arizona Sen. John McCain -- born at 6:25 p.m. Aug. 29, 1936, according to an unverified birth document astrologers use. A McCain spokeswoman declined to comment.\par \par \uc2 Astropolitical prognosticators can go as awry as other political pundits. This March, Mr. O'Reilly forecast a brokered July GOP convention with the eventual nominee as House Speaker \uc2 Paul Ryan\uc2  (R., Wis.), born 2:37 a.m. on Jan. 29, 1970, according to an uncertified copy of his birth certificate astrologers use. A Ryan spokesman confirmed his birth date but couldn't verify the time.\par \par \uc2 Whoever wins Nov. 8, Ms. Ackerman predicts early tumult for the next president, pointing to celestial alignments beginning around inauguration time. "The honeymoon," she says, "is over before it begins."\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=wjco20160930000117"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document J000000020160930ec9u00030\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw272\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4080\pichgoal600

\par\par \b \uc2 Election\uc2  2016: \uc2 Trump\uc2  Makes a Big Push for New Hampshire\b0\par\par\uc2 By Janet Hook   \par \uc2 463 \uc2 words\par \uc2 30 September 2016\par \uc2 The Wall Street Journal\par \uc2 J\par A4\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 BEDFORD, N.H. -- \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2 , bolstered by the endorsement of a leading Republican who once shunned him, traveled to New Hampshire for the sixth time since mid-June in a determined drive for the state's tiny cache of four electoral votes.\par \par \uc2 He went to the Granite State hard on the heels of his Democratic presidential rival, \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , who campaigned there Wednesday with Sen. Bernie Sanders. Also that day, Libertarian candidate Gary Johnson gave an MSNBC interview at the \uc2 University of New Hampshire\uc2 . And early in the week, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's running mate, Indiana Gov. Mike Pence, held a rally in Milford.\par \par \uc2 Two days before Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's arrival Thursday, his campaign trumpeted the endorsement of former New Hampshire Gov. John Sununu, who early this year had bluntly criticized the New York businessman as an "opportunist" and warned Republicans not to "drink the \uc2 Trump\uc2  Kool-Aid."\par \par \uc2 But at a rally here Thursday, Mr. Sununu urged voters to rally behind Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  for the good of the entire GOP ticket. Mr. Sununu also urged the crowd to vote for his son Chris, who is running for governor of the state.\par \par \uc2 The campaign traffic in this small state comes as polls show Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's lead narrowing here, as it has in national polls in recent weeks. It is a sign the Electoral College fight may become so close that even the state's four votes could make a difference.\par \par \uc2 "It's clear that both sides have reassessed the electoral map, and New Hampshire is back in play," said state Sen. Andy Sanborn, a former supporter of \uc2 Sen. Rand Paul\uc2 's presidential campaign who also spoke at the rally.\par \par \uc2 New Hampshire crystallizes the challenges both major party candidates face.\par \par \uc2 The state is packed with liberals and young people who backed Mr. Sanders and remain skeptical of Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 . And while she runs strongest among minority voters, New Hampshire is mostly white.\par \par \uc2 But the state is also heavy on college-educated voters, with more than one-third of people over 24 having at least a bachelor's degree, according to the latest Census data. That is a voting bloc where Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  has struggled. While Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  has made a pitch to economically struggling communities, New Hampshire's 3% unemployment rate is the second lowest in the country.\par \par \uc2 Polls have shown Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  leading Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  by sizable margins, but the gap has narrowed. The Real Clear Politics average of recent polls shows her ahead by 5.4 percentage points in New Hampshire, but that is down from a peak of 11.7 percentage points in early September.\par \par \uc2 ---\par \par \uc2 Byron Tau contributed to this article.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=wjco20160930000112"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document J000000020160930ec9u0002v\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw272\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4080\pichgoal600

\par\par \b \uc2 Election\uc2  2016: \uc2 Clinton\uc2  In Iowa For Early Voting\b0\par\par\uc2 By Byron Tau   \par \uc2 401 \uc2 words\par \uc2 30 September 2016\par \uc2 The Wall Street Journal\par \uc2 J\par A4\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 DES MOINES, Iowa -- Democratic presidential nominee \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  arrived in Iowa on Thursday for the first day of early voting there, encouraging supporters not to wait until \uc2 Election\uc2  Day to cast ballots.\par \par \uc2 "Are you ready to go to the polls? Luckily in Iowa, you can start today," Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  said, speaking in downtown Des Moines, a city that is one of the Democratic strongholds in the state. Her campaign had arranged for volunteers to direct supporters who attended her Thursday rally to a nearby early-voting site after she finished speaking.\par \par \uc2 Election\uc2  Day has been increasingly transformed from a single day in early November to an extended period of early and absentee voting that varies from state to state. In addition to her stop in Iowa this week, Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  will campaign in Ohio on Monday, the day before the state's early-voting period begins.\par \par \uc2 Based on requests for early ballots and other state voting data, the Associated Press estimates that pre-\uc2 Election\uc2  Day voting could make up 40% of all ballots cast this year, which would be an increase from the 35% of ballots cast early in 2012. That is up sharply from decades ago, when more-restrictive rules made early voting rare. Census data showed that less than 5% of people reported casting early ballots in the 1970s.\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 Clinton\uc2  campaign considers Iowa, Nevada and North Carolina the most-promising targets for its early-voting program, which has emerged as an increasingly important tool in a campaign's arsenal.\par \par \uc2 North Carolina started mail-in balloting in early September; mail-voting in Nevada started last week. Nevada and North Carolina start in-person early voting in late October.\par \par \uc2 The AP estimates that in North Carolina, 40% of the mail-in ballots that have been returned were cast by registered Democrats, compared with 35% that have been received from Republicans.\par \par \uc2 In Iowa, the hope for the \uc2 Clinton\uc2  campaign is that a significant effort to turn out supporters early could offset that fact that Iowa is expected to be one of the most-difficult swing states for Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  to win.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  also visited Iowa this week, making an appearance in Council Bluffs on Wednesday in western Iowa to rally voters in what is a largely conservative swath of the state.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=wjco20160930000110"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document J000000020160930ec9u0002t\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw272\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4080\pichgoal600

\par\par \b \uc2 Election\uc2  2016: Spending on Political Ads Slides --- Outlays for TV fall short of estimates and 2012 figures as \uc2 Trump\uc2  limits buys\b0\par\par\uc2 By Rebecca Ballhaus   \par \uc2 652 \uc2 words\par \uc2 30 September 2016\par \uc2 The Wall Street Journal\par \uc2 J\par A4\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 NEW YORK -- Spending on political advertising has followed a steady upward trend in recent decades. This year, it may fall.\par \par \uc2 Kantar Media/CMAG, a top ad-tracking agency, is forecasting that political spending on local broadcast television in 2016 will reach $2.8 billion -- about $300 million less than what was spent in 2012, and $500 million less than the agency's initial estimate for 2016.\par \par \uc2 The reason: Republican presidential candidate \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  hasn't embraced ads in the way political candidates typically have in the past.\par \par \uc2 "It's hard to grow when one party stays off TV for so long at the top of the ticket," Steve Passwaiter, vice president of Kantar's political ad monitoring unit, said in an interview.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  has aired far fewer TV ads than his rival, Democrat \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , and his predecessor, 2012 GOP nominee \uc2 Mitt Romney\uc2 . The New York businessman didn't begin airing ads in the general \uc2 election\uc2  until mid-August, while Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  was on the air all summer. Last month, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  spent $5 million on ads, compared with Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's $32 million.\par \par \uc2 In 2012, Mr. Romney and his allied super PACs spent $550 million on political advertising in the general \uc2 election\uc2 , Mr. Passwaiter said. Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  and his backers have so far spent $78 million.\par \par \uc2 Helping Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  not have to pay for ads is the robust coverage his campaign has gotten from the networks. The media tracker mediaQuant estimates that in the past year, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  has received $4.6 billion worth of free media coverage, compared with Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's $2.4 billion.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's campaign recently said it planned to air $100 million in TV ads before \uc2 Election\uc2  Day, and has so far reserved about $20 million in airtime, according to a media buyer. At the end of August, his campaign had $50 million in the bank.\par \par \uc2 His resistance to TV ad spending has taken a toll on broadcasters. Earlier this month, \uc2 Sinclair Broadcast Group Inc\uc2 . withdrew its political-spending forecast for the year, sending stocks across the broadcast industry lower.\par \par \uc2 Sinclair said it has yet to see significant advertising spending on the race. As recently as August, the company was forecasting a record year for campaign spending. \uc2 Gray Television Inc\uc2 ., which owns stations in 51 markets, also withdrew its guidance for political-advertising revenue for the rest of the year.\par \par \uc2 Speaking on Thursday at a conference hosted by the \uc2 Television Bureau of Advertising\uc2 , an association of TV broadcasters, Mr. Passwaiter said Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  also has spent less than her predecessor, President \uc2 Barack Obama\uc2 . She and her allies have so far spent $325 million on TV ads, compared with Mr. Obama's $500 million over the course of the 2012 \uc2 election\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 "She probably figures, 'Why do I have to spend more?'" Mr. Passwaiter said, given her "overwhelming" advantage on the air.\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 Trump\uc2  campaign has noted that despite Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's hefty advertising, her lead in most polls has shrunk in recent weeks.\par \par \uc2 Overall, political spending on TV in 2016 is forecast to total about $3.2 billion, down 4% from 2012, according to Marci Ryvicker, managing director at Wells Fargo Securities. While the share of advertising dollars spent on broadcast TV is expected to remain constant -- at 53% -- spending on digital is forecast to double, to 19% from 10%.\par \par \uc2 Local cable TV may see an increase in political spending this year, Mr. Passwaiter said -- to $750 million, compared with $600 million four years ago.\par \par \uc2 Broadcasters appeared to hold out hope that Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's media strategy wouldn't be a long-lasting trend. In a survey, Mr. Passwaiter said, 70% of the association's members said the \uc2 Trump\uc2  strategy was a "fad."\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=wjco20160930000108"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document J000000020160930ec9u0002r\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 Foreign Desk; SECTA\par \b \uc2 Fate of British Labour Party May Be in Leftist Group's Hands\b0\par\par\uc2 By STEVEN ERLANGER and STEPHEN CASTLE \par \uc2 1,334 \uc2 words\par \uc2 29 September 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 8\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 LIVERPOOL, England -- Jackie Walker, a prominent left-wing activist, was in full flow. ''We're part of the biggest political moment in the last 50 years!'' she cried. ''The seeds we are sowing, who knows what fruit they will bring?''\par \par \uc2 The packed audience in a former Congregational chapel turned arts center here cheered with the fervor of a religious gathering, reflecting a kind of reverence for the man they had shown up to support: \uc2 Jeremy Corbyn\uc2  , the hard-left leader of Britain's Labour Party. At the party conference in Liverpool just minutes away, he had defeated what his supporters called a ''coup attempt'' by more centrist Labour members of Parliament.\par \par \uc2 Many Labour legislators fear that Mr. Corbyn, 67, is dragging the party so far from the political and ideological mainstream that he will lead it to another devastating political defeat at the hands of the Conservative Party in the next general \uc2 election\uc2 , which is not due until 2020 but is possible earlier.\par \par \uc2 Despite Labour's significant growth in grass-roots members, some fear successive defeats. Janan Ganesh, a Financial Times columnist, wrote that ''there is a reasonable chance, and it becomes stronger by the day, that Gordon Brown will turn out to have been the last Labour prime minister.'' (Mr. Brown left office in 2010.)\par \par \uc2 But if the mood of the Labour conference itself the last few days was resigned in the face of Mr. Corbyn's re-\uc2 election\uc2  on Saturday as party leader, the atmosphere at this parallel conference, held by the hard-left group Ms. Walker helps run, Momentum, verged on ecstasy.\par \par \uc2 In the battle for Labour's direction, Momentum is winning. Seen by critics as a softer successor to the Trotskyist Militant movement, which Labour banned from the party as too extreme in the 1980s, Momentum has flowered into a powerful organizing vehicle for Mr. Corbyn. It has helped him register and mobilize passionate supporters intent on substituting unapologetic socialism for politics as usual.\par \par \uc2 ''People are fed up with a so-called free market system that has produced grotesque inequality, stagnating living standards for the many, calamitous foreign wars without end and a political stitch-up,'' Mr. Corbyn said on Wednesday in remarks to the party conference.\par \par \uc2 In many ways, Momentum's success is the culmination of the backlash on the left to the centrism of Labour under \uc2 Tony Blair\uc2  in the 1990s and the first years of this century. Its detractors view Momentum as na\u239\'00\'EFve at best and dangerous at worst. Its supporters feel they are building a movement less concerned about the next \uc2 election\uc2  cycle than with bringing true socialism to Britain. Either way, the group has solidified Mr. Corbyn's hold on the party's leadership.\par \par \uc2 ''We're heading in the right direction, which is the left direction,'' said Emine Ibrahim, a member of the \uc2 Haringey Council\uc2  in London. Grass-roots membership in the local Labour Party has gone up to 5,500 now from 1,300 before Mr. Corbyn's \uc2 election\uc2  last year, she said, mirroring a tripling of national membership.\par \par \uc2 Daniel Cooper, 26, joined the Labour Party in 2009. Then, he said, ''I realized that it wasn't for me, left and joined the Communist Party, then under \uc2 Jeremy Corbyn\uc2  came back to support Labour.''\par \par \uc2 ''I feel this is the natural time and moment,'' he said, when asked about his support for Momentum. ''The financial crisis is deeper than it was in the 1930s, and we need radical revolutionary ideas to overcome the problems of capitalism.''\par \par \uc2 Momentum has helped Mr. Corbyn take over the party from inside, intimidating and isolating center-left members. Mr. Corbyn and the movement appeal to an electorate that is angry about inequality, globalization and unemployment, and is seeking clearer, simpler choices. While Mr. Corbyn is trying to address them from the left, those same issues are motivating supporters of populist candidates on the right, including Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2  in the United States and \uc2 Marine Le Pen\uc2  of the National Front in France.\par \par \uc2 ''Momentum has remarkable energy,'' said Mark Wickham-Jones, a professor of political science at the University of Bristol. ''But it is clearly energy that is coming from many directions, and it is going to be hard to channel it.''\par \par \uc2 As the Labour Party moves to the left and grows, to become one of the largest in Western Europe, it also seems to slip further from power in a country that has historically disliked extremes.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Wickham-Jones said Labour faced an ''existential crisis,'' having lost its traditional Scottish heartland to the left-leaning Scottish National Party and under challenge from the right in working-class districts by the populist U.K. Independence Party.\par \par \uc2 There is now a clear split between grass-roots party members, he said, and its more pragmatic lawmakers. Of the current 230 Labour members of the House of Commons, 172 voted against Mr. Corbyn in a no-confidence vote in June.\par \par \uc2 In his remarks on Wednesday, Mr. Corbyn seemed to underscore his apparent lack of interest in vote chasing. At a time when limiting immigration is Britain's most prominent political issue -- it was widely seen as the driving force in the nation's vote to leave the \uc2 European Union\uc2  -- Mr. Corbyn pointedly did not promise to impose limits. Instead, he vowed to give extra resources to regions where population increases put pressure on public services and said he would crack down on exploitation of migrant labor to help protect the pay of workers.\par \par \uc2 The British news media largely interpreted these views as na\u239\'00\'EFve, while senior Labour legislators were already weighing methods of curbing immigration to appeal to disenchanted Labour voters who favored leaving the \uc2 European Union\uc2  .\par \par \uc2 This kind of conventional political analysis holds little water among the members of Momentum, who believe that with enough rallies, speeches and street campaigning they can win Britain over to their version of socialism.\par \par \uc2 ''People see in \uc2 Jeremy Corbyn\uc2  the chance to change things, the belief that things can be different,'' said Ian Hodson, the head of the \uc2 Bakers, Food and Allied Workers Union\uc2  .\par \par \uc2 Many of their own party's elected members of Parliament are regarded by newly empowered leftists as closet Conservatives, traitors and worse. ''The M.P.s should be the servants of the party members, not the masters,'' said Matt Wrack, the general secretary of the Fire Brigades Union.\par \par \uc2 The Momentum supporters have a hero in \uc2 John McDonnell\uc2 , the shadow chancellor of the Exchequer and a close Corbyn ally, who persuaded him to fight on against the leadership challenge. Mr. McDonnell grew up poor here in Liverpool and is considered an enforcer, channeling the enthusiasm and passion of the new Labour members and of Momentum.\par \par \uc2 Mr. McDonnell won huge cheers for telling the conference: ''In this party you no longer have to whisper it. It's called socialism.'' He began his remarks to Momentum by lifting his fist and saying, ''Thanks a lot, comrades,'' praising their passion and support for Mr. Corbyn.\par \par \uc2 But for Steven Fielding, a political scientist at \uc2 Nottingham University\uc2  , ''it's difficult to overstate how utterly irrelevant are the speeches and policy debates at this Labour conference.''\par \par \uc2 ''It's political science fiction,'' he said.\par \par \uc2 The novelist Will Self summed up the dilemma of a party caught between old socialist dreams and the revolutionary dreams of the youth of 1968. In the modern digital world ''with its free flows of capital and most critically labor,'' he said, ''there's really no place for a political party with an 1887 heart and a 1968 head.''\par \par \uc2 Follow Steven Erlanger @StevenErlanger and Stephen Castle @_StephenCastle on Twitter.\par \par \uc2 Jeremy Corbyn after being announced as the winner of the Labour Party's leadership contest on Saturday.

\par\par \b \uc2 Election\uc2  2016: \uc2 Clinton\uc2  Aide Gets Attention\b0\par\par\uc2 By Laura Meckler   \par \uc2 747 \uc2 words\par \uc2 29 September 2016\par \uc2 The Wall Street Journal\par \uc2 J\par A6\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 Her emails have been sought by conservative groups, she has been accused by \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  of doing State Department favors for the \uc2 Clinton\uc2  Foundation\uc2 , and she has been embarrassed by her husband's sexual activities.\par \par \uc2 Huma Abedin, \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's longest-serving aide, has received an unusual amount of public attention for a behind-the-scenes staffer. Over the years, Ms. Abedin has graduated from intern to omnipresent personal assistant to vice chairwoman of Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's Democratic presidential campaign and one of her closest advisers.\par \par \uc2 Among Ms. Abedin's most important roles is gatekeeper, a key figure in determining who gets to see Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , and who doesn't. She oversees planning for anything involving the candidate, manages her sprawling network of contacts and talks with Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  more than any other aide.\par \par \uc2 The 41-year-old Ms. Abedin is often on the road, and those who know her say her power derives from her proximity to Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 . She was part of her debate preparation team, and backstage in Hempstead, N.Y., just before Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  walked onto the debate stage on Monday.\par \par \uc2 Her emails with Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  show an intimacy few others can claim. A week after Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  was released from the hospital to treat a blood clot, Ms. Abedin emailed a reminder to take a nap.\par \par \uc2 Ms. Abedin, who declined to comment for this article, is expected to take a senior White House position if Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  defeats Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 A Muslim, Ms. Abedin was born in Kalamazoo, Mich., to Indian- and Pakistani-born parents. She was raised in Saudi Arabia, where her parents went to teach, before returning to the U.S. to attend \uc2 George Washington University\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 During college in 1996, Ms. Abedin went to work as an intern for the first lady, and she has been by Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's side ever since. Thousands of emails exchanged when Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  was secretary of state show she relied on Ms. Abedin.\par \par \uc2 Today, Ms. Abedin vets material that will be released in Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's voice, helps decide who will introduce the candidate and occasionally meets with donors.\par \par \uc2 "She's multifaceted, has a great strategic sense, and she's a wonderful colleague," Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's campaign chairman, \uc2 John Podesta\uc2 , said. "She's an integral part of the team."\par \par \uc2 Ms. Abedin had a personal email address on the \uc2 Clinton\uc2  family server, which has resulted in all of her correspondence being released to conservative groups \uc2 Citizens United\uc2  and \uc2 Judicial Watch\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Several of the messages released so far show \uc2 Clinton\uc2  Foundation\uc2  officials asking her for favors. For example, in April 2009, Doug Band, then a top foundation official, emailed Ms. Abedin to ask for help for a top foundation donor, Lebanese-Nigerian businessman Gilbert Chagoury.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  said of such email releases in August: "It's called pay for play."\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's campaign has said that her decisions as secretary of state were unrelated to requests from the foundation and its supporters.\par \par \uc2 Since 2013, Ms. Abedin has been under investigation by \uc2 Sen. Charles Grassley\uc2  (R., Iowa) for an arrangement under the Special Government Employee program, which allowed her to simultaneously work for the State Department, Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  personally, the foundation and a private consulting firm called Teneo, founded in part by Mr. Band.\par \par \uc2 The program was created to allow agencies to give short-term jobs to people from the private sector with particular expertise, and Mr. Grassley charges that using it for Ms. Abedin was an abuse.\par \par \uc2 The State Department has said Ms. Abedin's work for Teneo was unrelated to her work for the government. It also said her outside employment while at State was arranged so that the government wouldn't be paying Ms. Abedin for work she did charting Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's post-State career.\par \par \uc2 Meantime, Ms. Abedin's personal life has been repeatedly thrust into public view thanks to her husband, former Rep. Anthony Weiner, who resigned from Congress after admitting he had sent salacious photos and messages over the internet to other women.\par \par \uc2 She stuck by Mr. Weiner as he tried to mount a political comeback, and even after it was disclosed he continued sexting other women after he left Congress. The last straw came after the New York Post reported in August that he had done it yet again. She announced she was leaving him.\par \par \uc2 ---\par \par \uc2 Peter Nicholas contributed to this article.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=wjco20160929000095"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document J000000020160929ec9t0002y\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 National Desk; SECTA\par \b \uc2 Obamas Denounce \uc2 Trump\uc2 , Urging Supporters Not to Back Third-Party Candidates\b0\par\par\uc2 By MICHAEL D. SHEAR \par \uc2 994 \uc2 words\par \uc2 29 September 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 18\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 WASHINGTON -- President Obama and the first lady, \uc2 Michelle Obama\uc2 , issued scathing denunciations of \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2  on Wednesday, conveying the same message that a vote for a third-party candidate rather than \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  would help elect a president who is unfit for office.\par \par \uc2 In a radio interview Wednesday morning, Mr. Obama lashed out at the Republican presidential nominee for denigrating women and mocked Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's debate appearance, saying it exposed him as a person who ''appears to only care about himself.''\par \par \uc2 Mr. Obama described Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  as someone who was unqualified to sit in the Oval Office and ''doesn't do his homework, doesn't know basic facts that you'd need to know.''\par \par \uc2 ''You had somebody who basically insulted women and then doubled down,'' Mr. Obama told Steve Harvey, a syndicated radio host. ''In terms of how he talks about them and talks about their weight and talks about how they look instead of the content of their character and their capabilities, which is not something that I want, not somebody I want in the Oval Office.''\par \par \uc2 Hours later, in the first of two appearances on Wednesday for \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , the Democratic nominee for president, the first lady tore into Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  without ever using his name.\par \par \uc2 ''If a candidate is erratic and threatening; if a candidate traffics in prejudice, fears and lies on the campaign trail; if a candidate thinks that not paying taxes makes you smart, or that it's good business when people lose their homes; if a candidate regularly and flippantly makes cruel and insulting comments about women, about how we look, how we act -- well, sadly, that's who that candidate really is,'' Mrs. Obama told an audience of mostly students at \uc2 La Salle University\uc2  in Philadelphia. ''That is the kind of president they will be.''\par \par \uc2 The first lady is one of Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's most popular surrogates, and the White House has said she intends to make appearances across the country in the next 40 days. Mrs. Obama has already put together a feisty, impassioned stump speech that heaps praise on Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  as the obvious choice to succeed her husband, while dismissing Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  as little more than a joke.\par \par \uc2 Speaking in Pittsburgh later in the afternoon, Mrs. Obama prompted laughter when she acknowledged that Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  had seen the presidency ''from every angle -- the staggering stakes, the brutal hours, the overwhelming stresses'' -- and still wanted to do the job.\par \par \uc2 Together, the Obamas are being deployed by the \uc2 Clinton\uc2  campaign to try to whip up enthusiasm among Democrats who have been the president's most loyal and passionate supporters: African-Americans and young people. Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  spoke at two college campuses on Wednesday and Mr. Obama spoke with Mr. Harvey, an African-American host of radio and television programs.\par \par \uc2 In echoes of each other, the president and Mrs. Obama both stressed the need for Democrats to turn out in force for Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  and not to waste their vote by casting ballots for third-party candidates who have little chance of winning.\par \par \uc2 ''You could also help swing an entire precinct for Hillary's opponent with a protest vote or by staying home out of frustration,'' Mrs. Obama said. ''Because here's the truth: Either \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  or her opponent will be elected president this year. And if you vote for someone other than Hillary, or if you don't vote at all, then you are helping to elect Hillary's opponent.''\par \par \uc2 Mr. Obama also implored his supporters to make sure they voted for Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  and insisted repeatedly that anyone who failed to vote in November, or who voted for a third-party candidate, was effectively casting a ballot for Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 ''If you don't vote, that's a vote for \uc2 Trump\uc2 ,'' Mr. Obama said. ''If you vote for a third-party candidate who has got no chance to win, that's a vote for \uc2 Trump\uc2 .''\par \par \uc2 White House officials have always expected that Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's campaign would call on Mr. Obama for help in the final weeks before the \uc2 election\uc2 . But with the contest close in many battleground states, that effort is taking on added urgency.\par \par \uc2 Polls in some of those states have suggested that millennial voters who surged to the polls for Mr. Obama in 2008 and 2012 may not be so inclined to do the same for Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 . In some cases, younger voters, many of whom supported the presidential campaign of Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, have indicated they intend to support a third-party candidate.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Obama urged his supporters not to be complacent.\par \par \uc2 ''The notion somehow that I'm not as inspired because Barack and Michelle are not on the ballot this time, and maybe we kind of take it easy,'' he said. ''My legacy is on the ballot. All the work we've done over the last eight years is on the ballot.''\par \par \uc2 Mr. Obama praised Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , calling her ''as qualified as anybody who's ever run for this office'' and expressing frustration that people have not given her the credit she deserves for her accomplishments.\par \par \uc2 ''Part of it may be because she is a woman, and we have not elected a woman president before,'' he said.\par \par \uc2 But he spent more time criticizing Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Mr. Obama accused him of ''rooting for the housing market to collapse because he would be in a position to buy up all of these properties.'' He said he did not want a president whose ''only focus is how can I make a buck off it.''\par \par \uc2 Follow The \uc2 New York Times\uc2 's politics and Washington coverage on \uc2 Facebook\uc2  and \uc2 Twitter\uc2 , and sign up for the First Draft politics newsletter.\par \par \uc2 President Obama on Wednesday during a CNN town hall-style meeting in Fort Lee, Va.

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 On Tuesday, \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2  boasted of what he described as widespread approval of his performance in the first presidential debate with \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Such a great honor. Final debate polls are in - and the MOVEMENT wins!#AmericaFirst #MAGA #ImWithYou{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://t.co/3KWOl2ibaW"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 https://t.co/3KWOl2ibaW}}}\uc2  pic.twitter.com/sfCEE3I5pF -- \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2  (@realDonaldTrump) September 27, 2016\par \par \uc2 Those ''final debate polls'' consisted of readers on news sites who were asked their opinion of who had won.\par \par \uc2 While it looked good for Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , pollsters and some journalists offered a protest: Informal, unscientific ''polls'' on news sites produce junk data that does not indicate how the public actually feels, and should not be believed as an indication of -- well, much of anything.\par \par \uc2 ''Those do a good job of engaging audiences online, and they do a good job of letting you know how other people who have come to the webpage feel about whatever issue,'' said \uc2 Mollyann Brodie\uc2 , the executive director for public opinion and survey research at the \uc2 Kaiser Family Foundation\uc2 . ''But they're not necessarily good at telling you, in general, what people think, because we don't know who's come to that website and who's taken it.''\par \par \uc2 Professional pollsters use scientific statistical methods to make sure that their small random samples are demographically appropriate to indicate how larger groups of people think. Online polls do nothing of the sort, and are not random, allowing anyone who finds the poll to vote. They are thus open to manipulation from those who would want to stuff the ballot box. Users on \uc2 Reddit\uc2  and 4chan directed masses of people to vote for Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  in the instant-analysis surveys, according to The Daily Dot. Similar efforts were observed on \uc2 Twitter\uc2  and other sites.\par \par \uc2 Even when there is no intentional manipulation, the results are largely a reflection of who is likely to come to a particular site and who would be motivated enough to participate. Intuitively, it's no surprise that readers of sites like Breitbart News and the Drudge Report would see Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  as the winner, just as Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  would be more likely to find support on liberal sites.\par \par \uc2 It's not just in politics; take the question of identifying the best undefeated team in the N.F.L. after three weeks. The \uc2 New England Patriots\uc2  and the \uc2 Denver Broncos\uc2  are likely the most obvious candidates for football fans, but when a news site in Philadelphia asked the question on Sunday after a big win by the Eagles? You can guess what happened.\par \par \uc2 Safe to say, the city of Philadelphia is excited about their Eagles. #EaglesTalk pic.twitter.com/kOt0TNi7oI -- CSN Philly (@CSNPhilly) September 26, 2016\par \par \uc2 Similar factors are at play on every website. \uc2 Frank Newport\uc2 , the editor in chief of Gallup, said most reader response surveys on news sites are done more to benefit the news organization than to educate the public.\par \par \uc2 ''In our business, the key is generalizability,'' he said, referring to the ability of a sample group to apply to a wider population. ''That's the core of what we do. Typically, it takes a lot of time, and a lot of effort, and a lot of money to do it.''\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 New York Times\uc2  conducts scientific polling and generally avoids unscientific reader polls on its website. The \uc2 New York Times Magazine\uc2  asks a selection of its readers offbeat questions, but each edition discloses the unscientific methodology.\par \par \uc2 Are polls like this an accurate measure of how the electorate responded to Monday's debate? -- Huffington Post (@HuffingtonPost) September 27, 2016\par \par \uc2 Confusing matters is the rise of online polls that try to use scientific methodology. Those are also causing concern in the profession.\par \par \uc2 Andrew Seaman, the ethics committee chairman for the Society of Professional Journalists, said the common use of online opt-in polls warranted a review in newsrooms. In a hypothetical situation, he imagined a news site that crowned the best pizza shop based on 13 responses in a city of 10,000 people. It might seem benign, but other pizza shop owners could lose business -- and the stakes would be higher in more significant cases, like an \uc2 election\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 ''My advice would be to avoid opt-in polls that provide little value to the public,'' Mr. Seaman said in an email. ''Otherwise, the news organizations run the risk of being irresponsible and possibly harmful.''\par \par \uc2 Does the public understand what makes a poll educational and what makes one just for fun?\par \par \uc2 ''I would need a scientific poll to tell you that,'' Mr. Newport said.\par \par \uc2 Find out what you need to know about the 2016 presidential race today, and get politics news updates via \uc2 Facebook\uc2 , \uc2 Twitter\uc2  and the First Draft newsletter.\par \par \uc2 Document NYTF000020160929ec9t0007a\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 National Desk; SECTA\par \b \uc2 Aides' Plan: Drill \uc2 Trump\uc2  for Round 2\b0\par\par\uc2 By PATRICK HEALY, ASHLEY PARKER and MAGGIE HABERMAN; Nick Corasaniti contributed reporting. \par \uc2 1,793 \uc2 words\par \uc2 29 September 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 1\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Campaign advisers to \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , concerned that his focus and objectives had dissolved during the first presidential debate on Monday, plan to more rigorously prepare him for his next face-off with \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 . They intend to drill the Republican nominee on crucial answers, facts and counterattacks, and coach him on ways to whack Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  on issues even if he is not asked about them.\par \par \uc2 Whether he is open to practicing meticulously is a major concern, however, according to some of these advisers and others close to Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 While analysts from both parties and several focus groups declared Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  the winner of the debate, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  tried to claim that title for himself, citing unscientific online surveys, and told his advisers that he believed he had done well in the first half-hour of the 90-minute event.\par \par \uc2 A delicate approach to the candidate is now in the works. Before his advisers can shape Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's performance for the next debate, on Oct. 9 in St. Louis, they need to convince him that he can do better than he did in the first one and that only a disciplined, strategic attack can damage Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  with voters. Advisers said that Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  had been prepped to handle Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's attacks but did not effectively execute responses to them.\par \par \uc2 Republican allies of Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  said he needed to exploit what they see as her vulnerabilities.\par \par \uc2 ''People know who Hillary is -- they've seen her and heard about her for 30 years,'' said \uc2 Sean Spicer\uc2 , chief strategist for the \uc2 Republican National Committee\uc2 , who works for the \uc2 Trump\uc2  campaign part time. ''And what needs to be done next is that he is seen as the element of change.''\par \par \uc2 At a rally on Wednesday in Council Bluffs, Iowa, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  bragged that he had won the debate by ''a landslide.'' He said he did not think Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  ''did well in the debate at all,'' and noted the feedback that he received from people as he took the stage for the rally.\par \par \uc2 ''I just walked in, and I saw so many great people, and they said, 'Wow, you did so great in the debate,''' he said. ''And we understand that. We understand that.''\par \par \uc2 Even as Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's advisers publicly backed him and praised his debate performance, they were privately awash in second-guessing about why he stopped attacking Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  on trade and character issues and instead grew erratic, impatient and subdued as the night went on. In interviews, seven campaign aides and advisers, most of whom sought anonymity to speak candidly, expressed frustration and discouragement over their candidate's performance Monday night.\par \par \uc2 They blamed his overstuffed schedule, including a last-minute rally in Virginia that was added days before the debate. They blamed the large number of voluble people on his prep team, including two retired military figures with no political background. And they blamed the lack of time spent on preparing a game plan in the first place.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , for his part, sought to blame everything but himself. During an appearance on Fox News on Tuesday, he charged that the moderator, Lester Holt of NBC News, had become overly aggressive with him -- although he inaccurately said that Mr. Holt had questioned him over a 1973 federal discrimination lawsuit against Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's company. (Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  had raised the lawsuit question.) He also suggested that his performance was related to a faulty mike -- even though he was perfectly audible during the telecast -- and that he may have been the victim of sabotage.\par \par \uc2 And at a rally in Florida later that evening, he ripped Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  in scathing terms that he declined to use when they were face to face.\par \par \uc2 But Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's lack of facility as a one-on-one debater was glaring at times, such as his inability to challenge Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's judgment over the attacks on the American diplomatic mission in Benghazi, Libya. He protested on Fox News that he could not find a way to bring up Benghazi, saying, ''Don't forget, you are asked a question as to progress or as to something, and it's hard to get off to Benghazi sometimes the way the questions were framed.''\par \par \uc2 Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , who prepared at length for the debate, was far more deft at unnerving her opponent, finding a way during an exchange about trade to bring up a loan that Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  had received from his father. Topics during general \uc2 election\uc2  debates are often inserted at prime openings by the candidates themselves, rather than by the moderators, whom Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  relied on during the primary debates to set the tone.\par \par \uc2 The shape and schedule for Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's next round of debate preparations are still under discussion, his advisers said.\par \par \uc2 Some of the advisers want to practice getting under his skin, as Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  did, to gauge his response, but they offered no details about doing so. Others wanted practice sessions built around the next debate's format, a town hall-style meeting, where Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  is likely to engage with undecided voters asking him questions and, at times, move from his chair to walk the stage. Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  has little experience with the format, which can be challenging for people who do not practice managing their body language and movements.\par \par \uc2 Several advisers also want to impress upon him the need to stick to a strategy and a plan of battle against a female candidate -- the kind of opponent he has less experience facing -- rather than spend time polishing a string of disparate zingers that Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , a skilled debater, was able to easily parry Monday night.\par \par \uc2 Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  succeeded several times in baiting Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , making him become defensive, lose his cool or dig himself into a political hole, particularly late in the debate as he struggled to defend himself against charges that he had made sexist and racist remarks. He also repeatedly interrupted or talked over Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , which some female voters found alienating. Some allies of Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  say he is not preparing enough to do battle with a woman in mind; he has only one senior adviser who is a woman, his campaign manager, Kellyanne Conway.\par \par \uc2 Almost all of his advisers rejected the idea that the debate was a failure for Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , noting that he landed some punches and insisting that Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  looked more polished than she was because of her opposition.\par \par \uc2 But all of them described the debate as filled with missed opportunities. And they openly expressed frustration that Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  seemed unable to stop chasing chum that Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  tossed at him.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's debate preparation was unconventional. Aides have introduced a lectern and encouraged him to participate in mock debates, but he has not embraced them, focusing mostly on conversations and discussions with advisers.\par \par \uc2 During the primaries, the group briefing him for debates was small and closely held. By the weekend before the debate on Monday at \uc2 Hofstra University\uc2 , there were nearly a dozen people preparing Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , including the retired Army generals Michael Flynn and Keith Kellogg, neither of whom has experience in presidential debates.\par \par \uc2 There were early efforts to run a more standard form of general \uc2 election\uc2  debate-prep camp, led by Roger Ailes, the ousted Fox News chief, at Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's golf course in Bedminster, N.J. But Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  found it hard to focus during those meetings, according to multiple people briefed on the process who requested anonymity to discuss internal deliberations. That left Mr. Ailes, who at the time was deeply distracted by his removal from Fox and the news media reports surrounding it, discussing his own problems as well as recounting political war stories, according to two people present for the sessions.\par \par \uc2 Rudolph W. Giuliani\uc2 , a former New York City mayor and a friend of Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's who has been traveling with him extensively, took over much of the preparation efforts by the end. But with Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  receiving so much conflicting advice in those sessions, he absorbed little of it.\par \par \uc2 The team had primed Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  to look for roughly a dozen key phrases and expressions Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  uses when she is uncertain or uncomfortable, but he did not seem to pay attention during the practice sessions, one aide said, and failed to home in on her vulnerabilities during the debate.\par \par \uc2 ''It clearly looked like he ran out of gas after 30 minutes, and that came through loud and clear,'' said Scott Reed, the senior political strategist for the \uc2 U.S. Chamber of Commerce\uc2 , who has not supported Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 ''\uc2 Trump\uc2  needs to show a higher level seriousness, so that he's better positioned as an agent of change,'' Mr. Reed added. ''If he can accomplish that, he'll win undecided voters and late-breaking voters who clearly don't want to support \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 .''\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's best lines, several aides said, came when he talked about how Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  had been in politics for 30 years and had yet to offer any solutions, and when he parried a question from her about releasing his tax returns by saying he would release them when she released the 33,000 deleted emails from her time as secretary of state. But he quickly dropped the emails line.\par \par \uc2 The aides were particularly frustrated when Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , unprompted, mentioned the comedian \uc2 Rosie O'Donnell\uc2  during an exchange about his treatment of women, saying she deserved his vitriol and criticism.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's campaign tried to soothe supporters on a conference call on Tuesday by pointing to instant polls that showed him winning the debate, even though a vast majority of surveys showed that Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  led. And his backers painted an optimistic picture of a campaign on course.\par \par \uc2 ''I think he was extremely effective in speaking to the targeted audience of swing state voters and undecided voters,'' said \uc2 John Jay LaValle\uc2 , the chairman of the Republican Party in Suffolk County, N.Y., and a supporter of Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Find out what you need to know about the 2016 presidential race today, and get politics news updates via \uc2 Facebook\uc2 , \uc2 Twitter\uc2  and the First Draft newsletter.\par \par \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2  at an event on Wednesday in Chicago.

\par\par \uc2 Foreign Desk; SECTA\par \b \uc2 Fast Friends Who Found Peace Out of Reach\b0\par\par\uc2 By PETER BAKER; Isabel Kershner contributed reporting from Jerusalem, and Majd Al Waheidi from Gaza. \par \uc2 1,262 \uc2 words\par \uc2 29 September 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 10\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 JERUSALEM -- They were an international odd couple with seemingly little in common, a 40-something African-American born in Hawaii and an octogenarian Zionist born in a shtetl in Poland. But somehow Barack Obama and Shimon Peres hit it off.\par \par \uc2 When they met, Mr. Obama was still a junior senator on the rise, and Mr. Peres was in the twilight years of a storied career that spanned the lifetime of his nation. Mr. Obama asked for advice. Mr. Peres urged him to disregard the notion that the future was for the young. ''Leave the future to me,'' Mr. Peres said. ''I have time.''\par \par \uc2 Mr. Peres's time ran out on Wednesday as he died at 93, two weeks after a stroke. Mr. Obama finds his own time running short, at least his time in the world's most powerful office, and he is contemplating a second act, always a specialty of Mr. Peres's. In the end, they had more in common than might have been imagined, two Nobel Peace laureates who found peace maddeningly out of reach.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Obama's response to Mr. Peres's death on Wednesday was striking. He issued a statement that was unusually long and personal, and he called Mr. Peres's children with condolences even before they had announced their father's death to the world. Mr. Obama made plans to attend the funeral on Friday, only the second time in nearly eight years in office he has traveled overseas to say farewell to a foreign leader. (The other was Nelson Mandela.)\par \par \uc2 ''I will always be grateful that I was able to call Shimon my friend,'' Mr. Obama said in the statement. ''Shimon,'' he added, ''was the essence of Israel itself.''\par \par \uc2 The American president was hardly the only world leader on Wednesday to pile on praise. Presidents, prime ministers and the pope all hailed Mr. Peres as a champion of peace.\par \par \uc2 Many of them will also attend the funeral at Mount Herzl, the Israeli national cemetery, including heads of state or government from France, Canada and Germany. Joining Mr. Obama will be former President \uc2 Bill \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , who hosted Mr. Peres, Yitzhak Rabin and Yasir Arafat in 1993 on the White House lawn for the signing of the Oslo peace accords.\par \par \uc2 But admired as he was at home and abroad, Mr. Peres was seen as a more complicated figure among Palestinians, who remembered his role in advancing settlements in the West Bank and in ordering a brief but intense military campaign against Hezbollah in Lebanon in 1996 that led to civilian deaths.\par \par \uc2 Mahmoud Abbas, the president of the Palestinian Authority, which emerged from the Oslo agreement, sent a letter of condolence to the Peres family, calling him a ''brave'' partner in peace who had labored intensively until his death to realize the promise of the accords, according to the Palestinian news media.\par \par \uc2 But leaders of \uc2 Hamas\uc2 , the militant Palestinian group that controls Gaza and is considered a terrorist organization by Israel, the United States and other nations, alternately celebrated Mr. Peres's death or complained that it had allowed him to escape justice.\par \par \uc2 ''He is a criminal who committed massacres against the Palestinian people and justified wars in Gaza,'' Hazem Qasem, a spokesman for Hamas, said by telephone. ''He is one of the founding leaders of the Israeli occupation that caused the displacement of millions of Palestinians.''\par \par \uc2 In a way, though, Mr. Peres was the Israeli leader Mr. Obama wished he had had as a partner. Never enamored of Prime Minister \uc2 Benjamin Netanyahu\uc2 , Mr. Obama clearly would have had a better connection with Mr. Peres.\par \par \uc2 ''Peres was the last Israeli political leader who wholeheartedly believed in and advocated for a negotiated two-state solution between Israelis and Palestinians,'' said Tamara Cofman Wittes, a former deputy assistant secretary of state for the Middle East under Mr. Obama.\par \par \uc2 Even now, Mr. Obama is considering laying down his proposed parameters for peace after the November \uc2 election\uc2 , despite Mr. Netanyahu's objections. For Mr. Obama, Mr. Peres's death is an opportunity to prod Israel to fulfill its former leader's legacy.\par \par \uc2 ''I can think of no greater tribute to his life than to renew our commitment to the peace that we know is possible,'' Mr. Obama said.\par \par \uc2 Some Israeli analysts said they expected Mr. Obama to use the occasion to make a new pitch for a peace settlement, but they doubted that Mr. Peres's death would change the political dynamics.\par \par \uc2 ''Just by appearing here, he'll probably want to make a speech that will mention the two-state solution,'' said Zalman Shoval, a two-time Israeli ambassador to the United States and a member of Mr. Netanyahu's Likud Party. ''On whom will this have an impact is another question. On the Israeli public? I don't think so. On the Palestinians? They have their own problems.''\par \par \uc2 Mr. Obama does not harbor any illusions about making great progress in the few months he has left in office. ''Obama doesn't believe that peace is possible with the current leadership in Israel and \uc2 the Palestinian Authority\uc2 ,'' said Martin S. Indyk, his former Middle East special envoy. Instead, the idea would be to lay down a marker for the future Mr. Peres talked about.\par \par \uc2 When Mr. Obama first met Mr. Peres, they traded notes on how dysfunctional each of their political systems really was.\par \par \uc2 ''They took an immediate liking to each other,'' said Einat Wilf, then an adviser to Mr. Peres, who was at the meeting, ''and had a sense that they both shared the same fundamental attitude of optimism, the belief in the ability of humans to shape their future through their own actions, and that the arc of history bends toward progress and justice.''\par \par \uc2 After Mr. Obama's inauguration in 2009, Mr. Peres made a point of visiting him at the White House before Mr. Netanyahu did. Three years later, Mr. Obama awarded Mr. Peres the Presidential Medal of Freedom and hosted a gala East Room dinner for him. A year later, Mr. Obama visited Israel and spent time with Mr. Peres again.\par \par \uc2 ''He had a special relationship with Obama, no question about it,'' said Yehuda Ben Meir, a former Israeli deputy foreign minister now at the Institute for National Security Studies in Tel Aviv. ''Although they were totally different in background and personality, evidently there was some mutual admiration of each other and an understanding that each one was a special person.''\par \par \uc2 Indeed, Mr. Peres was protective of Mr. Obama, who has been criticized fiercely in Israel for his handling of the Palestinian conflict and for his accord with Iran intended to curb its nuclear program. When Mr. Ben Meir wrote an article defending Mr. Obama, he said, Mr. Peres called at 7 a.m. to congratulate him on it.\par \par \uc2 The regard went both ways. ''A light has gone out, but the hope he gave us will burn forever,'' Mr. Obama said. ''Shimon Peres was a soldier for Israel, for the Jewish people, for justice, for peace and for the belief that we can be true to our best selves -- to the very end of our time on earth, and in the legacy that we leave to others.''\par \par \uc2 President Obama with Shimon Peres at a state dinner in Jerusalem in March 2013 after Mr. Peres bestowed on him Israel's Presidential Medal of Distinction.

\par\par \uc2 Foreign Desk; SECT\par \b \uc2 Obama and \uc2 Bill \uc2 Clinton\uc2  to Travel to Israel to Honor Shimon Peres\b0\par\par\uc2 By PETER BAKER and ISABEL KERSHNER; Majd Al Waheidi contributed reporting from Gaza, and Alison Smale from Berlin. \par \uc2 1,076 \uc2 words\par \uc2 29 September 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 The New York Times on the Web\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 JERUSALEM -- World leaders made plans to converge on Israel to pay tribute to Shimon Peres, the Nobel Prize-winning former prime minister who died on Wednesday, focusing renewed attention on his quest for peace in a fractured land that fell well short of his dreams.\par \par \uc2 Presidents, prime ministers and a prince accepted invitations to the funeral on Friday for Mr. Peres, who transformed himself from a polarizing figure to perhaps Israel's most renowned elder statesman.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Peres, 93, who slipped away just over two weeks after what his doctor called ''a massive stroke,'' emerged as a symbol of what might have been, after the peace accords he helped broker in the 1990s failed to bring lasting change.\par \par \uc2 The United States will send a delegation including President Obama, former President \uc2 Bill \uc2 Clinton\uc2  and Secretary of State \uc2 John Kerry\uc2 , the \uc2 Israeli Foreign Ministry\uc2  said.\par \par \uc2 But the ministry mistakenly reported that \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , the Democratic nominee for president and a former secretary of state, would attend. With just weeks until the \uc2 election\uc2 , Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's campaign said she would not attend.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Obama, who has been at odds with the current Israeli prime minister, \uc2 Benjamin Netanyahu\uc2 , over the logjammed peace process, made clear that he saw the moment as an opportunity to prod Israel to fulfill Mr. Peres's legacy.\par \par \uc2 ''I can think of no greater tribute to his life than to renew our commitment to the peace that we know is possible,'' Mr. Obama said in a statement.\par \par \uc2 Some Israeli analysts said they expected Mr. Obama to use the occasion to make a new pitch for a peace settlement that would grant statehood to the Palestinians, but they doubted that Mr. Peres's death would change the dynamic.\par \par \uc2 ''Just by appearing here, he'll probably want to make a speech that will mention the two-state solution,'' said Zalman Shoval, a two-time Israeli ambassador to the United States and a member of Mr. Netanyahu's Likud party. ''On whom will this have an impact is another question. On the Israeli public? I don't think so. On the Palestinians? They have their own problems.''\par \par \uc2 Mr. Peres's body will lie in state on Thursday at the Knesset, the Israeli Parliament, and a funeral will be held the next day at Mount Herzl, the national cemetery.\par \par \uc2 Israeli government ministers stood for a moment of silence at a special cabinet meeting on Wednesday. A portrait of Mr. Peres, with a black band across one corner, was in the background.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Netanyahu, a former political opponent of Mr. Peres who unseated him as prime minister in 1996, opened the meeting with the words, ''This is the first day of the state of Israel without Shimon Peres.''\par \par \uc2 He added: ''I admired him. I loved him.''\par \par \uc2 But Mr. Peres was seen as a more complicated figure among Palestinians, who remembered his role in advancing settlements in the West Bank and ordering a brief but intense military campaign against Hezbollah in Lebanon in 1996 that led to civilian deaths.\par \par \uc2 ''Peres was an unrepentant war criminal and should be memorialized as such,'' said Diana Buttu, a former adviser to the Palestinian leadership in the West Bank.\par \par \uc2 Mahmoud Abbas, the president of the Palestinian Authority, which controls the West Bank, sent a letter of condolence to the Peres family, saying Mr. Peres had been a ''brave'' partner in peace and had invested intensively in trying to realize the promise of the Oslo Accords of 1993 until his final moments.\par \par \uc2 But leaders of \uc2 Hamas\uc2 , the more militant Palestinian group that controls Gaza and is considered a terrorist organization by Israel, the United States and other nations, alternately celebrated Mr. Peres's death or complained that it allowed him to escape justice.\par \par \uc2 ''He is a criminal who committed massacres against the Palestinian people and justified wars in Gaza,'' Hazem Qasem, a spokesman for Hamas, said by telephone. ''He is one of the founding leaders of the Israeli occupation that caused the displacement of millions of Palestinians.''\par \par \uc2 While Mr. Peres was a divisive figure for much of his long career, he came to enjoy support and admiration across the Israeli political spectrum by his final years.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Netanyahu visited Mr. Peres in the hospital during the last two weeks, as did the opposition leader Isaac Herzog. Mr. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  called the hospital for updates. \uc2 Pope Francis\uc2  prayed for his recovery.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Obama, who awarded Mr. Peres the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2012, called the former prime minister's family after his death to convey his sympathies.\par \par \uc2 In an unusually long and personal statement, Mr. Obama described their first meeting, while he was a United States senator, and he described their conversations in detail. ''Shimon was the essence of Israel itself,'' he said.\par \par \uc2 ''A light has gone out, but the hope he gave us will burn forever,'' he added. ''Shimon Peres was a soldier for Israel, for the Jewish people, for justice, for peace and for the belief that we can be true to our best selves -- to the very end of our time on earth and in the legacy that we leave to others.''\par \par \uc2 Tony Blair\uc2 , the former British prime minister who has worked for years on Middle East peace issues, described Mr. Peres as ''someone I loved deeply'' and as a mentor. ''His intellect, his way with words that was eloquent beyond description, his command of the world and how it was changing were extraordinary,'' he said.\par \par \uc2 In Germany, Foreign Minister \uc2 Frank-Walter Steinmeier\uc2  recalled that Mr. Peres became in 1986 the first Israeli prime minister to visit Berlin, then divided, and that he had described the Israeli-German partnership in evocative and emotional terms in a speech to the German Parliament in 2010.\par \par \uc2 Germany, Mr. Steinmeier added, ''mourns a courageous and wise voice, who was a constant motivation'' to do more.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Peres was surrounded by his children when he died. ''My father used to say, and I quote, 'You are only as great as the cause you serve,' '' Chemi Peres, his son, told reporters afterward. ''He had no interest other than serving the people of Israel in whom he had great faith and whom he loved dearly until his final breath.''\par \par \uc2 Follow Peter Baker @peterbakernyt and Isabel Kersher @IKershner on Twitter.\par \par \uc2 Document NYTF000020160929ec9t00060\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

PETERS and YAMICHE ALCINDOR; Megan Thee-Brenan contributed reporting. \par \uc2 1,576 \uc2 words\par \uc2 29 September 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 1\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 With just six weeks to go until \uc2 Election\uc2  Day, younger voters are shunning the two major political parties on a scale not seen since \uc2 Ross Perot\uc2 's third-party bid for the presidency in 1992, a striking swing in public opinion that is slicing into \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's thin margin for error.\par \par \uc2 Though young people are notoriously fickle about showing up at the polls, they are a growing and potentially pivotal bloc of voters. Millennials now outnumber baby boomers as the country's largest generation. And while they may be more predisposed than other groups to vote Democratic, they are not moving toward the party and its nominee as quickly and predictably as they have in past elections.\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 Clinton\uc2  campaign held several events on Wednesday aimed at millennials, underscoring the urgency with which she and her team are working to lock down the group: about 75 million Americans. Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  traveled to New Hampshire with her former primary rival, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, for a rally with college students.\par \par \uc2 The first lady, \uc2 Michelle Obama\uc2 , spent the day visiting campuses in Philadelphia and Pittsburgh. She had blunt words for anyone thinking about voting for a third party. ''If you vote for someone other than Hillary, or if you don't vote at all,'' she said, ''then you are helping to elect Hillary's opponent.''\par \par \uc2 Though Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  is riding high after a strong debate performance on Monday, during which she explicitly mentioned issues, like climate change, that appeal to the young, she has a lot of ground to make up.\par \par \uc2 Several factors are complicating the immense task of registering and turning out millennials, the 18- to 34-year-olds who are already hard to reach because their media consumption habits do not lend themselves to traditional television-focused campaigns.\par \par \uc2 They tend not to be motivated by any single, unifying issue, making the job of messaging harder. They are declaring themselves unaffiliated with either party at a rate faster than any other generation. They say the political process and the two-party system are unresponsive to their concerns.\par \par \uc2 And, in what is one of the most difficult barriers for Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  to break through, young people often display little understanding of how a protest vote for a third-party candidate, or not voting at all, can alter the outcome of a close \uc2 election\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 The vast majority of millennials were not old enough to vote in 2000, when Ralph Nader ran as the Green Party nominee and, with the strong backing of young voters, helped cost Vice President Al Gore the presidency.\par \par \uc2 ''Ralph who?'' said David Frasier, a junior at Charleston Southern University.\par \par \uc2 ''Didn't he kind of come in at the last minute and kind of alter the votes or something?'' Mr. Frasier, 26, asked, his memory barely jogged. ''I was too young to remember.''\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 Clinton\uc2  campaign's biggest problem with young voters could be summed up by Mr. Frasier. He is liberal-minded and voted for Mr. Sanders in the South Carolina primary. But he is not likely to vote for either Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  or \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , the Republican nominee, both of whom he called ''pawns and puppets.''\par \par \uc2 Echoing sentiments that seem to be driving many young people away from politics, Mr. Frasier said he felt powerless to bring about change through voting. ''I don't feel like we have control,'' he said. ''I kind of feel like this whole \uc2 election\uc2  is just playing the American people.''\par \par \uc2 Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's weakness with young voters is largely because of the support third-party candidates are drawing away. Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's support among the young has hovered around 25 percent in recent polls.\par \par \uc2 More than a third of voters 18 to 29 said in the latest New York Times/CBS News poll that they would vote for either Gary Johnson, the Libertarian candidate, or Jill Stein, the Green Party candidate: Mr. Johnson had the support of 26 percent of those voters, and Ms. Stein had 10 percent.\par \par \uc2 Given the choice of just Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  and Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , 10 percent said they would not vote at all -- double that of any other age group. An ABC News/Washington Post poll this month found a similar level of support for third-party candidates: 20 percent for Mr. Johnson and 6 percent for Ms. Stein among registered voters ages 18 to 39.\par \par \uc2 The stubborn popularity of the third-party candidates has become a concern to Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  and her allies. So far, the support for them has not softened, as it often does in the fall.\par \par \uc2 ''Historically, that's what has happened,'' said Jefrey Pollock, who is advising the ''super PAC'' working on Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's behalf, Priorities USA. ''But history isn't repeating itself right now, which is one common theme of this \uc2 election\uc2  cycle.''\par \par \uc2 Some of Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's advisers believe that the absence of Mr. Johnson and Ms. Stein from the debate stage on Monday -- both failed to meet the 15 percent polling threshold to qualify -- will help bring down their numbers. In the meantime, the \uc2 Clinton\uc2  campaign has accelerated its aggressive courting of young voters.\par \par \uc2 That effort involves enlisting Mr. Sanders and Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, two figures popular with young people, to make the case that Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  cannot make for herself.\par \par \uc2 ''I suspect that I know about as much about third-party politics as anybody in Congress,'' Mr. Sanders, an independent himself until he decided to run for president as a Democrat last year, said in an interview. ''And I want anybody who's thinking about voting against \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , and casting a protest vote because she is not all they would like her to be, to understand what the consequences for the country and the world will be.''\par \par \uc2 As interviews with young voters show, it is a hard sell.\par \par \uc2 Nick Chanko, 20, is a student at \uc2 McGill University in Montreal\uc2  who plans to vote in his home state, New York. A registered Democrat, he said he would either vote for Ms. Stein or not vote at all.\par \par \uc2 ''I feel like a lot of the stuff Hillary does, you can see when she is trying to, like, earn the youth vote, and it just doesn't work,'' Mr. Chanko said. ''It's just kind of cringeworthy. She just doesn't seem genuine.''\par \par \uc2 Mr. Chanko said he did remember Mr. Nader's candidacy but thought it was unfair to blame protest votes for spoiling an \uc2 election\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 The debate over the merits of casting a third-party ballot can seem endlessly circular.\par \par \uc2 ''I understand the frustration, but channel that frustration into making government work, not into throwing away your vote,'' Ms. Warren said in an interview. ''They should not trust the system,'' she added. ''But the answer is to seize the system and make it work for the people, not to just turn it over to the bigots and billionaires.''\par \par \uc2 The possibility of young voters' staying away from voting booths in droves come November is very real. Turnout rates among Americans ages 18 to 24 dropped significantly in 2012, to 41 percent from 49 percent in 2008.\par \par \uc2 This is both a frustration and a paradox to people who try to get them to the polls.\par \par \uc2 This huge pool of potential voters has been the animating force behind the largest new social movements on the left, from Occupy Wall Street to Black Lives Matter. Yet many do not equate voting with social change.\par \par \uc2 ''They've shown they have the civic muscle to get things done,'' said \uc2 Allegra Chapman\uc2 , the director of voting and elections at \uc2 Common Cause\uc2 , a nonpartisan civic engagement group. ''The question becomes, how do we translate this civic muscle into the kind that shows up and has a presence at the ballot box?''\par \par \uc2 Repairing the mistrust millennials have of institutions and the political system is not easy.\par \par \uc2 Nathan Mowery, a 26-year-old federal contractor who lives in Gainesville, Va., said that as a Muslim, he would find it hard to vote for Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 . But he said that he found Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  uninspiring and that he planned to vote instead for a third-party candidate. He was unapologetic about his choice.\par \par \uc2 ''I'm casting a protest vote because it makes it visible to major parties that there are people who are motivated to vote but are unwilling to vote for either of them,'' he said. ''I hope that whoever runs in 2020 will get their act together and one of the parties will put somebody up that younger voters can align themselves with.''\par \par \uc2 Asked if he remembered Mr. Nader, Mr. Mowery captured the essence of the \uc2 Clinton\uc2  campaign's fears about young voters.\par \par \uc2 He said he was vaguely familiar with Mr. Nader as another third-party candidate. ''Other than that,'' he said, ''I don't know much.''\par \par \uc2 Find out what you need to know about the 2016 presidential race today, and get politics news updates via \uc2 Facebook\uc2 , \uc2 Twitter\uc2  and the First Draft newsletter.\par \par \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  and Senator Bernie Sanders on Wednesday at the University of New Hampshire.

\par\par \uc2 National Desk; SECTA\par \b \uc2 For Some Newspapers, Endorsing \uc2 Clinton\uc2  Means Losing Subscribers\b0\par\par\uc2 By SYDNEY EMBER \par \uc2 698 \uc2 words\par \uc2 29 September 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 17\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 The subscription cancellations were coming every 10 minutes. Angry readers have been calling in droves. One caller issued a death threat.\par \par \uc2 ''We're feeling the weight of our history,'' Phil Boas, the editorial page editor of The Arizona Republic, said in a telephone interview on Wednesday. Until it endorsed \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  on Tuesday, the newspaper, founded in 1890, had never endorsed a Democrat over a Republican for president.\par \par \uc2 In endorsing Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , The Republic's editorial was, by any interpretation, scathing toward her opponent, \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2 . ''\uc2 Trump\uc2  responds to criticism with the petulance of verbal spit wads,'' the editorial says at one point. ''That's beneath our national dignity.''\par \par \uc2 ''\uc2 Trump\uc2 's long history of objectifying women and his demeaning comments about women during the campaign are not just good-old-boy gaffes,'' the editorial added. ''They are evidence of deep character flaws. They are part of a pattern.''\par \par \uc2 The newspaper is not the first this year to break with its long tradition of endorsing Republicans for president. The Dallas Morning News, which had not supported a Democrat for president since before World War II, and The Cincinnati Enquirer, which has endorsed Republicans for nearly 100 years, have backed Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 . The Houston Chronicle, which has in the past endorsed a Democrat for president but which typically supports Republicans, eschewed Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  in July, long before endorsements are generally published in an \uc2 election\uc2  year.\par \par \uc2 The papers lay out different reasons for supporting Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  over Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  -- his lack of political experience versus her established political career, his outbursts and insults versus her steadiness -- and some are perhaps more repudiations of Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  than glowing endorsements of Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , whose faults are also cited.\par \par \uc2 ''Any one of \uc2 Trump\uc2 's less than sterling qualities -- his erratic temperament, his dodgy business practices, his racism, his Putin-like strongman inclinations and faux-populist demagoguery, his contempt for the rule of law, his ignorance -- is enough to be disqualifying,'' the editorial board of The Houston Chronicle wrote.\par \par \uc2 The Cincinnati Enquirer, which endorsed Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  last week, put it particularly bluntly: ''\uc2 Trump\uc2  is a clear and present danger to our country.''\par \par \uc2 For some readers, however, the endorsements proved a step too far. ''Certainly, we've paid a price for our presidential recommendation,'' Mike Wilson, the editor of The Dallas Morning News, told Poynter this month.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Boas of The Arizona Republic said he expected ''a lot of cancellations,'' pointing to cancellations at The Cincinnati Enquirer, which like The Republic, is owned by Gannett.\par \par \uc2 But he said financial considerations were ''never a factor'' for the newspaper's nine-person editorial board. ''It was more of a curiosity,'' he said. ''We know we're doing the right thing. We feel very good about this decision.''\par \par \uc2 The endorsement of Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  would probably not have come as a surprise to the paper's faithful readers, he said. The paper had already written several cautionary editorials about Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , including one last November, when a black protester was beaten at one of Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's rallies in Birmingham, Ala. It also ran an editorial after Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  mocked a New York Times reporter with a disability.\par \par \uc2 ''\uc2 Trump\uc2  through the primary and into the general did a half dozen things that we believe would have been disqualifiers in years past,'' Mr. Boas said. ''We think that we are being traditionalists here. We're saying we're not willing to compromise our values.''\par \par \uc2 The decision to endorse a Democrat, however, was not taken lightly. The newspaper did not have a record of its endorsements, and it hired a researcher to determine when it had last supported a Democratic presidential candidate over a Republican. A historian was brought on to review the researcher's work. When they found out the paper had never endorsed a Democrat, Mr. Boas said, ''It was a real surprise.''\par \par \uc2 But in the end, he said, the editorial board's decision was not contentious. ''We're never in unison on anything, but it wasn't a difficult thing,'' Mr. Boas said. ''It was the kind of thing that just evolved over time.''\par \par \uc2 Document NYTF000020160929ec9t00052\par }\par \b \uc2 Search Summary\b0\par \par  \trowd\trgaph15\trqc\trleft-15
