\par\par \b \uc2 FBI\uc2 : \uc2 Clinton\uc2  'Careless,' Not Criminal\b0\par\par\uc2 By Kate O'Keeffe and Byron Tau   \par \uc2 1,017 \uc2 words\par \uc2 6 July 2016\par \uc2 The Wall Street Journal\par \uc2 J\par A1\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 The head of the \uc2 FBI\uc2  on Tuesday recommended against charging \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  for mishandling classified information while she was secretary of state, even as he harshly criticized the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee for being "extremely careless" with the nation's secrets.\par \par \uc2 In a 15-minute statement at \uc2 Federal Bureau of Investigation\uc2  headquarters, James Comey said "any reasonable person" in Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's position should have known the sensitive material involved merited greater security. The announcement ended a lengthy investigation of Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's use of private email for government work.\par \par \uc2 "Although we did not find clear evidence that Secretary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  or her colleagues intended to violate laws governing the handling of classified information, there is evidence that they were extremely careless in their handling of very sensitive, highly classified information," Mr. Comey said.\par \par \uc2 The recommendation against charges was a relief to the \uc2 Clinton\uc2  campaign and came a week after a House committee outlined few new criticisms of Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  involving the 2012 terrorist attacks in Libya. Top Justice Department officials still must make the final decision on whether to charge Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , but Mr. Comey's views will carry great weight. Attorney General Loretta Lynch has said she would follow the recommendations of the \uc2 FBI\uc2  and career prosecutors.\par \par \uc2 "We are pleased that the career officials handling this case have determined that no further action by the Department is appropriate," the \uc2 Clinton\uc2  campaign said. "As the secretary has long said, it was a mistake to use her personal email and she would not do it again. We are glad that this matter is now resolved."\par \par \uc2 Still, the decision against charges isn't likely to be the final say on the matter as the general-\uc2 election\uc2  season heats up. Republicans jumped on the portrait of Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  as reckless with sensitive information, with presumptive GOP nominee \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  saying in a statement shortly after Mr. Comey's remarks that "the system is rigged."\par \par \uc2 "The normal punishment, in this case, would include losing authority to handle classified information, and that too disqualifies \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  from being president," Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  added.\par \par \uc2 The email issue has dogged Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  for more than a year following revelations that she routed government correspondence to a server she kept at her home in suburban New York while she was secretary of state from 2009 to 2013. Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  said she used the private account because it was more convenient than keeping separate personal and official email addresses.\par \par \uc2 However, the determination by two internal government watchdogs that Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's server contained classified material led to a referral to the \uc2 FBI\uc2  and the beginning of a criminal investigation into possible loss or mishandling of classified information.\par \par \uc2 According to the \uc2 FBI\uc2 , 110 of the approximately 30,000 emails Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  provided for the investigation contained information considered classified when they were sent. Another 2,000 or so emails were deemed classified after being sent. Among thousands of additional emails Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  hadn't produced but that the \uc2 FBI\uc2  had found, three were classified at the time they had been sent, Mr. Comey said. There was no evidence Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  intentionally deleted those emails to hide them from investigators, he added.\par \par \uc2 There were "only a very small number" of emails that bore markings indicating the presence of classified information, said the FBI director. "But even if information is not marked 'classified' in an email, participants who know or should know that the subject matter is classified are still obligated to protect it," he said, taking on a point Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  had long made in defense of her email arrangement. The former secretary of state had repeatedly asserted that none of the emails in her account contained "classified" markings.\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 FBI\uc2  found no evidence that hostile actors successfully broke into Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's emails. But Mr. Comey said the bureau couldn't rule it out, given that her use of private email was well-known, the email accounts of some of her associates were hacked, and she used her email extensively while overseas.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Comey said actions like Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's generally prompt charges if there is evidence that someone intentionally mishandled information, obstructed justice or appeared to be disloyal to the U.S.\par \par \uc2 None of those factors was present here, he said. "We cannot find a case that would support bringing criminal charges on these facts," Mr. Comey said.\par \par \uc2 The FBI director did say that individuals who engage in such actions could face administrative penalties.\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 FBI\uc2  concluded its investigation under something of a cloud since Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's husband, former President \uc2 Bill \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , met last week with Ms. Lynch on her plane. Members of both political parties said the meeting was inappropriate because Ms. Lynch oversees the \uc2 FBI\uc2 , and the encounter could suggest Mr. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  was seeking to influence the investigation's outcome.\par \par \uc2 Both participants said they engaged only in small talk. Still, Ms. Lynch later said she regretted the meeting. Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's supporters noted that officials had signaled long before the meeting that charges were unlikely.\par \par \uc2 Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  was interviewed at the \uc2 FBI\uc2 's Washington headquarters on Saturday, in one of the final steps in the investigation.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Comey Tuesday stressed that the investigation had been apolitical and that his recommendation was made without outside influence.\par \par \uc2 He described a painstaking probe requiring thousands of hours of work, citing for example the need to examine emails from a personal server of Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's that had been decommissioned in 2013.\par \par \uc2 "It was like removing the frame from a huge finished jigsaw puzzle and dumping the pieces on the floor," Mr. Comey said. "The effect was that millions of email fragments end up unsorted in the server's unused -- or 'slack' -- space."\par \par \uc2 He began his statement by announcing that no one at the Justice Department or any other government agency knew what he was about to say.\par \par \uc2 (See related letters: "Letters to the Editor: What Is in the Best Interests of the Country?" -- WSJ July 13, 2016)\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=wjco20160706000041"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document J000000020160712ec7600035\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 National Desk; SECTA\par \b \uc2 On the Stump Together, Obama Praises a 'Tested' \uc2 Clinton\b0\par\par\uc2 By AMY CHOZICK and MICHAEL D. SHEAR \par \uc2 1,265 \uc2 words\par \uc2 6 July 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 14\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 CHARLOTTE, N.C. -- As \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  braced for political fallout from her use of a private email server, President Obama delivered a stemwinder on her behalf on Tuesday, praising her ''steady judgment'' as his secretary of state and criticizing \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2  for his own lack of transparency.\par \par \uc2 Sleeves rolled up and declaring himself ''fired up'' on her behalf, Mr. Obama heaped admiration on Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  and assailed Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , the presumptive Republican nominee, saying American voters face a critical choice between ''some imaginary past, or whether we are going to reach for the future.''\par \par \uc2 ''I can tell you this, \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  has been tested,'' Mr. Obama said as he interrupted repeatedly by the cheering crowd. ''There has never been any man or woman more qualified for this office,'' the president boomed.\par \par \uc2 But the jubilant rally -- Mr. Obama's first campaign appearance with Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  -- unfolded at an awkward moment, just hours after the F.B.I. director, James B. Comey, accused Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  of being ''extremely careless'' in her email use as he announced the end of an investigation that has engulfed her candidacy and put the Obama administration on the defensive.\par \par \uc2 The dueling political events on Tuesday were as discordant as they were separate: The president and his first-term secretary of state sidestepped the email issue at their rally, where Mr. Obama clasped hands with his onetime rival and predicted victory in the fall, making no mention of Mr. Comey's dramatic announcement in Washington faulting Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  even as he recommended against criminal charges.\par \par \uc2 Without mentioning the email controversy, Mr. Obama pointed to the political attacks that have chipped away at Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's trust among voters. ''Can I be blunt?'' he said. ''Hillary's got her share of critics.'' But, he added, ''That's what happens when you dedicate yourself to public service over a lifetime.''\par \par \uc2 Mr. Obama delicately touched on Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's perceived weaknesses as a candidate even as he marveled at her tenacity in the nominating fight they waged against each other eight years ago. In an \uc2 election\uc2  year in which outsider candidates have railed against the establishment, Mr. Obama portrayed Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's decades-long experience as a plus.\par \par \uc2 ''Sometimes we take somebody who has been in the trenches and fought the good fight and been so steady for granted,'' he said, recognizing that voters' yearning for the next new thing had helped his own 2008 campaign. ''We don't do that, by the way, for airline pilots.''\par \par \uc2 At a time when her State Department tenure is being picked apart by political critics, he defended her turn as the nation's top diplomat, noting how her popularity faded only once she returned to the political spotlight. ''It's funny how the filter changes a little bit,'' he said. ''The filter is a powerful thing.''\par \par \uc2 Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , perched on a stool behind the president, grinned and gently nodded.\par \par \uc2 The swing-state rally in North Carolina was rescheduled after a previous campaign event in Wisconsin was hastily canceled after the Orlando shootings. But in some ways, the moment had been years in the making.\par \par \uc2 Eight years ago, after a brutal primary fight, Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  appeared arm in arm with Mr. Obama for the first time in Unity, N.H., where she declared, ''Unity is not only a beautiful place, it's a wonderful feeling, isn't it?''\par \par \uc2 Mr. Obama referred to that event at Tuesday's rally in North Carolina, a rally that served as a kind of bookend to two remarkable careers that at times seemed destined to clash. ''We went to Unity, N.H., just in case people missed the point,'' Mr. Obama said. ''I saw the grace and the energy with which she threw herself into my campaign.''\par \par \uc2 Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  spoke before the president, an unusual departure from how she appears at events with high-powered surrogates, and at times it felt like she was campaigning not for herself, but for Mr. Obama's legacy, praising his ''heart, depth and humility.''\par \par \uc2 She repeatedly referred to their former rivalry, even praising Mr. Obama's political deftness at defeating her. ''He knows a thing or two about winning elections, take it from me,'' she said.\par \par \uc2 The F.B.I.'s decision not to recommend criminal charges came days after an unplanned, brief meeting between former President \uc2 Bill \uc2 Clinton\uc2  and Attorney General Loretta Lynch at an airport in Phoenix. To avoid any appearance of political interference, Ms. Lynch said Friday that she would accept the recommendations of career prosecutors and the F.B.I. director on whether to bring charges against Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 On Saturday, Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  and her lawyers met with officials from the F.B.I. and the Justice Department to answer nearly four hours of questioning related to her email server.\par \par \uc2 Aides to both Democrats said Mr. Obama and Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  did not discuss the F.B.I. investigation on the flight to Charlotte. A spokesman for Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , Nick Merrill, added that Mr. Obama looked at photos of Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's grandchildren aboard Air Force One.\par \par \uc2 Serving as Mr. Obama's secretary of state, Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  engendered good will with the White House, and the experience of accepting Mr. Obama's offer to run the State Department became one of the most popular stories she relayed on the campaign trail, particularly when wooing black voters.\par \par \uc2 Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  also fired away at Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , saying that Mr. Obama was ''someone who has never forgotten where he came from -- and Donald, if you're out there tweeting, it's Hawaii,'' a reference to Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's calls in 2011 for the president to produce his birth certificate.\par \par \uc2 For several attendees, many of whom waited for hours in sweltering conditions to get into the rally, the chief draw was the chance to glimpse Mr. Obama as he sets off on something of a farewell tour.\par \par \uc2 The crowd was heavily African-American, flashing clothing and trinkets dedicated to the sitting president. Vendors sold tote bags and T-shirts emblazoned with images of Mr. Obama's teenage daughters, and T-shirts promising to continue Mr. Obama's historic 2008 victory by electing the first female president.\par \par \uc2 ''It was on my bucket list,'' Ivy Dunn, 69, said of seeing him.\par \par \uc2 Asked if she thought Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  could be as effective in office, Ms. Dunn paused. ''I'm not going to say yes,'' she said, ''but she'll be good.''\par \par \uc2 Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  will need to nurture Mr. Obama and his supporters, particularly after she strayed to the left of his policies during her nominating fight on issues like the Trans Pacific Partnership trade deal and the Keystone XL Pipeline. A majority -- 51 percent -- of Americans approve of the president, according to a recent Gallup poll.\par \par \uc2 As Mr. Obama and Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  touched down at the Charlotte airport, and strode off Air Force One together in a sign of solidarity, a reporter asked John D. Podesta, Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's campaign chairman and a former White House chief of staff to Mr. Obama, whether the F.B.I. announcement overshadowed the rally.\par \par \uc2 He replied with a single word: ''Hardly.''\par \par \uc2 Find out what you need to know about the 2016 presidential race today, and get politics news updates via \uc2 Facebook\uc2 , \uc2 Twitter\uc2  and the First Draft newsletter.\par \par \uc2 ''There has never been any man or woman more qualified for this office,'' President Obama said of Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  on Tuesday.

LEWIS \par \uc2 1,473 \uc2 words\par \uc2 6 July 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 18\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 CORRECTION APPENDEDAbner J. Mikva, who was one of the nation's leading liberal politicians for decades and an influential figure at the top levels of all three branches of the federal government, died on Monday in Chicago. He was 90.\par \par \uc2 Sanford D. Horwitt, a friend and colleague, confirmed the death, at a hospice care facility, saying Mr. Mikva had bladder cancer and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Mikva represented the Chicago area in Congress for nearly nine years, became the chief judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia -- widely regarded as second in importance only to the Supreme Court -- and concluded his federal service with a stint as White House counsel under President \uc2 Bill \uc2 Clinton\uc2  during a tumultuous period in the executive branch.\par \par \uc2 He had also been a mentor to President Obama and to Justice \uc2 Elena Kagan\uc2  of the Supreme Court.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Mikva was an unusual combination of a highly regarded legal scholar who taught at the \uc2 University of Chicago\uc2  Law School and a skilled street-level politician who flourished in the raucous politics of Chicago. He was one of the few consistently successful opponents of Mayor Richard J. Daley's political machine at the height of its power.\par \par \uc2 A son of Yiddish-speaking immigrants from Ukraine, Abner Joseph Mikva was born in Milwaukee on Jan. 21, 1926. He often spoke about his early childhood years, when his father was out of work and the family was subsisting on welfare. He said the knit blue cap and clunky work shoes he wore for years marked him as a welfare recipient.\par \par \uc2 He attended public schools and the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, where he met Zorita Wise, known as Zoe, on a blind date. They married in September 1948, and she survives him.\par \par \uc2 He later transferred to \uc2 Washington University in St. Louis\uc2 . During World War II he was a navigator with the Army Air Corps. Though he did not complete an undergraduate degree, he eventually graduated from the \uc2 University of Chicago\uc2  Law School and served as a clerk to Justice Sherman Minton of the Supreme Court.\par \par \uc2 He began his career in politics as a volunteer for Senator Paul Douglas and Gov. Adlai E. Stevenson, two of the leading liberal politicians in Illinois.\par \par \uc2 His first taste of Chicago politics, as he recounted in a taped oral history of the city, came when he walked into the headquarters of the Eighth Ward Regular Democratic Organization to volunteer:\par \par \uc2 ''Who sent you?'' the committeeman asked.\par \par \uc2 ''Nobody,'' he replied.\par \par \uc2 ''Well,'' the committeeman said, ''We don't want nobody nobody sent.''\par \par \uc2 The ward leader told him that they had no paying jobs to give out.\par \par \uc2 ''I don't want a job,'' Mr. Mikva replied.\par \par \uc2 ''Well, we don't want nobody that don't want a job,'' the leader said.\par \par \uc2 In 1956, Mr. Mikva won his first \uc2 election\uc2  as a state assemblyman and was sent to Springfield, Ill., the capital, where his roommate was Paul Simon, later a longtime United States senator.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Mikva took on the Daley machine in 1966, when he lost a primary challenge to an 84-year-old congressman, Barratt G. O'Hara. Two years later, he defeated Mr. O'Hara and went to Washington. The machine took its revenge by changing the boundaries of his district, and Mr. Mikva was defeated by a Republican in 1972.\par \par \uc2 Ousted after two terms, Mr. Mikva began practicing law, but his wife bluntly told him that he was not cut out for it -- that his temperament was more suited for boisterous elective politics. Heeding her advice, he ran for Congress again in 1974 in a new district on the region's North Shore. Despite the district's high Republican voter registration, he won, narrowly.\par \par \uc2 He served another two terms, winning re-\uc2 election\uc2  in 1976 by only 201 votes out of 213,407 cast.\par \par \uc2 In Congress he served on the House Judiciary Committee and sought to toughen criminal laws, saying that as a liberal supporter of protections for criminal defendants, as established by the Supreme Court under Chief Justice Earl Warren, he had a special obligation to address public fears about crime.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Mikva was noted for his unrelenting efforts to outlaw all privately owned handguns -- each session he introduced a bill to do so -- a position that won him the enmity of the \uc2 National Rifle Association\uc2 . When President \uc2 Jimmy Carter\uc2  nominated him to the appeals court in 1979, the N.R.A. spent more than $1 million in an unsuccessful lobbying effort to thwart his confirmation.\par \par \uc2 On the District of Columbia appeals bench, which was deeply divided ideologically, Judge Mikva became a leader of its liberal faction. He once got into a shouting match with a conservative judge in a private conference over whether to uphold an affirmative action plan for the city's fire department.\par \par \uc2 Rising to chief judge of the court in 1991, he wrote an opinion reinstating a gay midshipman who had been expelled from the Naval Academy at Annapolis, striking down a \uc2 Clinton\uc2  administration regulation barring gays from serving in the military.\par \par \uc2 On most days before taking the bench, Judge Mikva used his privileges as a former congressman to visit the House gym, play paddleball and socialize with former colleagues.\par \par \uc2 Judge Mikva was 68, one of the most powerful judges in the country and on a comfortable path to retirement, when he decided to leave the bench for what he later called the pressure-cooker atmosphere of the White House. President \uc2 Clinton\uc2  brought Mr. Mikva in as White House counsel in the fall of 1994 to provide stability in judgment at a time when the president was facing several inquiries stemming from his investment years earlier in a local real estate venture known as Whitewater when he was governor of Arkansas. Mr. Mikva served a year in the post.\par \par \uc2 After leaving the White House, he served as a mentor to \uc2 Barack Obama\uc2 , then a young Illinois state legislator. Mr. Mikva had first become aware of Mr. Obama when he was told about a promising Chicago-area law student in his last year at Harvard Law School. An appeals court judge at the time, Judge Mikva reached out to recruit Mr. Obama as a law clerk. Mr. Obama declined, however, saying he wanted to try his hand at community organizing in Chicago.\par \par \uc2 ''I've lost a mentor and a friend,'' President Obama said Tuesday in a statement.\par \par \uc2 ''No matter how far we go in life, we owe a profound debt of gratitude to those who gave us those first, firm pushes at the start,'' Mr. Obama said. ''For me, one of those people was Ab Mikva.\par \par \uc2 ''When I was graduating law school, Ab encouraged me to pursue public service. He saw something in me that I didn't yet see in myself, but I know why he did it -- Ab represented the best of public service himself, and he believed in empowering the next generation of young people to shape our country.''\par \par \uc2 In 2014 Mr. Obama awarded Mr. Mikva the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the country's highest civilian honor.\par \par \uc2 As a federal judge, Judge Mikva hired \uc2 Elena Kagan\uc2  as a law clerk, recommended her to clerk for Justice Thurgood Marshall, endorsed her move to a professorship at the \uc2 University of Chicago\uc2  and persuaded her to join him in the counsel's office at the \uc2 Clinton\uc2  White House.\par \par \uc2 In 1997, Mr. Mikva and his wife founded the Mikva Challenge, an organization that raises money to encourage inner-city youths to become active in elective politics.\par \par \uc2 Besides his wife, he is survived by their daughters Mary, Laurie and Rachel, all of whom use the surname Mikva, and seven grandchildren.\par \par \uc2 In 2004, the couple served as international observers for elections in Ukraine. He wrote that the voting itself seemed straightforward, but when he followed the ballots to the central counting station, he saw 2,100 of them summarily discarded. He objected to no avail.\par \par \uc2 ''I thought I had seen a lot of tough elections in Chicago,'' he said, ''but they were mild compared to this one.''\par \par \uc2 Correction: July 7, 2016, Thursday\par \par \uc2 This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An obituary on Wednesday about the former Illinois congressman and federal judge Abner J. Mikva misstated, in some editions, when he moved to the North Shore area of Chicago. It was before the 1972 congressional \uc2 election\uc2  -- which he lost -- not in 1974, when he ran for Congress again and won.\par \par \uc2 Abner J. Mikva, above, in 1991, when he became the chief judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia. Left, receiving the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2014.

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 You introduce yourself to voters as a son of Kansas and Kenya, an emblem of this country's openness to outsiders and its embrace of difference. Your \uc2 election\uc2  and re-\uc2 election\uc2  affirm the distance that the United States has traveled, or so you believe. So you hope.\par \par \uc2 Then you look up toward the end of your second term to behold a Republican presidential nominee who is cynically exploiting racism and xenophobia to put the White House within his own reach. He's not merely your adversary; he's your antithesis. And his victory would do more than endanger your policies. It would question the very moral of your journey, the very bend of the arc you frequently invoke.\par \par \uc2 That's what \uc2 Barack Obama\uc2  confronts right now, and that's why he hit the campaign trail on Tuesday, appearing onstage with \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  in North Carolina and proclaiming without reservation that ''there has never been any man or woman more qualified for this office'' than she. That's why he'll say words like those again and again, with the same fire, in the months ahead.\par \par \uc2 For the nation's first black president, \uc2 Clinton\uc2  isn't just the better candidate. She's the better America. She wins and he holds on to his rosiest convictions about what he and his presidency symbolize. \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  wins and that's a tricky thing to do.\par \par \uc2 Trump\uc2  forged his bond with bigots by essentially calling Obama an impostor and demanding to see his birth certificate. But that particular stunt weighs less on Obama than \uc2 Trump\uc2 's sustained behavior during the 2016 presidential race does, according to people close to the president.\par \par \uc2 ''The thing that I'm sure aggravates him -- enrages him -- is the invocation of race and ethnicity in our politics,'' David Axelrod, a former White House aide, told me. ''Obama's message is about the emerging America and the strength of our diversity. He represents it. And when \uc2 Trump\uc2  says 'Make America great again,' there's an element of turning the clock back to the days when minorities were at the back of the bus.''\par \par \uc2 ''That goes to the character of our country,'' Axelrod added. ''The president is someone who would be uniquely sensitive to that.''\par \par \uc2 Uniquely sensitive and utterly impassioned. In North Carolina he didn't so much urge voters as command them, with a testimonial about \uc2 Clinton\uc2  that was gushing and epic. I swear I saw her blush.\par \par \uc2 Was \uc2 Trump\uc2  on Obama's mind? I suspect. ''Everybody can tweet,'' he said, adding that it's no preparation or qualification for the presidency. He brought up his younger daughter. ''Sasha tweets, but she doesn't think that she thereby should be sitting behind the desk.''\par \par \uc2 Was \uc2 Trump\uc2  on \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's mind? Clearly. She complimented Obama as ''someone who has never forgotten where he came from -- and Donald, if you're out there tweeting, it's Hawaii.''\par \par \uc2 The 2016 campaign keeps showing us things that we're not accustomed to, and a second-term president campaigning with unfettered vigor for his desired successor is another of those. George W. Bush didn't do it: He was so toxic at this point in his administration that \uc2 John McCain\uc2 's most fervent wish was to tuck him into a broom closet.\par \par \uc2 Bill \uc2 Clinton\uc2  didn't do it, because Al Gore was intent on coming across as his own, less priapic man. Neither did Ronald Reagan, because Bush's father similarly felt the need to flex his own muscle, outside of anyone's shadow, and Reagan's energy was flagging anyway.\par \par \uc2 Dwight Eisenhower? When asked what Richard Nixon had accomplished as his vice president, he said that he needed a week to think about it.\par \par \uc2 Obama and \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  have arrived at a place of obvious respect for each other, and of palpable fondness. His high approval ratings put him in a position to help. Her stature puts her in a position not to be eclipsed by his presence or belittled by that assistance.\par \par \uc2 Campaigning together is an imperfect arrangement, inasmuch as she may seem to be arguing for the status quo instead of a better tomorrow. But Americans hold Obama in significantly higher esteem than they do her or \uc2 Trump\uc2 . There are far riskier things than letting the president carry the ball.\par \par \uc2 And he's a player in this regardless, given the larger context, which was clear when \uc2 Clinton\uc2  asked the North Carolina audience to think of ''the early patriots who met in Philadelphia'' in 1776.\par \par \uc2 ''Nobody who looked like \uc2 Barack Obama\uc2  or me would have been included back then,'' she said. ''But we're here today because the story of America is the story of hard-fought, hard-won progress.''\par \par \uc2 That's the tale that Obama has always told. It's the narrative that so many of us cling to. Where does \uc2 Trump\uc2  fit into it, and does it survive him? Instead of just wondering and worrying, the departing president has joined the fight.\par \par \uc2 I invite you to follow me on Twitter at twitter.com/frankbruni (@FrankBruni) and join me on \uc2 Facebook\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Follow The \uc2 New York Times\uc2  Opinion section on \uc2 Facebook\uc2  and Twitter (@NYTOpinion), and sign up for the Opinion Today newsletter.\par \par \uc2 Thomas L.

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 To the Editor:\par \par \uc2 You are to be congratulated on your extensive article about Syrian refugees and their warm welcome by their Canadian sponsors (''Refugees Hear a Foreign Word: Welcome,'' front page, July 1). It puts a human face on people we have been encouraged to fear and reject in this \uc2 election\uc2  cycle.\par \par \uc2 The article has personal resonance for me. Ten years ago I founded an organization that provides housing and a range of humanitarian services for asylum seekers fleeing persecution and war. Almost all are survivors of torture. We locate hosts who have spare bedrooms to provide housing and then mobilize volunteers to offer the support necessary to enable our guests to achieve total independence in American society.\par \par \uc2 Despite the egregious and opportunistic fear-mongering of Gov. Chris Christie, who has declared that the state of New Jersey will not help resettle any Syrian refugees, I am proud to say that we have resettled two Syrian families, one that shared our home with my wife and me. We found them to be delightful people whose greatest interest was to establish themselves in their new homeland and build a viable future for themselves and their children.\par \par \uc2 Though our clients could not be more different from their hosts with regard to race, ethnicity, cultural background and, most dramatically, life experience, over time winning relationships are molded and our common humanity comes to the fore.\par \par \uc2 JOSEPH CHUMAN\par \par \uc2 Hackensack, N.J.\par \par \uc2 The writer is the founder of the Northern New Jersey Coalition for Political Asylum Seekers and a professor of human rights at Columbia University.\par \par \uc2 To the Editor:\par \par \uc2 I read your article about Canadian families opening their arms, homes and wallets to Syrian families with tears in my eyes: tears of joy for the expression of pure humanity, and tears of sadness that this isn't happening in our own country. We seem to have strayed very far from the promise of Emma Lazarus's famous words: ''Give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to breathe free.''\par \par \uc2 That a presumptive presidential nominee and all his supporters can think that ''making America great again'' means closing our borders, hearts and minds to the plight of millions of men, women and children is testimony to just how lost we have become. Kudos to Canada, shame on us.\par \par \uc2 SUSAN STEINBERG\par \par \uc2 Bellerose, Queens\par \par \uc2 To the Editor:\par \par \uc2 Your article on Canada's welcoming of Syrian refugees is far more important than many readers may realize.\par \par \uc2 Let's start with two often overlooked propositions. First, ISIS's main aim is to have the West hate Muslims (which is why Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  is the best thing that ever happened to ISIS); second, counterinsurgent wars, of which ISIS is one, are never won by military might (look at Iraq and Afghanistan, and Vietnam before them).\par \par \uc2 Canada's people-to-people program is a great step in the right direction: Showing understanding and kindness -- assimilating rather than isolating Muslim refugees -- is the way to defeat ISIS.\par \par \uc2 But Canada, be forewarned: Your kindness toward Syrian refugees will not protect you from future terrorist acts. Indeed you may be explicitly targeted to discourage other Western countries from following in your footsteps. If this happens, don't misread the signals. Yours is the right anti-ISIS strategy. Please stay with it.\par \par \uc2 DENNIS DE TRAY\par \par \uc2 Astana, Kazakhstan\par \par \uc2 The writer, an American, is a principal of Results for Development, a Washington think tank, and has worked in the Middle East and Asia for the \uc2 Defense Department\uc2  and the \uc2 World Bank\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Document NYTF000020160706ec760002x\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 National Desk; SECTA\par \b \uc2 Stern Rebuke, but No Charges, for \uc2 Clinton\b0\par\par\uc2 By MARK LANDLER and ERIC LICHTBLAU \par \uc2 1,828 \uc2 words\par \uc2 6 July 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 1\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 WASHINGTON -- The F.B.I. director, James B. Comey, on Tuesday recommended no criminal charges against \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  for her handling of classified information while she was secretary of state, lifting an enormous legal cloud from her presidential campaign less than two hours before she boarded Air Force One for her first joint campaign appearance with President Obama.\par \par \uc2 But on a day of political high drama in Washington, Mr. Comey rebuked Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  as being ''extremely careless'' in using a private email address and server. He raised questions about her judgment, contradicted statements she has made about her email practices, said it was possible that hostile foreign governments had gained access to her account, and declared that a person still employed by the government -- Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  left the State Department in 2013 -- could have faced disciplinary action for doing what she did.\par \par \uc2 To warrant a criminal charge, Mr. Comey said, there had to be evidence that Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  intentionally transmitted or willfully mishandled classified information. The F.B.I. found neither, and as a result, he said, ''our judgment is that no reasonable prosecutor would bring such a case.''\par \par \uc2 The Justice Department is highly likely to accept the F.B.I.'s guidance, which a law enforcement official said also cleared three top aides of Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  who were implicated in the case: Jake Sullivan, Huma Abedin and \uc2 Cheryl D. Mills\uc2 . Attorney General Loretta Lynch said last week that she would accept the recommendation of the F.B.I. and career prosecutors in the case after a storm of criticism about an impromptu meeting between her and former President \uc2 Bill \uc2 Clinton\uc2  on an airport tarmac in Phoenix.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Comey's 15-minute announcement, delivered with no advance warning only three days after his investigators interviewed Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  in the case, riveted official Washington and is likely to reverberate for the rest of the campaign. In offices across the capital, all eyes turned to television screens to hear the outcome of a yearlong investigation that could have thrown the 2016 presidential \uc2 election\uc2  into disarray and changed history.\par \par \uc2 As Mr. Comey strode to the lectern at the F.B.I. headquarters at 11 a.m., Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  was waiting backstage a few blocks away to address the National Education Association. Her aides said she did not know what Mr. Comey was going to say. Five minutes into Mr. Comey's remarks, and before he announced that the F.B.I. would not seek charges, a smiling Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  began her speech.\par \par \uc2 By 2:45 p.m., she and Mr. Obama were descending the stairs of Air Force One for a campaign rally in Charlotte, N.C., while back in Washington the State Department spokesman, John Kirby, was fending off questions from reporters about what Mr. Comey described as the department's lax security in handling classified information.\par \par \uc2 White House officials said Mr. Obama also did not know about Mr. Comey's plans ahead of time. The F.B.I. director said he did not coordinate the statement with the Justice Department or any other agency. ''They do not know what I am about to say,'' he declared.\par \par \uc2 A Republican former federal prosecutor, Mr. Comey seemed at first to be laying the groundwork for some kind of legal charge. Speaking sternly, and in far more detail than he usually does, he listed several previously undisclosed findings from the F.B.I.'s investigation:\par \par \uc2 \u226\'00\'E2\u8211\'20\'13\u160\'00\'A0 Of 30,000 emails Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  handed over to the State Department, 110 contained information that was classified at the time she sent or received them. Of those, Mr. Comey said, ''a very small number'' bore markings that identified them as classified. This finding is at odds with Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's repeated assertions that none of the emails were classified at the time she sent or received them. The F.B.I. did not disclose the topics of the classified emails, but a number of the 110 are believed to have involved drone strikes.\par \par \uc2 \u226\'00\'E2\u8211\'20\'13\u160\'00\'A0 The F.B.I. discovered ''several thousand'' work-related emails that were not in the original trove of 30,000 turned over by Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  to the State Department. Three of those contained information that agencies have concluded was classified, though Mr. Comey said he did not believe Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  deliberately deleted or withheld them from investigators.\par \par \uc2 \u226\'00\'E2\u8211\'20\'13\u160\'00\'A0 In saying that it was ''possible'' that hostile foreign governments had gained access to Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's personal account, Mr. Comey noted that she used her mobile device extensively while traveling outside the United States, including trips ''in the territory of sophisticated adversaries.''\par \par \uc2 \u226\'00\'E2\u8211\'20\'13\u160\'00\'A0 Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  used multiple private servers for her personal and government business, not just a single server at her home in New York that has been the focus of media reporting for more than a year. Her use of these servers -- some of which were taken out of service and stored -- made the F.B.I.'s job enormously complicated as it struggled to put together, in Mr. Comey's words, a jigsaw puzzle with ''millions of email fragments'' in it.\par \par \uc2 Despite all that, Mr. Comey said the F.B.I. did not find that Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's conduct revealed ''intentional misconduct or indications of disloyalty to the United States or efforts to obstruct justice.'' But a person in her position, he said, ''should have known that an unclassified system was no place'' for the emails she was sending. And he said it raised troubling questions about how the State Department handled classified information.\par \par \uc2 The White House press secretary, \uc2 Josh Earnest\uc2 , declined to comment, except to say it was clear from Mr. Comey's remarks that ''they've looked at this in excruciating detail.'' Mr. Obama, he said, remained ''enthusiastic'' about Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's candidacy.\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 Clinton\uc2  campaign clearly hoped that the announcement would bring to a close a saga that has haunted Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  since March 2015, when the existence of her personal email account surfaced.\par \par \uc2 ''We are pleased that the career officials handling this case have determined that no further action by the department is appropriate,'' said the campaign's spokesman, Brian Fallon. ''As the secretary has long said, it was a mistake to use her personal email and she would not do it again. We are glad that this matter is now resolved.''\par \par \uc2 Republicans seized on Mr. Comey's sharp criticism, saying it raised doubts about Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's fitness for high office. \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , the presumptive Republican nominee, asserted in a post on \uc2 Twitter\uc2  that David H. Petraeus, the former C.I.A. director, had been charged for doing far less than Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , and the lack of charges showed that the system was ''rigged.''\par \par \uc2 In fact, F.B.I. officials have long said that what Mr. Petraeus did -- knowingly handing a diary with classified information to his biographer and lover, then lying about it to investigators -- was worse than what Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  did. In the Petraeus case, the F.B.I. recommended a felony indictment, but the Justice Department allowed him to plead to a misdemeanor. The deal that Mr. Petraeus received shadowed Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's case from the start because it appeared to set a higher bar for bringing charges against her.\par \par \uc2 ''In looking back at our investigations into the mishandling or removal of classified information,'' Mr. Comey said, ''we cannot find a case that would support bringing criminal charges on these facts.''\par \par \uc2 Congressional Republicans swiftly called for the F.B.I. to release more details about its findings. ''If it wants to avoid giving the impression that the F.B.I. was pulling punches,'' said Senator \uc2 Charles E. Grassley\uc2 , the Republican chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, ''the agency must now be more transparent than ever in releasing information.''\par \par \uc2 Speaker Paul D. Ryan was equally critical. ''While I respect the professionals at the F.B.I., this announcement defies explanation,'' he said in a \uc2 Twitter\uc2  post. ''No one should be above the law.''\par \par \uc2 For an agency that seemed to be in no rush, the F.B.I.'s investigation wrapped up quickly. By the time the investigators interviewed Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  in three and a half hours of questioning on Saturday, they had compiled months of findings. Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  appeared to say nothing to contradict what they had already discovered about how the private server was used, a law enforcement official said. The investigators then worked with Mr. Comey through the holiday weekend to review her testimony and determine whether there was any new information that might warrant criminal charges, law enforcement officials said. They found none.\par \par \uc2 For weeks, F.B.I. agents expected the investigation would not yield charges. They shared Mr. Comey's conclusion that Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  had showed poor judgment but that she had not committed a crime.\par \par \uc2 In the spring, Mr. Comey declared that the campaign calendar would not dictate the pace of the investigation. But the Democratic National Convention begins on July 25 in Philadelphia, and F.B.I. officials did not want to be seen as influencing the outcome of the \uc2 election\uc2  after the nomination.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Comey's announcement was believed to be the first time that the F.B.I. had ever publicly disclosed its recommendations to the Justice Department about whether to charge someone in any high-profile case, let alone a presidential candidate. His decision to announce the results of the investigation was made before the uproar over Ms. Lynch's meeting with Mr. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , according to a law enforcement official. He decided to make his findings public, the official said, because he wanted to make the F.B.I.'s position clear before referring the case to the Justice Department.\par \par \uc2 While the F.B.I.'s recommendation spares Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  and her aides criminal charges, it does not remove the possibility that they could be denied security clearances if Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  is elected and she appoints them to jobs that require such clearance. The State Department plans to conduct its own administrative review after the Justice Department acts.\par \par \uc2 ''We don't share the broad assessment made of our institution that there's a lax culture here when it comes to protecting classified information,'' said Mr. Kirby, the State Department spokesman. ''We take it very, very seriously.''\par \par \uc2 Follow The \uc2 New York Times\uc2 's politics and Washington coverage on \uc2 Facebook\uc2  and \uc2 Twitter\uc2 , and sign up for the First Draft politics newsletter.\par \par \uc2 Follow Mark Landler on Twitter @MarkLandler.\par \par \uc2 James B.

\par\par \uc2 NEWS ANALYSIS\par \uc2 National Desk; SECTA\par \b \uc2 An Attack Ad, Ready-Made\b0\par\par\uc2 By PATRICK HEALY \par \uc2 1,346 \uc2 words\par \uc2 6 July 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 1\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  may not be indicted on criminal charges over her handling of classified email, but the F.B.I. director, James B. Comey, all but indicted her judgment and competence on Tuesday -- two vital pillars of her presidential candidacy -- and in the kind of terms that would be politically devastating in a normal \uc2 election\uc2  year.\par \par \uc2 The silver lining for Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  is that this is not a normal \uc2 election\uc2  year.\par \par \uc2 Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's campaign is built on the premise that she has the national security experience and well-honed instincts to keep Americans safe in the age of terrorism, and that \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2  does not. Nearly every day, she seeks to present herself as a more thoughtful and responsible leader.\par \par \uc2 She has spent months describing Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  as ''reckless,'' ''unprepared'' and ''temperamentally unfit'' to be president, and she has pointed to her four years as secretary of state and eight in the Senate as unparalleled preparation for becoming commander in chief.\par \par \uc2 Yet in just a few minutes of remarks, Mr. Comey called into question Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's claims of superiority more memorably, mightily and effectively than Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  has over the entire past year. And with potentially lasting consequences.\par \par \uc2 To her charge that he is ''reckless,'' Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  may now respond by citing Mr. Comey's rebuke: that Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  and her team ''were extremely careless in their handling of very sensitive, highly classified information.''\par \par \uc2 To her promises to defend the United States, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  may now retort with Mr. Comey's warning that ''it is possible that hostile actors gained access'' to Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's email account and the top secret information it contained.\par \par \uc2 And to her reproofs about his temperament and responsibility, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  may now point to Mr. Comey's finding that ''there is evidence of potential violations of the statutes'' on handling classified information -- though Mr. Comey said that other factors, like Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's intent, argued against criminal charges.\par \par \uc2 Worst of all was the totality of Mr. Comey's judgment about Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's judgment.\par \par \uc2 She is running as a supremely competent candidate and portraying Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , in essence, as irresponsible and dangerous. Yet the director of the F.B.I. basically just called her out for having committed one of the most irresponsible moves in the modern history of the State Department. And a day that should have been one of Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's best of the campaign -- as she stumped alongside President Obama for the first time and received his hearty endorsement -- ended up as one of her worst.\par \par \uc2 Her clearest selling point -- that she, unlike Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , can manage challenging relationships with allies and adversaries -- has now been undercut because she personally mismanaged the safeguarding of national security information.\par \par \uc2 These were only Mr. Comey's words, of course: He did not recommend federal charges against Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  or any of her aides, which came as a huge relief to Democrats who feared worse.\par \par \uc2 Still, as the Republican strategist Russ Schriefer put it on Tuesday, ''Any time a campaign is using 'Well, at least she wasn't indicted' as a cause for celebration isn't a good day for the campaign.''\par \par \uc2 As bad as this looks for Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , with voters reminded once more of the history of scandal that shadows the Clintons, she could still rebound quickly. She is no longer ''under investigation,'' after all, and Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  could very well bungle the political gift he has just been given.\par \par \uc2 A more conventional Republican nominee would probably already be using Mr. Comey's remarks to churn out new attack ads and bombarding television and radio audiences until every voter had heard the phrase ''extremely careless'' more than he or she could count. A typical nominee would have allies memorizing Mr. Comey's best lines and repeating them on cable news and at local political events -- assailing Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's judgment and experience to exploit and deepen the mistrust that many Americans feel toward her, and to drive up her unfavorability ratings in public opinion polls.\par \par \uc2 But Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  is not typical. He has reserved relatively little television advertising time in swing states. He prefers to launch attacks over \uc2 Twitter\uc2  and at campaign rallies rather than to use commercials or surrogates as force multipliers. And he has a tendency to choose the wrong targets and overcomplicate his arguments. On Tuesday, for instance, he chose to attack Mr. Comey for not bringing charges against Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , writing on \uc2 Twitter\uc2 , ''The system is rigged.''\par \par \uc2 A few hours later, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  issued a longer statement full of insinuations and conspiracy theories: ''Our adversaries almost certainly have a blackmail file on \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 ,'' he said. He argued that her lawyers and former President \uc2 Bill \uc2 Clinton\uc2  were up to no good, and contended that Mr. Comey's findings disqualified Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  from the presidency, a popular Republican talking point.\par \par \uc2 But he did not attack her judgment, which could influence undecided voters, until Tuesday evening at his rally in Raleigh, N.C. ''Her judgment is horrible -- look at her judgment on emails, who would do it?'' Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  said. But he did not prosecute the argument in any depth, and quickly moved on.\par \par \uc2 This is exactly what the Clintons hope Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  will continue to do: denounce the investigative process, which few voters understand. Beat up on a relatively unknown figure like Mr. Comey, who is not running for anything. And overreach politically, by playing up conspiracy theories -- delighting some voters but causing many others to roll their eyes.\par \par \uc2 As long as Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  continues to do so, Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  and her advisers believe that she can weather Mr. Comey's public reprimand without sustaining much long-term damage.\par \par \uc2 ''The issue now for \uc2 Trump\uc2  is to make a case against Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  that, even though she may not be charged with a crime, do you want a president who was extremely careless and incompetent in handling the most important top secret materials?'' said Edward J. Rollins, a veteran Republican strategist who is working with a group supporting Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's campaign. ''Guilty, no; incompetent and arrogant, yes!''\par \par \uc2 But Mr. Rollins said he was not sure whether Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  was capable of making that attack consistently and effectively.\par \par \uc2 Even as Democrats cringed listening to Mr. Comey deconstruct Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's sloppiness, they consoled themselves by expressing confidence that the moment would pass.\par \par \uc2 ''The vice-presidential picks, conventions and debates will overtake this news before long,'' said Bill Burton, a former adviser to President Obama. ''And a presidential race is a choice. And if the question is judgment, \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  would be a pretty stupid answer.''\par \par \uc2 While \uc2 Clinton\uc2  advisers were skeptical that Mr. Comey's remarks would sway many undecided voters, they also said relatively little publicly to avoid fanning any flames -- preferring instead, they said, to wait and see if Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  might stumble and say something to take the heat off her.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  has had weeks of unrelentingly negative news coverage, most recently about whether a \uc2 Twitter\uc2  post was anti-Semitic, and \uc2 Clinton\uc2  advisers said that they were counting on him to make some kind of flippant remark about Mr. Comey or the F.B.I. that might boomerang on him.\par \par \uc2 But there was no avoiding the conclusion that Tuesday -- which had held much promise for Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , thanks to Mr. Obama's much-anticipated endorsement -- was instead one of the lowest points of her campaign so far.\par \par \uc2 After eight years of a relatively scandal-free administration, voters listening to Mr. Comey describe the intricacies of the F.B.I.'s email investigation received a bracing reminder that things tend to get complicated with the Clintons.\par \par \uc2 Find out what you need to know about the 2016 presidential race today, and get politics news updates via \uc2 Facebook\uc2 , \uc2 Twitter\uc2  and the First Draft newsletter.\par \par \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2  in Raleigh, N.C., on Tuesday, along with Senator Bob Corker of Tennessee, a potential running mate.

\par\par \uc2 Letters to the Editor\par \b \uc2 Trump\uc2  Didn't Win on a Pro-Growth Agenda\b0\par\par\uc2 473 \uc2 words\par \uc2 5 July 2016\par \uc2 The Wall Street Journal\par \uc2 J\par A10\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 Donald L. Luskin believes that Americans are primed for an economic agenda that promises to make America more competitive and dynamic in a global economy and that such an agenda is a roadbed for Donald " \uc2 Trump\uc2 's Pro-Growth Path to Victory" (op-ed, June 21). Mr. Luskin notes that voters sense "that something has gone unexpectedly wrong with trade." Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's solution for pulling America out of a malaise starts with negotiating a more symmetrical trade relationship with China, but also includes sharply lower corporate and personal tax rates and sharply lower regulatory barriers to business investment and expansion.\par \par \uc2 A positive pro-growth message doesn't come immediately to mind when considering the reasons for Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's campaign success to date. If it had been, he may not have risen above the pack of GOP candidates. In addition, it is no longer certain that pro-growth axioms resonate with most voters in 21st-century America. Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's demographic Achilles' heel is white, college-educated women. Pulling those women out of \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's camp by talking up trade grievances, tax cuts and less government regulation is a long shot. A pro-growth agenda may help in the struggling Rust Belt, although it was nanny-state policies and income redistribution which resonated in the Democratic primaries.\par \par \uc2 Tapping into anger about unfair trade with China, a porous border with Mexico and a tone-deaf GOP establishment brought \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  to the presidential dance (assuming he is the GOP nominee), but he needs about 50 million additional dance partners in the general \uc2 election\uc2  for any hope of cutting a rug at his own inaugural ball.\par \par \uc2 Ryan Graham\par \par \uc2 Melbourne, Fla.\par \par \uc2 ---\par \par \uc2 Mr. Luskin details the economic symptoms caused by chronically low oil prices but fails to diagnose what is constraining low oil prices from stimulating growth more broadly. That constraint is the uncertain future of the increasingly vast federal regulatory state, a future that will continue to hang in the balance over the next 11 months. Despite lower energy bills, consumers are reluctant to increase consumption, which makes up 70% of GDP. But even more important, until that uncertainty is lifted, investors are less likely to green-light capital intensive projects. It is this political risk premium that is artificially increasing the cost of capital, which in turn is limiting the redeployment of capital and other resources to those sectors of the economy that would benefit most from low oil prices.\par \par \uc2 Jacob R. Borden, Ph.D., P.E.\par \par \uc2 McNeese State University\par \par \uc2 Lake Charles, La.\par \par \uc2 ---\par \par \uc2 If only Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  were as eloquent in expressing his goals and objectives as Mr. Luskin, what a difference it could make for America.\par \par \uc2 Lawrence Updike\par \par \uc2 Babson Park, Fla.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=wjco20160705000092"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document J000000020160926ec750000m\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw272\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4080\pichgoal600

\par\par \b \uc2 World News: Australia Vote Threatens Gridlock --- Winner faces restive Senate as no party gets enough seats to form a government\b0\par\par\uc2 By Rob Taylor   \par \uc2 605 \uc2 words\par \uc2 5 July 2016\par \uc2 The Wall Street Journal\par \uc2 J\par A6\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 SYDNEY -- For the eventual winner of Australia's cliffhanger national elections, forming a government is only the first step: an even bigger challenge looms in navigating legislation through a rebellious Senate.\par \par \uc2 The rise of antiestablishment lawmakers, especially in the upper house where laws are passed, risks gridlock on policies aimed at shoring up the country's fragile economy at the end of its long mining boom.\par \par \uc2 While the final results of Saturday's \uc2 election\uc2  won't be known for days, Prime Minister \uc2 Malcolm Turnbull\uc2 's gamble of holding an early vote already appears to have backfired. Neither his conservative Liberal-National coalition nor the main center-left Labor opposition has gained enough seats in Parliament's lower house to form a government outright.\par \par \uc2 In the Senate, early counting indicates the next prime minister will have to deal with an even more disparate band of lawmakers whose political views range from anti-immigration to free-trade skepticism.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Turnbull called elections in both houses simultaneously -- a rare "double dissolution" -- hoping to break legislative gridlock in the Senate by sweeping away opponents of his agenda. But the risky strategy appears to have helped fringe candidates gain office. With more seats up for grabs than in usual Senate elections, the quota to win a seat was reduced.\par \par \uc2 Some, like far-right Queensland lawmaker Pauline Hanson, hold anti-immigration views. Others have religious leanings and oppose Mr. Turnbull's progressive views on issues such as same-sex marriage.\par \par \uc2 Ms. Hanson's One Nation party looks likely to win at least one Senate seat, possibly two. She is pushing for a ban on Muslim refugees, and opposes same-sex marriage. The flame-haired former fish-and-chip shop owner served three years in the lower house from 1996, warning at the time that Australia was in danger of being "swamped by Asians."\par \par \uc2 Ms. Hanson couldn't be reached to comment, but her campaign platform said the party opposed foreign ownership of Australian land and assets, and advocated a "zero net immigration policy," where people who leave Australia are replaced by migrants who are "culturally cohesive with Australians and will assimilate."\par \par \uc2 Centrist Sen. Nick Xenophon is skeptical of the benefits of free trade as Australia is trying to cut deals with India and Europe to reduce its reliance on China to drive growth as the long resources boom ends. Mr. Xenophon's fledgling NXT party may win as many as four Senate seats. "My job is to keep government [accountable] in a robust and constructive way, " Mr. Xenophon said Monday.\par \par \uc2 After the U.K.'s June 23 vote to leave the \uc2 European Union\uc2  and the success of U.S. presidential candidate \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2 , Australia's \uc2 election\uc2  is the latest example of a global shift away from the "economic rationalist policies of deregulation, smaller government and globalization," said Shane Oliver, chief economist with fund manager AMP Capital.\par \par \uc2 Other potentially maverick senators include former radio and television personality Derryn Hinch, Tasmanian independent Jacqui Lambie, a military veteran who once voiced admiration for Russian President \uc2 Vladimir Putin\uc2 , and members of the conservative Christian Democratic Party headed by Fred Nile.\par \par \uc2 Even though Mr. Turnbull's Conservatives held a strong lower-house majority in the last Parliament, a hodgepodge of smaller parties and fringe parties advocating everything from souped-up cars to looser gun laws blocked legislation in the Senate, including cuts to health care and welfare spending and bills cracking down on worker unions.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=wjco20160705000052"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document J000000020160926ec7500003\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw272\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4080\pichgoal600

\par\par \b \uc2 Election\uc2  2016: \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's Negatives Complicate Ties Down the Ballot\b0\par\par\uc2 By Peter Nicholas   \par \uc2 715 \uc2 words\par \uc2 5 July 2016\par \uc2 The Wall Street Journal\par \uc2 J\par A4\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  will campaign alongside \uc2 Barack Obama\uc2  in North Carolina on Tuesday in their first joint appearance of the \uc2 election\uc2  season, expecting a boost from a sitting president whose popularity is strong among the sorts of voters Democrats need to turn out in the battleground state.\par \par \uc2 Less clear is whether Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  can offer the same sort of lift for fellow Democrats in tough races of their own.\par \par \uc2 An offshoot of Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's low favorability rating is that candidates who tie themselves to her risk alienating voters they need to win, polling shows.\par \par \uc2 A Wall Street Journal/NBC News survey last month asked whether people would be more inclined to vote for a Democratic candidate who endorsed Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's presidential bid. Some 32% said they would be less likely to vote for that candidate, while only 15% said they would be more inclined. More than half said the endorsement wouldn't matter either way.\par \par \uc2 In a dozen battleground states -- including North Carolina -- voters by a 13-point margin would be less inclined to vote for candidates who endorse Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , the Journal/NBC poll showed. Among independent voters, just 4% said they would be more apt to vote for candidates who support Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , while 38% would be less inclined.\par \par \uc2 So it isn't an easy call to share a stage with the presumptive Democratic nominee in states that are up for grabs in November, analysts say. When Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  made a campaign stop in Raleigh, N.C., on June 22, neither Democratic gubernatorial candidate Roy Cooper nor Senate hopeful Deborah Ross showed up for the rally. Both cited scheduling conflicts.\par \par \uc2 Both Ms. Ross and Mr. Cooper are planning to attend the event in Charlotte with Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  and the president, who is especially popular among African-American voters. Blacks constituted about one-third of the electorate in the North Carolina Democratic primary in March.\par \par \uc2 "We have a sizable African-American population, and it's important for any Democrat running statewide that they turn out. There's no one more capable of doing that than the president," said Andrew Taylor, a political-science professor at North Carolina State University.\par \par \uc2 A \uc2 Clinton\uc2  campaign spokesman, Jesse Ferguson, said that while "every candidate has to run their own campaign," the presumptive nominee "is proud to partner with Democrats in North Carolina."\par \par \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2 , the presumptive Republican nominee, is an even riskier candidate for state and local GOP candidates to endorse, polling shows. Some 40% of voters said they would be less inclined to vote for a Republican candidate who endorsed Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , the Journal poll showed, while only 16% said they would be more likely to back the candidate. An additional 43% said the endorsement would have no impact.\par \par \uc2 Such numbers are rooted in the unusually poor public images of both party's presumptive nominees, polling experts said. Going back to 1992, no major party nominee has racked up negative ratings as high as the two 2016 candidates. As of last month, 55% had an unfavorable view of Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 ; 60%, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 "Both \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  and \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  have a similar negative impact for other candidates on the ballot," said Micah Roberts, a Republican who helped conduct the Journal/NBC survey along with Democratic pollster Fred Yang. "It's very important, and it's something both sides of the aisle are struggling with."\par \par \uc2 Improving Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's image has been a continuing project since she first arrived on the national stage in 1992.\par \par \uc2 Assessing her public image, she said last week in Chicago that she isn't happy to hear that people don't trust her. "I personally know I have work to do on this front," she said. She blamed political opponents and "conspiracy theorists" for distorting her image but conceded she understands "trust has to be earned."\par \par \uc2 Peter Hart\uc2 , a longtime Democratic polling expert, said this month's Philadelphia convention is a marquee forum for her campaign to show a side of Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  that people find more appealing.\par \par \uc2 "The campaign just has to shift gears in terms of how she's being portrayed and how she's seen," Mr. Hart said.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=wjco20160705000048"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document J000000020160922ec750000h\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw272\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4080\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2 's businesses raise the potential for conflicts of interes, but the U.S. president and vice president aren't subject to laws that apply to nearly all other federal officials.\par \par \uc2 The reason for that dates to the nation's founding, said Norman Eisen, fellow at \uc2 Brookings Institution\uc2  and the Obama administration's former ethics counsel. The "decision-making of the founding fathers was replete with what today we would call conflicts of interest," he said, noting that early presidents made decisions on agriculture policy and slavery despite owning large plantations.\par \par \uc2 "Because the president of the United States is the single most consequential decision maker on the planet, Congress has decided his hands shouldn't be tied on any issue because of conflicts of interest over any potential financial or personal gain," Mr. Eisen said.\par \par \uc2 Other executive-branch officials must recuse themselves on certain issues and divest themselves of certain investments. For example, when former Goldman Sachs Chief Executive \uc2 Henry Paulson\uc2  was appointed as Treasury secretary in 2006, he sold about $500 million worth of Goldman.\par \par \uc2 An example of an elected official who controlled and largely owned an operating concern was former New York Mayor \uc2 Michael Bloomberg\uc2 , who resigned from all management and board positions at his companies. The city's Conflicts Board required him to "have no involvement in the day-to-day operations" of \uc2 Bloomberg LP\uc2 , but it permitted him to "participate in major decisions," according to a spokesman.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=wjco20160705000047"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document J000000020160922ec750000g\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw272\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4080\pichgoal600

\par\par \b \uc2 Election\uc2  2016 --- CAPITAL JOURNAL: The Strategy Behind Picking a Vice President\b0\par\par\uc2 By Gerald F. Seib   \par \uc2 867 \uc2 words\par \uc2 5 July 2016\par \uc2 The Wall Street Journal\par \uc2 J\par A4\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 The Fourth of July weekend marked not just a national holiday but the arrival of a quadrennial spectacle: Guess the vice presidential pick.\par \par \uc2 This year, of course, we get the game times two. Because there is no incumbent president running for re-\uc2 election\uc2 , the two presumptive nominees, \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  and \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2 , must choose.\par \par \uc2 And the rest of us get to guess. Sadly, it's a losing proposition. Names are advanced and contenders called in, but it's hard to know which are serious and which the campaigns float merely so some contender and his or her supporters will be flattered by an appearance on the shortlist. Sometimes it turns out the real choices weren't on the much-discussed shortlists at all; did anybody really see \uc2 Sarah Palin\uc2  and Dan Quayle coming?\par \par \uc2 It is possible and enlightening, though, to think about what Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  and Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  might try to accomplish with their picks. So here are five possible goals they could try to achieve with the vice presidential selections they make in the next few weeks, along with some of the contenders who might help them reach those goals:\par \par \uc2 -- Play to the base. One thing a vice presidential pick can do is energize a part of the party's base that isn't entirely sold on the nominee. For Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , that would mean finding somebody who can excite the loyal, liberal followers of Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders who aren't in love with her. The obvious choice here is Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, though Labor Secretary Tom Perez also is a possibility.\par \par \uc2 For Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , his party's conservative movement is highly suspicious of him. Indiana Gov. Mike Pence would help there; he is trusted by both social and ideological conservatives and has the added bonus of long experience as a member of Congress, meeting another \uc2 Trump\uc2  desire to name someone who can navigate Washington. Former House Speaker \uc2 Newt Gingrich\uc2  also carries the twofer mix of trusted conservative with Washington pedigree.\par \par \uc2 -- Win a key state. Nominees can make a strategic choice of a running mate in hopes of using the pick to lock up a swing state that could go either way. For Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , that might suggest North Carolina Sen. Richard Burr. North Carolina went Democratic, barely, in 2008, then swung back to the Republicans in 2012. Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  needs badly to keep it there. Mr. Burr also is chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, which would help shore up Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's credentials on national security.\par \par \uc2 Another possibility in this category would be \uc2 Gov. Chris Christie\uc2  of New Jersey, a state Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  has said he'd love to win back from the Democrats. That seems like a long shot, though, and Mr. Christie's popularity is sagging at home.\par \par \uc2 For Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , there are few states more important than Ohio, and there a reliable liberal ally, Sen. Sherrod Brown, could be an attractive strategic pick.\par \par \uc2 -- Hit a key demographic. Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  needs help with women. Sen. Joni Ernst of Iowa, whom Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  was to meet Monday, could provide that; she also happens to represent a swing state. Oklahoma Gov. Mary Fallin could also punch this ticket.\par \par \uc2 Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  would like to lock up a big Hispanic vote, which means Housing Secretary Juli\u225\'00\'E1n Castro or his twin brother, Rep. Joaqu\u237\'00\'EDn Castro, rising stars in her party, could be appealing. Ditto for Rep. Xavier Becerra, chairman of the House Democratic Caucus. A choice of New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker, meanwhile, would send a powerful signal to African-American Democrats that their standing in the party won't diminish in the post-Barack Obama era.\par \par \uc2 -- Shake things up. Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  probably doesn't need any help in this category. He has shaken things up plenty all by himself.\par \par \uc2 Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , though, might want to show that she is thinking outside the political establishment box in which many put her, and appeal directly to moderates and business leaders put off by Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's style and populist positions. That's why some are speculating that Howard Schultz, chairman and chief executive of Starbucks, might be under consideration.\par \par \uc2 -- Play it safe. One approach is to eschew all these tactical goals and simply pick someone the nominee is comfortable with -- and whose credentials as a potential president are solid, whether they excite the electorate in some other way or not.\par \par \uc2 For Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , that might suggest Sen. Jeff Sessions. He's a 10-year Senate veteran, a former U.S. attorney, a reliable conservative -- and, perhaps as important, an early \uc2 Trump\uc2  supporter. His home state of Alabama is reliably red, so Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  doesn't need his help there. But he checks the knows-Washington box.\par \par \uc2 For Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , the similarly comfortable choice might be Tim Kaine or his fellow Virginia senator, Mark Warner. They may be too moderate to please some in the party's liberal wing -- and Mr. Kaine has a complicated record on abortion rights -- but they would be reassuring to independent voters, and also represent a key swing state.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=wjco20160705000046"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document J000000020160922ec750000f\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw272\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4080\pichgoal600

\par\par \b \uc2 Trump\uc2  Business Reach Stirs Conflict Questions\b0\par\par\uc2 By Monica Langley   \par \uc2 1,094 \uc2 words\par \uc2 5 July 2016\par \uc2 The Wall Street Journal\par \uc2 J\par A1\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 NEW YORK -- Back in his 26th-floor office after a recent campaign swing, Republican presidential candidate \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  sat down at his desk and began signing a two-inch stack of checks, including ones for $10,000 for fuel, $21,000 for concrete and $99,000 to a contractor at a hotel construction site.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  personally oversees many of his routine business expenses this way. Yet he also says he would separate himself from that business empire, and the many potential conflicts of interest it might create, by putting his ownership into a blind trust, most likely with his adult children as its trustees, if he were elected president.\par \par \uc2 "I wouldn't mind a blind trust," he said in a recent interview. "I would be doing one thing. My total focus would be on making this country great again. I wouldn't even think about the company."\par \par \uc2 With Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  heading into the general \uc2 election\uc2 , the conflicts-of-interest question looms both large and complex. That is because the \uc2 Trump\uc2  Organization\uc2 , which is owned solely by him, consists mostly of operating assets, as opposed to passive investments. Hundreds of business entities, including some in foreign countries, own or manage hotels, commercial and residential real estate, golf resorts and even part of the reality TV show "The Apprentice."\par \par \uc2 "\uc2 Trump\uc2 's empire would pose unprecedented conflicts of interest due to the size of its holdings, privately held nature of the family-run business, and concentration in one industry," said Richard Painter, University of Minnesota law professor who was the White House's chief ethics lawyer for President George W. Bush.\par \par \uc2 "A blind trust would never work in \uc2 Trump\uc2 's case, because his assets are known, not blind, and children aren't independent trustees," he added, noting that other modern-era wealthy presidents, such as Franklin D. Roosevelt and John F. Kennedy, were "old-money with diversified holdings" that didn't directly manage businesses.\par \par \uc2 No federal law would require Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  to remove himself from running his empire, ethics experts say. But Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , who has financed some of his real estate with debt and expanded his organization globally, would be closely scrutinized for any policy stance that would affect banking, real estate or the foreign countries where his properties can be found.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  said his business dealings wouldn't influence how he would approach the banking or real-estate sectors or foreign policy. He also said he would let other executives run the trust if his children would be considered too close to him to serve as trustees.\par \par \uc2 "I'll do whatever I have to do," the New York billionaire said.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  and a small coterie of executives and three of his adult children -- Donald Jr., Ivanka and Eric -- maintain a tight grip on all major assets, which are kept on a three-page list. Even though Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  controls outgoing expenditures, he has transferred most of the day-to-day management of the empire's strategy and operations to his children.\par \par \uc2 He seems unable, however, to stop himself from meddling in operations. When Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  recently stopped by the Old Post Office site in Washington, D.C., which he is renovating into a luxury hotel, he inspected the finishes on wall moldings and queried the hotel manager on the size of a reception area. "Is it too late to change it now?"\par \par \uc2 Ivanka \uc2 Trump\uc2  oversaw the $350 million acquisition and renovation of \uc2 Trump\uc2  National Doral, the 800-acre Miami hotel and spa, while her brother Eric supervised improvements to indoor and outdoor public spaces throughout its golf resort.\par \par \uc2 Donald Jr., who runs most of the company's commercial leasing, has pushed rents higher and occupancy to 97% at the commercial office building 40 Wall Street in a "re-set" with new leases on 750,000 square feet of the building, according to a \uc2 Trump\uc2  executive.\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 Trump\uc2  empire makes money on real estate it doesn't own. \uc2 Trump\uc2  International Hotel and Tower in Vancouver, set to open in August, is expected to provide a sizable annual revenue stream from management and licensing fees.\par \par \uc2 As Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  continued signing his stack of checks, which he occasionally does on his private jet when on the campaign trail, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  added: "Signing checks is just one way . . . to know what's really going on . . . I sign my own checks as much as possible."\par \par \uc2 The potential for conflicts abounds. In his campaign financial statement, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  disclosed loans and personal guarantees ranging from $315 million to $500 million from a total of 10 creditors. "The loans are a tiny proportion of my net worth," he said.\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 Trump\uc2  Organization\uc2  has five licensing deals for mixed-use luxury properties in India and other hotel, residential and development projects around the globe, \uc2 Ivanka \uc2 Trump\uc2  said. Foreign interests provide revenue from management and licensing fees because Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  doesn't have ownership stakes, with the exception of \uc2 Trump\uc2  properties in the U.K., which are wholly owned, she said.\par \par \uc2 Democrats have said Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's conflicts of interest are already on display in his public comments. He questioned the integrity of a federal judge handling a civil case against his now-defunct \uc2 Trump\uc2  University, based on the judge's ethnicity, and he cited an \uc2 Internal Revenue Service\uc2  audit of his taxes as a reason he won't release his tax returns. Last month, he commented on the U.K. vote to leave the \uc2 European Union\uc2  while in Scotland promoting a newly renovated golf resort.\par \par \uc2 Significant conflicts of interest also arise over presumptive Democratic nominee \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  and her ties with the \uc2 Clinton\uc2  Foundation\uc2 , ethics experts say.\par \par \uc2 "\uc2 Clinton\uc2 's conflict also would be unprecedented with the scale and breadth of her family foundation, because it has been receiving substantial gifts from private parties, including some from outside the United States," said Mr. Painter, of the \uc2 University of Minnesota\uc2 . He suggests both candidates separate themselves and their family members from their organizations.\par \par \uc2 Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  "stepped down from the foundation just prior to launching her campaign last year," a spokesman said. Former President \uc2 Bill \uc2 Clinton\uc2  has said the foundation's work and structure would change if his wife were elected president.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  dismissed the idea of the need for a complete undoing of his family business. "It's almost like there is no conflict," the businessman said. "The better I do as president, the better it is for my business -- and everybody's business."\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=wjco20160705000037"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document J000000020160922ec7500006\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 National Desk; SECTA\par \b \uc2 Trump\uc2  Finds Himself Playing Catch-Up in Ohio, a Bellwether State for the G.O.P.\b0\par\par\uc2 By TRIP GABRIEL \par \uc2 1,163 \uc2 words\par \uc2 5 July 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 15\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 COLUMBUS, Ohio -- Since the Republican Party's 19th-century founding, not one of its nominees has won the White House without carrying Ohio, a most diverse and perennially hard-fought state.\par \par \uc2 But as Republicans head to Cleveland to nominate \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2  in two weeks, a convention city chosen with Battleground Ohio much in mind, a vortex of headwinds are rising against Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  in the state.\par \par \uc2 The barely concealed disdain of Gov. John R. Kasich, a former rival who has not endorsed the presumptive nominee, echoes through the state's Republican leadership, whose full engagement in the fall campaign will be needed to turn out voters.\par \par \uc2 Images of disunity in Cleveland, where delegates are gathering July 18-21 in the shadow of local polls showing a majority of Republicans prefer a different nominee, could make it harder for the party to attract grass-roots activists for the fall campaign.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  ignored Ohio for six weeks after clinching the nomination, until a visit last week to coal country, where he spoke to an audience of largely white working-class voters, including some Democrats. It was the group he has performed best with in primaries and polls.\par \par \uc2 But in describing a trade deal during the same visit as a ''rape of our country,'' his oratory and protectionist policies are turning off other Republican-leaning voters, including suburban women and business interests, in a state whose economy depends on global exports.\par \par \uc2 ''If you look at the primary and extrapolate, \uc2 Trump\uc2  could get two-thirds of the white working class,'' said John C. Green, a political scientist at the University of Akron. That would improve on \uc2 Mitt Romney\uc2 's share of these voters in Ohio in 2012, when the state slipped from his grasp by only 103,000 votes.\par \par \uc2 ''The flip side is \uc2 Trump\uc2 's appeal to white working-class men very well may cost him other kinds of Republican voters,'' Mr. Green said.\par \par \uc2 Public polling of Ohio, which has been scant, shows \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  with an average lead of about three percentage points.\par \par \uc2 Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  and her supporters are already spending heavily in the state on ads to define Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  negatively, and last week Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  visited Cincinnati with Senator Elizabeth Warren, who electrified the crowd by mocking Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  for running a campaign no deeper than the slogans on his ''goofy'' hats.\par \par \uc2 A recent \uc2 Quinnipiac\uc2  Poll of Ohio, showing the race deadlocked, indicated women were moving toward Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  while Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's strength among men was unchanged.\par \par \uc2 Bob Seszko, a school bus mechanic from rural Blair, Ohio, said he voted for Senator Bernie Sanders in the Democratic primary but planned to vote for Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  in November. In the 1980s, he had made good money at a steel plant in the Ohio River Valley -- until it closed.\par \par \uc2 ''Overseas was selling it cheaper than we could make it, so I lost my job,'' he said. ''I think \uc2 Trump\uc2 's more sincere than Hillary is. She's riding on the coattails of her husband.''\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's appeal to such voters is likely to be strong, especially in the industrial region around Youngstown and Akron.\par \par \uc2 That he has kept the race tight even after weeks of negative news -- about his visit to Scotland, his firing of his campaign manager and his congratulating himself after the nightclub shooting in Orlando, Fla. -- is a testament to the strength of Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's appeal with his base, as well as the polarization of the electorate.\par \par \uc2 To counter the threat, Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  and her supporters began a barrage of general-\uc2 election\uc2  television ads in Ohio and other swing states in May, and for the Fourth of July weekend, they planned a $13 million blitz mostly in Ohio and Florida.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , who is skeptical of TV ads and short on campaign cash, has not bought any general \uc2 election\uc2  ads in the state. The first ad supporting him from an outside group, the \uc2 National Rifle Association\uc2 , featuring a survivor of the terrorist attacks in Benghazi, Libya, was just rolled out.\par \par \uc2 ''I've gotten to the point where I feel so much of this is on the \uc2 Trump\uc2  campaign,'' said Matt Borges, chairman of the Ohio Republican Party.\par \par \uc2 He said Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  recently called him after reading that Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  was far ahead in hiring field staff members in Ohio.\par \par \uc2 In March, Mr. Borges and other Republican leaders in the state bluntly warned that if Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  were the nominee, he could not carry their perennially close-fought state.\par \par \uc2 ''We want to distance ourselves from the kind of rhetoric that \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  is using to divide Americans,'' Mr. Borges said at the time. ''If \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  is unfortunately our choice and our nominee, it could imperil not only the race for the White House but many other candidates down-ticket.''\par \par \uc2 The state's Republican leaders, who supported their native son Mr. Kasich before his withdrawal from the race, no longer openly scorn Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 . But they pick their words carefully, withholding full support.\par \par \uc2 ''A great many people in Ohio are watching Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  closely to see if over the weeks and months he will emerge as an individual of presidential stature,'' said Brad Sinnott, chairman of the Republican Central Committee of Franklin County, which includes Columbus, the capital. ''There is some work to be done.''\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , who has signaled a strategy of outsourcing grass-roots organizing to the national party, hired a state director only late last month. The \uc2 Republican National Committee\uc2 , which promised last year to hire more than 200 field staff members in the state, has about 50 now, and has yet to open its first Ohio office.\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 Clinton\uc2  campaign, which declined to say how many staff members it has in Ohio, is also coordinating with state and national Democrats, who collectively have more than 100 people in the field, said \uc2 Kirstin Alvanitakis\uc2 , a state party spokeswoman. The \uc2 Clinton\uc2  campaign plans to open offices across the state in the coming weeks.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's appeal helped drive record turnout in the primary in March. ''I told him we had a million new Republicans,'' Mr. Borges recalled of a conversation he had with Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 . ''He asked, 'Is that because of me?'''\par \par \uc2 ''I told him yes,'' he said.\par \par \uc2 What he did not say is that many Republican primary voters came out to vote against Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , who received nearly 36 percent of the vote in the contest, which Mr. Kasich won.\par \par \uc2 ''You don't have a stop-\uc2 Trump\uc2  movement without \uc2 Trump\uc2 ,'' Mr. Borges said.\par \par \uc2 Find out what you need to know about the 2016 presidential race today, and get politics news updates via \uc2 Facebook\uc2 , \uc2 Twitter\uc2  and the First Draft newsletter.\par \par \uc2 Supporters waited in line to attend a rally for Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2  last week in St. Clairsville, Ohio.

\par\par \uc2 Politics; SECT\par \b \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2 's Potential Running Mates: Pros and Cons\b0\par\par\uc2 By ASHLEY PARKER \par \uc2 816 \uc2 words\par \uc2 5 July 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 The New York Times on the Web\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2  plans to announce his running mate before the Republican National Convention in Cleveland this month, and has started an ''Apprentice''-style search -- meeting with possible candidates one by one and then posting on \uc2 Twitter\uc2  about it. (On Monday, he even praised on Twitter Senator Tom Cotton of Arkansas, a long-shot running mate whom some Republicans nonetheless like because of his military service.)\par \par \uc2 Below is a look at the four potential candidates for vice president whom the \uc2 Trump\uc2  campaign has already begun vetting:\par \par \uc2 Gov. Chris Christie\uc2  of New Jersey\par \par \uc2 Why Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  would choose him: After dropping out of the Republican primary contest, Mr. Christie was one of Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's earliest endorsers -- the sort of loyalty that goes far in his world. Mr. Christie has since emerged as a key figure behind the scenes, including running Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's transition team.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  has said he would like to choose someone with government experience, and Mr. Christie's leadership of a traditionally Democratic state, where he has pushed legislation through the New Jersey State House, could help in working with a deeply divided Congress. Mr. Christie himself is also brash enough to handle the outsize personality at the top of the ticket.\par \par \uc2 Possible downside: Mr. Christie is still dealing with fallout from the George Washington Bridge lane-closing scandal. Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  has also seemed dismissive of Mr. Christie at times on the campaign trail, once ordering him back to the plane after the governor had finished introducing the Manhattan businessman.\par \par \uc2 And \uc2 Jared Kushner\uc2 , Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's son-in-law, who wields an increasingly influential role behind the scenes on the campaign team, has a fraught relationship with Mr. Christie, who as a prosecutor helped send his father to jail.\par \par \uc2 _____\par \par \uc2 Senator Joni Ernst of Iowa\par \par \uc2 Why Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  would choose her: A Harley-riding mom from a socially conservative state, Ms. Ernst electrified the Republican establishment with her \uc2 election\uc2  to the Senate in 2014, and quickly emerged as one of the party's rising stars and fresh faces. During her Senate bid, she garnered attention with an ad about pig castration and her promise to make the politicians in Washington ''squeal'' -- an outsider ethos that matches that of Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 She is an Iraq war veteran and retired National Guard lieutenant colonel, which could bring military and foreign policy experience -- two areas in which Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  is lacking. And as a woman, she could help him shore up his standing with female voters among whom Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  trails far behind \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  in polls.\par \par \uc2 Possible downside: Elected to the Senate just two years ago, Ms. Ernst lacks a deep breadth of national governing experience. She was a disciplined if carefully managed candidate during her Senate bid, and it is unclear if she can withstand not just the media scrutiny of being the vice presidential pick, but also the general chaos of the \uc2 Trump\uc2  operation.\par \par \uc2 _____\par \par \uc2 Newt Gingrich\uc2 , former House speaker\par \par \uc2 Why Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  would choose him: A former speaker of the House and Republican congressman from Georgia for two decades, Mr. Gingrich brings the governing experience and Washington know-how that Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  says he wants in a running mate. Mr. Gingrich also seems eager for the job, and has the intellectual bona fides and dynamic personality to handle someone like Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  as his running mate.\par \par \uc2 Possible downside: Mr. Gingrich was perhaps the most public face of partisan warfare with the Clintons during the 1990s, and was ultimately forced to resign his speakership after an ethics violation and poor showing from Republicans in the 1998 midterm elections. He is also a thrice-married convert to Catholicism.\par \par \uc2 _____\par \par \uc2 Gov. Mike Pence\uc2  of Indiana\par \par \uc2 Why \uc2 Trump\uc2  would choose him: Mr. Pence, the popular governor of a Rust Belt swing state -- President Obama narrowly won Indiana in 2008; \uc2 Mitt Romney\uc2 , the Republican candidate, won it 2012 -- is a favorite among social conservatives, and could help reassure a Republican base still skeptical about Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's credentials.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Pence has twice toyed with a presidential run, and is locked in a close re-\uc2 election\uc2  fight with John Gregg, a Democrat and former speaker of Indiana's House of Representatives, making a place on Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's ticket potentially more appealing.\par \par \uc2 Possible downside: Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  talks of expanding the electoral map and attracting a broad coalition to beat Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , including some disaffected Democrats, link those who originally supported Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont. But Mr. Pence's socially conservative stances, especially on gay rights, could turn off some of those voters. He also endorsed Senator Ted Cruz of Texas in the Republican primary, but failed to deliver his home state.\par \par \uc2 Find out what you need to know about the 2016 presidential race today, and get politics news updates via \uc2 Facebook\uc2 , \uc2 Twitter\uc2  and the First Draft newsletter.\par \par \uc2 Document NYTF000020160705ec750005p\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

His Main Allure: His Style (to Be Blunt).\b0\par\par\uc2 By JAMES GLANZ; Myra Noveck contributed reporting. \par \uc2 1,358 \uc2 words\par \uc2 5 July 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 8\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 JERUSALEM -- \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2  has been called a lot of things by a lot of people around the world. In Israel, where his comments about remaining ''neutral'' in peace negotiations raised hackles but his condemnation of ''radical Islam'' wins plaudits, the word that keeps coming up is ''dugri.''\par \par \uc2 A slang Hebrew term derived from the Arabic for ''straight ahead,'' dugri describes someone who is frank and blunt no matter the consequences. This is how many outsiders view Israelis, often with considerable discomfort. But here in Israel, a society that views pretension with suspicion and disdain, it is almost universally a compliment.\par \par \uc2 ''Israelis tend to talk more frankly and openly about subjects that, in America, could be somewhat taboo,'' said Zev Chafets, a co-host of a weekly radio program in Tel Aviv that focuses on the United States' \uc2 election\uc2 . ''\uc2 Trump\uc2  does that. People find that refreshing.''\par \par \uc2 American presidential elections are not, of course, won or lost in Israel, but candidates nevertheless treat it almost as a state with electoral votes, wooing the public with promises and calculated charm. This year, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, and his Democratic counterpart, \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , have promised to outdo each other in protecting Israel's security.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  has also repeatedly pointed out that his daughter Ivanka converted to Judaism before marrying \uc2 Jared Kushner\uc2 ; Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's daughter, Chelsea, is also married to a Jew, Marc Mezvinsky.\par \par \uc2 Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  offers deep experience in the region from her years as secretary of state, and benefits from the fact that her husband, former President \uc2 Bill \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , is a beloved figure among Israeli Jews. Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's hard line on terrorism has earned applause from Israeli Jews, although the Israeli military's dependence on billions of dollars from Washington has led many to worry about his promise to revisit all foreign-aid arrangements.\par \par \uc2 There are about 200,000 eligible American voters in Israel; in 2012, about 75,000 requested absentee ballots. In past elections, having the Israeli public and political class in one's camp was seen as an asset for candidates from both parties, if only because of how it translated with influential pro-Israel activists and other Jewish leaders back home.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  has had less interaction with Israel than Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  -- he canceled a planned trip here last fall amid the controversy over his proposal to temporarily bar Muslims from entering the United States -- and to American Jewish groups.\par \par \uc2 Mitchell Barak, an American-Israeli political consultant in Jerusalem, conducted a poll in February and found that Israelis overwhelmingly supported the Muslim ban, but that they would also prefer to see Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  as president.\par \par \uc2 Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's decades of public service, Mr. Barak said, are admired in a nation that deeply values experience in its politicians. ''Gray hair is an advantage here,'' he said.\par \par \uc2 Though much of that service was in the cabinet of President Obama, who is deeply distrusted across Israel, she managed to steer clear of the controversy surrounding her boss. Some analysts say that relationship is largely overshadowed by her marriage to Mr. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , who was always seen as a genuine friend of Israel, despite the failure of repeated rounds of peace talks he oversaw.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's parting words at the memorial for Yitzhak Rabin, the prime minister assassinated in 1995 by a Jewish extremist, still raise goose bumps: ''Shalom, chaver.'' Goodbye, friend.\par \par \uc2 ''Just like \uc2 Clinton\uc2  was the first black president,'' Mr. Chafets quipped, ''he was the first Jewish president.''\par \par \uc2 Still, Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  has so far stirred little real enthusiasm in Israel, possibly opening the door for Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  and his dugri style.\par \par \uc2 ''It does concern me because that sort of bluff, gruff, tough-guy approach is admired here,'' said Sheldon Schorer, an official with the Israel branch of Democrats Abroad.\par \par \uc2 Dugri may derive from driving directions in Arabic, but it has become much more. In the late 1990s, the Palestinian leader, Yasir Arafat, was said to have described Ehud Barak, the Israeli prime minister with whom he was trying to make peace, as ''dugri, dugri.''\par \par \uc2 ''Daber iti dugri'' is the rough equivalent in Hebrew of ''Give it to me straight.'' Being dugri, long prized for its own sake, has taken on even more value at a time when many Israelis criticize the unwillingness of Mr. Obama and other Democrats to use the term ''radical Islam.''\par \par \uc2 ''There's a natural affinity for his rebellion against political correctness,'' Dahlia Scheindlin, a public-opinion expert in Tel Aviv, said of Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , ''because Israelis have embraced that rebellion for years.''\par \par \uc2 Mr. Schorer, the Democratic activist, said that beneath the growl, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's inexperience and impetuousness could be troublesome to Israelis. Over the weekend, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  came under fire in the United States for his use on \uc2 Twitter\uc2  of an image that many observers said included anti-Semitic stereotypes in an attack on Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  for being ''corrupt.''\par \par \uc2 In Israel, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  first raised alarms when he said during a Republican presidential primary debate in February that he would remain ''neutral'' in negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians. He later modified that by saying he would portray himself as neutral to the Palestinians while really taking Israel's side.\par \par \uc2 More recently, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  has generated headlines in Israel by declaring that the United States should emulate some of Israel's security practices. He has said a version of the security barrier Israel built along and through the occupied West Bank should be erected along the border with Mexico, and he asserted that the United States should follow what he called Israel's ''profiling'' of Muslims at security checkpoints.\par \par \uc2 His compliments were not universally welcomed. A columnist for the left-leaning newspaper Haaretz, Chemi Shalev, worried that Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's admiration of Israel could weaken Democratic support in the United States for Israel's security policies. ''His compliments damn Israel with loud praise,'' Mr. Shalev wrote.\par \par \uc2 Pressed by reporters after Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's ''profiling'' comment, a senior Israeli minister refused to discuss American politics but defended profiling as effective in limited circumstances, according to Reuters. ''Sometimes, when there is a specific form of terrorism, you can seek out Islamic terrorism only among Muslims,'' said the minister, Yisrael Katz.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's praise of Israeli policies alone is not likely to lift his appeal to Israelis, said Shmuel Sandler of the \uc2 Begin-Sadat Center for Strategic Studies\uc2  at Bar-Ilan University. ''We always enjoy the fact that the West is coming to learn from us,'' Mr. Sandler said. ''More than this, I don't think it will make a difference.''\par \par \uc2 Israelis view relations with the United States as a paramount priority, and often judge their own politicians partly on how they do in Washington.\par \par \uc2 A poll in May by the Israel Democracy Institute, a Jerusalem research organization, found Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  with a 10-point lead on the question of which candidate would be ''better from the standpoint of Israel's interests.''\par \par \uc2 Mitchell Barak's poll, commissioned by the \uc2 Konrad Adenauer Foundation\uc2  in Germany and undertaken in Hebrew, Arabic and Russian, found that only the Russian group favored Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 . Over all, respondents preferred Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  over Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  by a ratio of more than two to one, though the largest number of those surveyed were undecided or picked other candidates who were still in the race at the time.\par \par \uc2 ''They like strong leaders,'' Mr. Barak said, adding that Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  ''tells it like it is.'' Dugri, again.\par \par \uc2 But Yohanan Plesner, the president of the Israel Democracy Institute, said that conflicting statements by Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  and his advisers on levels of foreign aid to Israel had largely sown confusion in the minds of Israelis.\par \par \uc2 ''First of all, the Israeli public is quite confused,'' Mr. Plesner said. ''The jury's out, and people are flip-flopping and changing their mind.''\par \par \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2  at a campaign event in Dallas last month. He has praised Israel's security practices.

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 SINCE \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  assures us that the Bible is his favorite book, it's worth asking: Just what is his theology?\par \par \uc2 After Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  met with hundreds of evangelical Christians a couple of weeks ago, \uc2 James Dobson\uc2 , who is among the most influential leaders in the evangelical world and serves on Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's evangelical executive advisory board, declared that ''\uc2 Trump\uc2  appears to be tender to things of the Spirit,'' by which Dr. Dobson meant the Holy Spirit.\par \par \uc2 Of all the descriptions of Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  we've heard this \uc2 election\uc2  season, this may be the most farcical. As described by St. Paul, the ''fruit of the Spirit'' includes forbearance, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness and self-control, hardly qualities one associates with Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 . It shows you the lengths Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's supporters will go to in order to rationalize their enthusiastic support of him.\par \par \uc2 Dr. Dobson is not alone. \uc2 Jerry Falwell Jr\uc2 ., the president of Liberty University, has praised Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's life as in many ways exemplary and said that he believes that ''\uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  is God's man to lead our nation.'' Eric Metaxas, who has written popular biographies of William Wilberforce and Dietrich Bonhoeffer, has rhapsodized about Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  and argued that Christians ''must'' vote for him because he is ''the last best hope of keeping America from sliding into oblivion.''\par \par \uc2 And should your conscience tell you that Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  might not be the right choice, Robert Jeffress, the influential pastor of First Baptist Church in Dallas, explains that ''any Christian who would sit at home and not vote for the Republican nominee'' is ''motivated by pride rather than principle.''\par \par \uc2 This fulsome embrace of Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  is rather problematic, since he embodies a worldview that is incompatible with Christianity. If you trace that worldview to its source, Christ would not be anywhere in the vicinity.\par \par \uc2 Time and again Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  has shown contempt for those he perceives as weak and vulnerable -- ''losers,'' in his vernacular. They include P.O.W.s, people with disabilities, those he deems physically unattractive and those he considers politically powerless. He bullies and threatens people he believes are obstacles to his ambitions. He disdains compassion and empathy, to the point where his instinctive response to the largest mass shooting in American history was to congratulate himself: ''Appreciate the congrats for being right.''\par \par \uc2 What Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  admires is strength. For him, a person's intrinsic worth is tied to worldly success and above all to power. He never seems free of his obsession with it. In his comments to that gathering of evangelicals, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  said this: ''And I say to you folks, because you have such power, such influence. Unfortunately the government has weeded it away from you pretty strongly. But you're going to get it back. Remember this: If you ever add up, the men and women here are the most important, powerful lobbyists. You're more powerful. Because you have men and women, you probably have something like 75, 80 percent of the country believing. But you don't use your power. You don't use your power.''\par \par \uc2 In eight sentences Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  mentioned some variation of power six times, to a group of individuals who have professed their love and loyalty to Jesus, who in his most famous sermon declared, ''Blessed are the poor in spirit'' and ''Blessed are the meek,'' who said, ''My strength is made perfect in weakness,'' and who was humiliated and crucified by the powerful.\par \par \uc2 To better understand Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's approach to life, ethics and politics, we should not look to Christ but to Friedrich Nietzsche, who was repulsed by Christianity and Christ. ''What is good?'' Nietzsche asks in ''The Anti-Christ'': ''Whatever augments the feeling of power, the will to power, power itself in man. What is evil? Whatever springs from weakness. What is happiness? The feeling that power increases -- that resistance is overcome.''\par \par \uc2 Whether or not he has read a word of Nietzsche (I'm guessing not), Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  embodies a Nietzschean morality rather than a Christian one. It is characterized by indifference to objective truth (there are no facts, only interpretations), the repudiation of Christian concern for the poor and the weak, and disdain for the powerless. It celebrates the ''\u220\'00\'DCbermensch,'' or Superman, who rejects Christian morality in favor of his own. For Nietzsche, strength was intrinsically good and weakness was intrinsically bad. So, too, for \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Those who believe this is merely reductionism should consider the words of Jesus: Do you have eyes but fail to see and ears but fail to hear? Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's entire approach to politics rests on dehumanization. If you disagree with him or oppose him, you are not merely wrong. You are worthless, stripped of dignity, the object of derision. This attitude is central to who Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  is and explains why it pervades and guides his campaign. If he is elected president, that might-makes-right perspective would infect his entire administration.\par \par \uc2 All of this is important because of what it says about Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  as a prospective president. But it is also revealing for what it says about Christians who now testify on his behalf (there are plenty who don't). The calling of Christians is to be ''salt and light'' to the world, to model a philosophy that defends human dignity, and to welcome the stranger in our midst. It is to stand for justice, dispense grace and be agents of reconciliation in a broken world. And it is to take seriously the words of the prophet Micah, ''And what does the Lord require of you but to do justly, and to love kindness and mercy, and to humble yourself and walk humbly with your God?''\par \par \uc2 Evangelical Christians who are enthusiastically supporting \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  are signaling, even if unintentionally, that this calling has no place in politics and that Christians bring nothing distinctive to it -- that their past moral proclamations were all for show and that power is the name of the game.\par \par \uc2 The French philosopher and theologian Jacques Ellul wrote: ''Politics is the church's worst problem. It is her constant temptation, the occasion of her greatest disasters, the trap continually set for her by the prince of this world.'' In rallying round Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , evangelicals have walked into the trap. The rest of the world sees it. Why don't they?\par \par \uc2 Follow The \uc2 New York Times\uc2  Opinion section on \uc2 Facebook\uc2  and \uc2 Twitter\uc2  (@NYTOpinion), and sign up for the Opinion Today newsletter.\par \par \uc2 Peter Wehner, a senior fellow at the Ethics and Public Policy Center, served in the last three Republican administrations and is a contributing opinion writer.\par \par \uc2 DRAWING (DRAWING BY CHRISTIAN NORTHEAST) \par \par \uc2 Document NYTF000020160705ec750005w\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 Business/Financial Desk; SECTB\par \b \uc2 A Rush for Books on \uc2 Trump\b0\par\par\uc2 By ALEXANDRA ALTER \par \uc2 1,342 \uc2 words\par \uc2 5 July 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 1\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 On his bedroom wall, the New Yorker writer Mark Singer has a framed, handwritten note from \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2 . ''Mark, you are a total loser! And your book (and writings) sucks!'' the note says.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  sent it after Mr. Singer published ''Character Studies,'' a 2005 collection of his writing that included a less than flattering profile of Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Mr. Singer loved the letter so much that he not only framed it, but also decided to make it the sole blurb on the back cover of his new book, ''\uc2 Trump\uc2  and Me,'' which will be published on July 5. The book includes the original New Yorker profile, published in 1997, as well as Mr. Singer's dryly funny account of the real estate tycoon's response and a more sober chapter reflecting on Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  the candidate.\par \par \uc2 ''People remembered this piece, for better or worse, and I did want to find a way to bring it back to life,'' Mr. Singer said. ''The challenge was to reconcile this person that I observed in the late '90s with this iteration of him in the \uc2 election\uc2 .''\par \par \uc2 Every \uc2 election\uc2  cycle brings a tsunami of political books from campaign reporters, pundits and candidates. (Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's own manifesto, ''Crippled America: How to Make America Great Again,'' has sold 235,000 hardcover copies in eight months, according to Nielsen.)\par \par \uc2 But this year is shaping up to be an exceptional one in terms of the sheer volume of writing devoted to Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 . Some publishers and writers are exhuming out-of-print \uc2 Trump\uc2  biographies published decades ago and slapping new covers and introductions on them. Others are rushing out new books that explore Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's stunning political rise.\par \par \uc2 Still others are producing parodies, comic books and satires, including a faux thriller titled ''The Day of the Donald,'' which takes place two years into a \uc2 Trump\uc2  presidency. There is also a mock children's book by the comedian Michael Ian Black titled ''A Child's First Book of \uc2 Trump\uc2 ,'' and a collection from the cartoonist Garry Trudeau called ''Yuge!: 30 Years of Doonesbury on \uc2 Trump\uc2 .'' (And in a sign that no publishing niche has been left unexploited, there are more than a half-dozen \uc2 Trump\uc2 -themed adult coloring books. Also, a book of \uc2 Trump\uc2  paper dolls.)\par \par \uc2 Even \uc2 Corey Lewandowski\uc2 , Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's former campaign manager, was at one point shopping a book about the inner workings of the \uc2 Trump\uc2  campaign, and had an offer to publish the book with HarperCollins. But the agreement faltered in May when Mr. Lewandowski backed away from the deal, after \uc2 BuzzFeed\uc2  reported that he was working on a book. (Mr. Lewandowski, who did not respond to a request for comment, has denied that he was working on a book.)\par \par \uc2 Last month, Mr. Lewandowski sought to restore the deal, worth a reported $1.2 million, after he was fired from the \uc2 Trump\uc2  campaign, \uc2 Politico\uc2  recently reported. But HarperCollins declined to renew the offer, according to a publishing executive familiar with the talks.\par \par \uc2 Like political pundits, publishers are sometimes bad prognosticators. Many editors were hesitant to commission books about Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  when he first entered the race and seemed like a long shot for the nomination. Once he became the presumptive nominee in May, agents, editors and writers were scrambling to pull together books in time for the \uc2 election\uc2  -- a lightning-fast turnaround time in the publishing world.\par \par \uc2 Fortunately for them, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  has provided plenty of dramatic new material. With his bombastic swagger, changing policy positions and larger-than-life persona, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  has proved to be an irresistible subject for writers and political satirists.\par \par \uc2 This summer, as the race between Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  and \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  accelerates, publishers are releasing a flurry of books that dissect Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's short and eventful presidential run. In August, Melville House plans to release ''The Making of \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2 ,'' by the Pulitzer Prize-winning investigative reporter David Cay Johnston, which chronicles Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's rise in real estate and his pivot to politics, and draws on decades of interviews, court documents and financial records.\par \par \uc2 Later that month, Scribner is set to publish ''\uc2 Trump\uc2  Revealed,'' a biography written by the Washington Post editor Marc Fisher and a Post investigative political reporter, Michael Kranish. It will draw on the work of more than two dozen Post reporters and researchers.\par \par \uc2 These new books will bump up against the repackaged editions of older \uc2 Trump\uc2  biographies that have taken on new significance now that Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  is a presidential candidate running on his business record.\par \par \uc2 Timothy O'Brien, whose 2005 book ''TrumpNation: The Art of Being the Donald,'' prompted a $5 billion, ultimately unsuccessful, defamation lawsuit from Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , contacted his publisher last summer after Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  announced his candidacy to ask if they could update the paperback and digital editions of his book. His publisher was skeptical at first.\par \par \uc2 ''We thought, he's going to implode, there's no point,'' said \uc2 Jamie Raab\uc2 , the president and publisher of Grand Central Publishing.\par \par \uc2 Eight months later, when Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  swept a series of primaries, Grand Central agreed to republish the book as a paperback with a new introduction by Mr. O'Brien. The updated version includes new details about Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's finances that were disclosed during his lawsuit against Mr. O'Brien and the publisher. Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  alleged that Mr. O'Brien had libeled him by undervaluing his net worth and damaged his reputation as a businessman. In the deposition, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  said his net worth could fluctuate with his feelings.\par \par \uc2 ''The deposition has become one of the Rosetta stones of the 2016 campaigns, because you had a trio of fantastic lawyers holding his feet to the fire about his business dealings,'' said Mr. O'Brien, a former editor for The New York Times. ''They sort of stripped the bark off \uc2 Trump\uc2  like an old tree.''\par \par \uc2 Still, not every publisher has an appetite for taking on \uc2 Trump\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Harry Hurt III had hoped to republish his out-of-print unauthorized \uc2 Trump\uc2  biography, ''Lost Tycoon: The Many Lives of \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2 ,'' with his original publisher, W.W. Norton, this year. The book, an explosive expos\u233\'00\'E9 of Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's personal life and financial travails, caused a minor scandal when it came out in 1993. The biggest bombshell was an allegation from his first wife, Ivana \uc2 Trump\uc2 , that Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  had raped her -- a claim that originated in a deposition she gave during their divorce proceedings. She later recanted the claim, and Mr. Hurt's book included a statement from Ms. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , inserted in the flyleaf, clarifying that she felt emotionally and not physically violated by her then husband. Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  never sued.\par \par \uc2 But when Mr. Hurt asked Norton to republish the book this year, it declined, citing legal risks and the expenses associated with legal vetting and corrections. Norton, which declined to comment, returned the publication rights to Mr. Hurt.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Hurt, a former Newsweek correspondent and the author of several nonfiction books, self-published ''Lost Tycoon'' on Amazon and quickly sold 60 copies. Then he got an offer from Echo Point Books & Media, a small Vermont publisher that specializes in republishing out-of-print books. Echo Point is now running a Kickstarter campaign to raise $5,000 to pay for a small print run of the book: ''Publish the book that \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  doesn't want you to read,'' the pitch on Kickstarter says.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Hurt is eager to get the book out before the \uc2 election\uc2 . ''Time's a wasting,'' he said. ''Hopefully this time next year, nobody will want to read about \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2 .''\par \par \uc2 Follow Alexandra Alter on Twitter @xanalter.\par \par \uc2 A bevy of books about Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2 . Among the works are biographies, parodies, comic books and satires, including a faux thriller titled ''The Day of the Donald,'' which takes place two years into a \uc2 Trump\uc2  presidency, and a mock children's book, ''A Child's First Book of \uc2 Trump\uc2 .''

\par\par \uc2 MEDIATOR\par \uc2 Business/Financial Desk; SECTB\par \b \uc2 Fair Play in a Fact-Challenged Political Landscape\b0\par\par\uc2 By JIM RUTENBERG \par \uc2 1,568 \uc2 words\par \uc2 4 July 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 1\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 CORRECTION APPENDEDThe Fourth of July is my favorite holiday. I am from Philadelphia. And I write a column about media.\par \par \uc2 What better way, then, to celebrate the Fourth in this space than to quote that great Philadelphian Benjamin Franklin, an editor and signer of the Declaration of Independence and a founding father of the independent American press?\par \par \uc2 There's one Franklin statement in particular that has a special resonance right now, something he wrote in his Pennsylvania Gazette: ''It is a principle among printers that when truth has fair play, it will always prevail over falsehood.''\par \par \uc2 The operative phrase is ''when truth has fair play.'' Now, think about the last year in global and American politics. Then ask yourself, ''Does it?''\par \par \uc2 I can make a pretty strong argument for ''does not.''\par \par \uc2 Exhibit A comes by way of \uc2 CNN\uc2 , which waded into new territory a few days ago by hiring \uc2 Corey Lewandowski\uc2 , \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's recently fired campaign manager, as an on-air commentator.\par \par \uc2 Reporters and media critics have devoted a lot of ink and pixels to Mr. Lewandowski's hiring. How could the network enlist someone who had been arrested for roughly pulling Michelle Fields, the former Breitbart News reporter, away from Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  as she tried to interview him at a public event? (Prosecutors in Florida dropped the charges, but they did not dispute the incident.)\par \par \uc2 What kind of message was \uc2 CNN\uc2  sending by hiring a political operative associated with some of the most aggressive anti-media behavior in modern political history, an enforcer of the \uc2 Trump\uc2  campaign's media blacklist?\par \par \uc2 But the true journalistic heart stopper was contained in the news that Mr. Lewandowski was bound by what even Mr. Lewandowski described as a ''strict confidentiality agreement.''\par \par \uc2 Neither \uc2 CNN\uc2  nor Mr. Lewandowski has provided details about its stipulations (though they should). But The Associated Press unearthed a standard \uc2 Trump\uc2  nondisclosure form that prohibits staff from disclosing anything ''of a private, proprietary or confidential nature.'' And who gets to decide what should be private and confidential? Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , of course.\par \par \uc2 The agreement also includes a non-disparagement clause. And it applies during employment with Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's campaign and ''at all times thereafter,'' which is another way of saying ''forever.''\par \par \uc2 It won't smash the republic. Still, in a small but significant way, Mr. Lewandowski's hiring represents a signal moment in political journalism's evolving embrace of political operatives: A major mainstream news organization is using a commentator who is legally prohibited from sharing the unvarnished truth on the subject -- Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  -- he was hired to talk about.\par \par \uc2 Some of the media criticism that followed Mr. Lewandowski's hiring questioned the ruckus around it, given that television news already has its share of conflicted pundits tied to ''super PACs'' or clients with business at stake in the political debate.\par \par \uc2 CNN\uc2 's thinking apparently holds that Mr. Lewandowski provides pro-\uc2 Trump\uc2  balance for the network at a time when many of its regular Republican analysts are \uc2 Trump\uc2  detractors. In that case, they could ask, how does a nondisclosure agreement get in the way of Mr. Lewandowski's role as a \uc2 Trump\uc2  booster?\par \par \uc2 After all, as Paul Farhi of The \uc2 Washington Post\uc2  captured so comprehensively last month, all of the television news networks -- hardly just \uc2 CNN\uc2  -- hire commentators who play specific roles on their panels: ''pro-Hillary,'' ''pro-\uc2 Trump\uc2 ,'' Democrat, Republican; centrist, rightist, leftist. In presidential \uc2 election\uc2  cycles, such role-playing rates well in the Nielsen numbers.\par \par \uc2 But, going back to my fellow Philadelphian, wise old Ben: What happens to the balance between truth and falsehood when an important portion of the national news media hands the political debate over to partisan operatives who, as a rule, skew the facts -- or abandon them -- in the service of their own political ends or business interests?\par \par \uc2 There's a glaring cautionary answer to be found across the pond, in Britain, where the media is avowedly more partisan, especially in the tabloid newspapers that continue to hold great sway.\par \par \uc2 In the lead-up to the startling vote there to leave the \uc2 European Union\uc2 , and for many years before, the larger and more conservative newspapers ran aggressive campaigns pushing for what became known as Brexit.\par \par \uc2 One of the biggest proponents of the exit was former Mayor Boris Johnson of London, who was, after all, a onetime reporter for The Times of London and The Daily Telegraph, where he still writes a column. (He was fired from The Times for fabricating a quote.)\par \par \uc2 As Martin Fletcher, a former associate editor of The Times of London, wrote last week in The \uc2 New York Times\uc2 , Mr. Johnson made his name as a journalist writing about the plans of bureaucrats in the \uc2 European Union\uc2  to ''ban Britain's favorite potato chips'' and ''standardize condom sizes.'' The articles, Mr. Fletcher wrote, ''bore scant relation to the truth,'' but they helped spawn an anti-\uc2 European Union\uc2  movement in British journalism just the same.\par \par \uc2 As the vote approached, pro-Brexit newspapers -- including The Sun, The Daily Mail, The Express and The Telegraph -- wrote stories that exaggerated how many immigrants were coming to Britain because of its E.U. membership and their effects on social services, reported that Queen Elizabeth II was secretly pro-Brexit, and quoted claims from pro-Leave politicians that Britain was sending 350 million pounds ($464 million) a week to the \uc2 European Union\uc2  that could be used instead to shore up the \uc2 National Health Service\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 The Independent Press Standards Organization in Britain issued several rulings for inaccuracy -- including one for the headline ''Queen Backs Brexit,'' which ran in The Sun. But the partisan press climate meant all facts were up for debate. Nothing could stand out as Platonic truth.\par \par \uc2 After the vote passed, Nigel Farage, a leading Brexit campaigner, said the Vote Leave campaign had been mistaken in saying the savings from the \u163\'00\'A3350 million that supposedly went to the E.U. -- itself misleading -- could be used for the health service. That was followed by various expressions of regret by some pro-Brexit voters who now believe they were misled.\par \par \uc2 ''The context for the referendum vote was a public which had been poorly'' informed, ''if not misinformed about the issue,'' the former Guardian editor \uc2 Alan Rusbridger\uc2  told me.\par \par \uc2 The media in the United States is not quite where Britain's is in terms of partisanship, though it seems to inch closer every year. And cable news is not the sole driver of political knowledge. But it can be the center ring for political discourse, especially in prime time. What happens there can drive a major campaign theme for the following day or longer.\par \par \uc2 In the case of Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's surrogates, they regularly go on television to push the point of the day from a candidate who, according to the fact-checking organization PolitiFact, has asserted more outright falsehoods than all the other candidates who ran for president this year combined. PolitiFact rated 60 percent of Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's statements as false, compared with 13 percent of \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's.\par \par \uc2 Jeffrey Lord, a \uc2 Trump\uc2  supporter and a commentator on \uc2 CNN\uc2 , told the \uc2 CNN\uc2  host Brian Stelter that such fact-checking analyses were an ''elitist, media-type thing.'' But the amount of falsity on cable news nonetheless requires a lot of on-the-spot declarations of ''that's nonsense'' in a medium that doesn't provide a lot of room for it.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Lewandowski has frequently wandered past the bounds of truth, including when he said he never touched Ms. Fields. Videotape showed the opposite.\par \par \uc2 To its credit, \uc2 CNN\uc2  does have a crew of aggressive anchors like Jake Tapper, Alisyn Camerota and Erin Burnett, all of whom have pushed Mr. Lewandowski for as unvarnished a view of Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  as he could offer.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Lewandowski told Ms. Burnett he'd call ''balls and strikes'' in spite of his agreement with Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 . But when he weighed in on Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's big economic speech last Tuesday, all he saw was a home run (''Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's best speech of the presidential cycle,'' he gushed).\par \par \uc2 Mr. Franklin was all for providing a multitude of voices through his press. ''When men differ in opinion, both sides ought to equally have the advantage of being heard by the publick,'' he wrote in his ''Apology for Printers.''\par \par \uc2 In a twist on the quote I used above, he added, ''When truth and error have fair play, the former is always an overmatch for the latter.''\par \par \uc2 Let's give it a try.\par \par \uc2 Correction: July 12, 2016, Tuesday\par \par \uc2 This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: The Mediator column on July 4, about misinformation in the news coverage of American and British politics, referred imprecisely to a comment by Nigel Farage, a leader in the British movement to leave the \uc2 European Union\uc2 . While Mr. Farage characterized as ''a mistake'' the pro-exit claim that savings from the British contribution to the \uc2 European Union\uc2  would be dedicated to the \uc2 National Health Service\uc2 , he was referring to statements by the VoteLeave campaign of which he was not officially a part; he was not speaking about his own statements.\par \par \uc2 Corey Lewandowski (B1); Corey Lewandowski, Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's former campaign manager, was hired by CNN as an on-air commentator.

\par\par \uc2 WHITE HOUSE LETTER\par \uc2 National Desk; SECTA\par \b \uc2 Globalization Demands \uc2 Obama\uc2 's Oratorical Skills\b0\par\par\uc2 By MARK LANDLER \par \uc2 1,207 \uc2 words\par \uc2 4 July 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 3\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 WASHINGTON -- When President \uc2 Obama\uc2  travels to North Carolina and Europe this week, he will press an argument that could define foreign policy in the last six months of his presidency: that Americans and Europeans must not forsake their open, interconnected societies for the nativism and nationalism preached by \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2  or Britain's Brexiteers.\par \par \uc2 Few presidents have put more faith than Mr. Obama in the power of words to persuade audiences to accept a complex idea, whether it is the morality of a just war or the imperfect nature of American society. Yet countering the anti-immigration and anti-free-trade slogans in this \uc2 election\uc2  year will require all of his oratorical skills.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Obama road-tested his pitch over the last two weeks in two friendly venues: Silicon Valley and Canada. This week, he will take the case to North Carolina, a swing state that has been hard hit by the forces of globalization, and to a \uc2 NATO\uc2  meeting in Poland, where the alliance members will grapple with the effects of Britain's vote to leave the \uc2 European Union\uc2 , known as Brexit.\par \par \uc2 In Warsaw, Mr. Obama will sit next to Britain's lame-duck prime minister, \uc2 David Cameron\uc2 , whose political career was ended by his miscalculation over holding the referendum on \uc2 European Union\uc2  membership. But first, in Charlotte, N.C., he will campaign with \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , his former secretary of state and the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, who reversed her position on Mr. Obama's Asian trade deal, formally called the Trans-Pacific Partnership, after many in her party turned sharply against free trade.\par \par \uc2 ''President \uc2 Obama\uc2  has made a valiant attempt to build support for freer trade,'' said Eswar S. Prasad, a professor of trade policy at Cornell University. ''But the arguments in favor of free trade lack rhetorical and political resonance, especially amidst a heated political campaign.''\par \par \uc2 The case for ambitious trade deals, Dr. Prasad said, is that they allow the United States to set the rules for its dealings with other countries, and to wield greater geopolitical influence. Yet those arguments are easily overshadowed by the simple, if dubious, assertion that the losses to the American economy from these deals are greater than the benefits.\par \par \uc2 ''\uc2 Obama\uc2 's ability to sway the debate about free trade has been hampered by those in his own party feeling the heat from constituents who are up in arms about weak employment and wage growth,'' Dr. Prasad said.\par \par \uc2 White House officials said Mr. Obama would not hesitate to make a strong case for the Trans-Pacific Partnership on the campaign trail. But \uc2 Josh Earnest\uc2 , the press secretary, said the president's remarks on Tuesday in Charlotte would probably focus more on areas where he and Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  agreed.\par \par \uc2 Then, in Europe, Mr. Obama may find a more receptive audience, given the deep misgivings over the British vote.\par \par \uc2 ''His timing is pretty good,'' said David Axelrod, a former senior adviser to Mr. Obama. ''If he arrived the week before, the party would have been rip-roaring. Now everybody is sitting there with an ice pack on their forehead. They might be ready to listen to some sensible advice.''\par \par \uc2 The departure of Britain from the \uc2 European Union\uc2  is likely to have significant, if not immediate, effects on Europe's security. Some experts express fear that it will weaken the response to Russian aggression in Ukraine, for example. At the Warsaw meeting, a senior administration official said, Mr. Obama plans to emphasize the need for the \uc2 European Union\uc2  to cooperate more closely with \uc2 NATO\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 This has long been a goal of the United States, but the exit of Britain from the union makes it more urgent, said the official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity in advance of the \uc2 NATO\uc2  meeting. \uc2 NATO\uc2  and the \uc2 European Union\uc2  could collaborate in countering cyberattacks, coordinating military exercises and patrolling the central Mediterranean.\par \par \uc2 But Britain's departure could pose problems for \uc2 NATO\uc2 . European diplomats said they expected France and Germany to consider closer military integration within the \uc2 European Union\uc2  -- something Britain and the United States have resisted because they view it as competing with the alliance.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Obama spoke out publicly against a ''leave'' vote when he visited Britain in April, and the outcome of that debate was perhaps a harbinger of the challenges he faces in resisting antiglobalism at home. In his speeches, he emphasizes that leaders must recognize the fears and resentments that people feel because of economic dislocation.\par \par \uc2 ''For them, globalization is inherently rigged toward the top 1 percent,'' Mr. Obama said in an address to the \uc2 Canadian Parliament\uc2 . ''I understand that vision. I know why it's tempting.''\par \par \uc2 The problem, the president said, is that it is too late to turn back.\par \par \uc2 ''Restricting trade or giving in to protectionism in this 21st-century economy will not work,'' Mr. Obama said. ''Even if we wanted to, we can't seal ourselves off from the rest of the world. The day after Brexit, people looked around and said: 'Oh! How is this going to work?'''\par \par \uc2 By recognizing people's fears while making the case for an interconnected world, Mr. Axelrod said, the president has found the ''sweet spot'' in the debate. But telling people that they can do nothing to stem the tide of globalization is not a particularly appealing message.\par \par \uc2 At times, it seems that Mr. Obama has suffered his own dislocation. In Ottawa on Wednesday, he took part in a news conference with Prime Minister \uc2 Justin Trudeau\uc2  of Canada and President Enrique Pe\u241\'00\'F1a Nieto of Mexico that was dominated by questions about Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  and the British vote.\par \par \uc2 While Mr. Trudeau was talking about whether Canada would export more hydroelectric power to the United States, Mr. Obama began scribbling notes. When it was his turn to speak, he abruptly veered into a discussion of the meaning of populism, a term often used to describe the political appeals made by Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  or the pro-Brexit campaigners.\par \par \uc2 ''I'm not prepared to concede the notion that some of the rhetoric that's been popping up is populist,'' Mr. Obama said. He described his own agenda as populist, in that he wanted to help ordinary people get economic opportunities, working mothers get child care and children get access to education. A candidate who has never worked on behalf of social justice or the interests of the poor, he said, could not be a populist.\par \par \uc2 ''That's not the measure of populism,'' Mr. Obama said. ''That's nativism. Or xenophobia. Or worse.''\par \par \uc2 When he had finished, an obviously worked-up Mr. Obama apologized for the digression, saying that as he neared the end of his presidency, he felt entitled to go ''on these occasional rants.''\par \par \uc2 The next day, Mr. Earnest was asked if the president planned any more of these rants. ''Considering we've got another six and a half months to go before the end of the presidency,'' he replied, ''I think it's likely we're all going to get to enjoy at least one more.''\par \par \uc2 President Obama discussed the meaning of populism at a news conference in Ottawa last week.

\par\par \uc2 LETTER FROM WASHINGTON\par \uc2 Politics; SECT\par \b \uc2 From a New President, New Justices\b0\par\par\uc2 By ALBERT R. HUNT | BLOOMBERG VIEW \par \uc2 683 \uc2 words\par \uc2 4 July 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 The New York Times on the Web\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 For a half century, presidential candidates have routinely claimed that there are no bigger stakes in the \uc2 election\uc2  than the next appointments to the Supreme Court.\par \par \uc2 This year, for the first time since 1968, the dire warnings could actually have an important effect on voting behavior.\par \par \uc2 Since the death of Justice Antonin Scalia in February, the court has deadlocked 4-4 on four cases, including a few big ones. On a number of others, a single vote determined the outcome. In addition, Judge \uc2 Merrick B. Garland\uc2 , the nominee to replace Mr. Scalia, will still be waiting for review by the Senate on \uc2 Election\uc2  Day; two other justices will be in their 80s, and one will be 78.\par \par \uc2 It is likely that \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  or \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2  will have at least two or three appointments in a first term. And that will shape a number of important issues, including immigration, racial preferences, the role of unions and environmental issues.\par \par \uc2 The significance is underscored by the last two presidents. Had Vice President Al Gore won the Electoral College vote as well as the popular vote in 2000, the court seats now occupied by Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Samuel Alito would have been filled by more liberal jurists, giving progressives a majority. Likewise, if Republicans had won the White House in 2008, \uc2 Elena Kagan\uc2  and \uc2 Sonia Sotomayor\uc2  wouldn't be on the court and conservatives would enjoy a comfortable majority.\par \par \uc2 The stakes are even more obvious now. The last time there was an open seat during a presidential \uc2 election\uc2  was 1956. That October, President Dwight D. Eisenhower tapped William Brennan in a recess appointment for the slot. In 1968, Chief Justice Earl Warren declared his intention to step down, but President Lyndon Johnson's choice to succeed him, Justice Abe Fortas, was blocked by the Senate.\par \par \uc2 This year, both candidates are seizing on the issue. Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  has released a list of 10 conservative jurists he might consider for court vacancies.\par \par \uc2 Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  hasn't gone that far, but she has vowed that any appointee would favor abortion rights and overturning the court's recent campaign finance laws.\par \par \uc2 Activists on the right and left are ginned up and certainly will make the court part of their fund-raising.\par \par \uc2 Conservatives have done a slightly better job of seizing on the issue. They may be helped this time by court decisions on affirmative action, abortion, same-sex marriage and upholding the Affordable Care Act that the right found disappointing.\par \par \uc2 They aren't confident, however, that a President \uc2 Trump\uc2 , a recent convert to conservative causes, would be an ally, even though they liked his list of potential appointees.\par \par \uc2 Miguel Estrada, one of the most prominent conservative legal intellectuals, though he is a fan of Mr. Garland, acknowledged that he probably wouldn't like Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's appointees. He's not assuaged, however, by Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's list: ''It's like a game of Russian roulette with \uc2 Trump\uc2 ,'' Mr. Estrada said.\par \par \uc2 ''He's just as likely to appoint Judge Judy as anyone on that list,'' he added, referring to the star of a reality television program.\par \par \uc2 Liberals hope Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  will stir their base, especially Hispanics. One of the deadlocked Supreme Court decisions this term effectively suspended President Obama's executive order aimed at preventing millions of undocumented workers from being deported. It is likely to be considered again.\par \par \uc2 There are questions about Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's court appointments, too. She once said that she'd love to name Mr. Obama to the bench -- William Howard Taft became chief justice after he left the White House -- but that's unlikely.\par \par \uc2 As president, she probably would like to tap someone younger, more liberal and of a more diverse background than the 63-year-old Judge Garland, who was first nominated in March. But to pass him over would be a rebuke not only to the respected judge, but also to Mr. Obama. That's probably not the way she'd like to start a presidency.\par \par \uc2 Document NYTF000020160704ec740004b\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

But in issuing the prohibition this year, \uc2 Mr. Obama\uc2 's chief of staff, Denis McDonough, decided to ''send a signal about the primacy of the Obama administration's responsibility to manage the government and serve the American people,'' said Jennifer Friedman, the deputy White House press secretary.\par \par \uc2 It is hardly the first judgment that \uc2 Mr. Obama\uc2 's team has had to make about how deeply to get involved as the president takes on an increasingly active role in the raucous campaign to succeed him -- decisions that involve not only considerations of policy and appearances, but legal ones, as well.\par \par \uc2 Federal law requires top appointees to carefully separate their official duties from political ones, and those distinctions have taken on added significance this year, given the unusual nature of the race to succeed \uc2 Mr. Obama\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 White House officials believe that the campaign presents a particularly tricky set of challenges: a presumptive Republican presidential nominee, \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , who routinely prompts controversy with his provocative statements and positions; a presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , who once served in the administration and has considered several cabinet secretaries as potential running mates; and a still-popular president who looms over the race.\par \par \uc2 ''This is largely an effort to delineate as clearly as possible the public, official governing responsibilities we have at the White House, and separate that from politics,'' said \uc2 Josh Earnest\uc2 , the White House press secretary.\par \par \uc2 Administration officials must walk a fine line, one that sometimes involves hairsplitting differences.\par \par \uc2 Hurling a personal insult at Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  from a White House lectern? Off limits. But Mr. Earnest can note the many ways in which Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's positions are at odds with the president's.\par \par \uc2 Headlining a fund-raiser for Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 ? No problem for a cabinet secretary, as long as the secretary does not use his or her official title or ask for contributions.\par \par \uc2 The White House counsel, Neil Eggleston, and members of his staff have stepped up their warnings to White House officials and other top administration appointees to exercise care that their political activity stays within the law, which limits the use of official resources for partisan activities.\par \par \uc2 At the same time, lawyers at the Office of Special Counsel, which enforces the federal law that restricts partisan activity by government officials, have increased their investigations of federal employees and have been warning \uc2 Mr. Obama\uc2 's top advisers and appointees to watch what they say and do when it comes to the presidential campaign.\par \par \uc2 The president and vice president are exempt from many of the legal strictures. But even \uc2 Mr. Obama\uc2  has taken precautions to separate his role as the head of the Democratic Party from his official duties. When \uc2 Mr. Obama\uc2  taped his endorsement video last month for Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  at the White House, it was done in the Map Room -- part of the residence, rather than his West Wing offices -- and Mr. Earnest was quick to note that it was ''not filmed at government expense.''\par \par \uc2 This week, when \uc2 Mr. Obama\uc2  travels to North Carolina for his first campaign appearance with Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , the cost of the trip on Air Force One will be shared between the White House and Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's campaign, according to a complicated formula worked out by his legal counsel to comply with federal \uc2 election\uc2  law.\par \par \uc2 The risk of ethics breaches is increased by the sheer number of cabinet secretaries active on the campaign trail. A handful have publicly endorsed Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , and three -- Juli\u225\'00\'E1n Castro of the \uc2 Department of Housing and Urban Development\uc2 , Thomas E. Perez of the Labor Department and Tom Vilsack of the Agriculture Department -- routinely surface on lists of potential vice-presidential candidates.\par \par \uc2 White House officials emphasized that there had been no finding that cabinet secretaries were barred by law from speaking at the convention, although \uc2 Mr. Obama\uc2 's lawyers concluded before the 2012 \uc2 election\uc2  that they must not use the title of ''secretary'' if they did.\par \par \uc2 High-profile slip-ups from the past serve as cautionary tales. In 2012, the Office of Special Counsel concluded that Kathleen Sebelius, then the secretary of health and human services, had violated the Hatch Act -- the 1939 law that governs federal employees' participation in political activity -- by making ''extemporaneous partisan remarks'' during a speech at a gala for the \uc2 Human Rights Campaign\uc2 , a gay rights group, in North Carolina. Ms. Sebelius, who asserted that the Democratic lieutenant governor ''needs to be the next governor of North Carolina'' and that \uc2 Mr. Obama\uc2  should be ''president for another four years,'' later said the comments were an unscripted ''mistake.''\par \par \uc2 A year earlier, the special counsel found that the Office of Political Affairs in George W. Bush's White House had committed numerous violations of the Hatch Act during the 2006 midterm congressional elections, including by coordinating requests from members of Congress to have cabinet secretaries make campaign appearances in their districts.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Obama\uc2  shuttered the office, and when it reopened in 2014, his lawyers issued new guidance about how to comply with the law. They have erred on the side of caution ever since, current and former officials said.\par \par \uc2 ''They're pitching a no-hitter in the ninth inning of the administration, and why screw it up at the end?'' said Norman Eisen, a former special counsel for ethics and government reform under \uc2 Mr. Obama\uc2 . ''Historically, the last months of an administration are a time when people get lazy and things go off the rails, so extra vigilance is called for.''\par \par \uc2 The Hatch Act, which was enacted after officials in Franklin D. Roosevelt's administration were accused of using New Deal programs to sway the outcome of the 1938 congressional elections, is designed to prevent political favoritism and coercion in the administration and ensure that citizens receive the same service from the federal government, no matter their political affiliation.\par \par \uc2 In theory, it means that most federal employees may participate in partisan politics only on their own time -- following strict rules -- and at their own expense. In practice, it can lead to awkward contortions. Mr. Earnest and other administration press representatives are advised to pivot away from overt questions about partisan politics and stick to ''safe zones,'' such as what the president himself has said publicly.\par \par \uc2 At the Agriculture Department, Mr. Vilsack requires all political appointees to attend hourlong ethics and legal briefings during the campaign season, and asks agency lawyers to present an ''ethics moment'' each week to explain the intricacies of the rules, said Matt Herrick, his communications director.\par \par \uc2 When he wrote an opinion article in The Gazette of Cedar Rapids, Iowa, in August endorsing Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , Mr. Vilsack left out his official title, signing it as the former governor of the state.\par \par \uc2 ''With Republicans in control of the House and the Senate, you can bet that the investigative arm will swing into action very quickly if anything is even hinted at being wrong,'' said Richard W. Painter, a law professor at the University of Minnesota who served as Mr. Bush's chief ethics lawyer from 2005 to 2007. ''The public is very cynical about ethics issues across the board, so anybody in the administration going even close to the line is not going to help Secretary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 .''\par \par \uc2 Find out what you need to know about the 2016 presidential race today, and get politics news updates via \uc2 Facebook\uc2 , \uc2 Twitter\uc2  and the First Draft newsletter.\par \par \uc2 Denis McDonough, the White House chief of staff, issued the prohibition on addressing the Democratic convention.

\par\par \uc2 GRACE NOTES\par \uc2 Metropolitan Desk; SECTA\par \b \uc2 Marching Behind a Presidential Candidate, With Help From a Famous Name\b0\par\par\uc2 By JAMES BARRON \par \uc2 1,557 \uc2 words\par \uc2 4 July 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 16\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 FARMINGTON, Conn. -- John Philip Sousa IV was explaining the campaign to draft Ben Carson as a presidential candidate -- which he helped to spearhead -- when his cellphone rang. That established that his ringtone was ''The Stars and Stripes Forever.''\par \par \uc2 Mr. Sousa, the great-grandson of John Philip Sousa, the March King, is a conservative activist who believes that the famous bandleader -- the superstar composer of superpatriotic standards such as ''The Liberty Bell'' and ''The Thunderer'' -- would be troubled by what the United States has become.\par \par \uc2 ''Absolutely no doubt in my mind whatsoever,'' Mr. Sousa, 68, said.\par \par \uc2 ''Sousa would understand 'Make America Great' because when he was alive, America was great,'' he said. ''Not that it didn't have issues and problems. He lived through the Civil War and World War I. But when the flag went by, you put your hand over your heart.''\par \par \uc2 Mr. Sousa said he was ''aghast'' when people do other things while ''The Star-Spangled Banner,'' written by Francis Scott Key, is played at football games. (For the record, he is a \uc2 New England Patriots\uc2  fan. ''Big time,'' he said.)\par \par \uc2 But the 2016 Committee, the ''super PAC'' that worked to nudge Mr. Carson into running for president, is not promoting \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , the presumptive Republican nominee, at least not directly. ''The 2016 Committee is committed to defeating Hillary,'' Mr. Sousa said, and it is planning to run commercials on black radio stations in nine swing states. He said that he had employed a similar strategy to help conservative candidates in North Carolina and Louisiana in 2014, with the goal of helping Republicans take control of the Senate, which he hoped would persuade Mr. Carson to run for president. This year he had a $4 million budget in mind. ''If we can take the black vote away from Hillary,'' Mr. Sousa said, ''then Hillary will lose.''\par \par \uc2 After the November \uc2 election\uc2 , he has planned another focus for the 2016 Committee, including a name change. It will become the Stars and Stripes Forever Super PAC, he said.\par \par \uc2 ''What that is going to do is identify conservative minorities to run for Senate seats,'' he said. ''If the Republican Party doesn't become more inclusive, and if the Republican Party doesn't get more minorities involved at senior levels of government, it will be over for the Republican Party.'' He paused, then said, ''It may be over anyway.''\par \par \uc2 In person, sitting on the patio behind his townhouse in this central Connecticut town, Mr. Sousa was polite. He is less so on \uc2 Facebook\uc2 , where, between posts about his great-grandfather and his own efforts to promote Sousa's music and bands that play it, he has attacked President Obama and \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 After the massacre in a gay nightclub in Orlando, Fla., he put the blame for the shooting on the president. Mr. Sousa wrote, using an adjective that cannot be printed here, that Mr. Obama's way of ''dealing with Muslim terrorists, with immigration, with political correctness resulted in this dreadful tragedy.''\par \par \uc2 In April, he assailed Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  after complaining about the Navy's decision to name a guided-missile destroyer after former Senator Carl M. Levin, a Democrat from Michigan, who was chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee but never served in the military.\par \par \uc2 For years, Mr. Sousa has urged the Navy to name a warship after his great-grandfather (the S.S. John Philip Sousa, a cargo ship built during World War II, was sold after the war and scrapped in the 1960s). After the announcement about Mr. Levin, Mr. Sousa wrote that nearly 200 Medal of Honor recipients from the Navy and the Marine Corps had been passed over. Mr. Sousa also wrote that the choice ignored Navy guidelines and tradition.\par \par \uc2 ''This liberal military-hating military has got to go,'' he added in the post. Then, referring to Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  by her initials, he added, ''And if there is any doubt in your mind, H.R.C. will do the same types of un-American things.''\par \par \uc2 Mr. Sousa became interested in Mr. Carson after working on Americans for Sheriff Joe, a political action committee that supported Sheriff Joe Arpaio of Maricopa County, Ariz., who is known for conducting workplace raids and neighborhood roundups of undocumented immigrants. Mr. Sousa is well aware that the bandmaster's parents were immigrants, and he sees no contradiction.\par \par \uc2 ''There's legal immigration and illegal immigration,'' he said, noting that his great-great-grandparents had entered the country legally. ''I'm all for limited legal immigration.'' He said that Mr. Arpaio was merely enforcing existing immigration laws. ''He didn't make up his own laws,'' Mr. Sousa said, adding that he liked Mr. Carson's immigration plan, which would have let undocumented immigrants register as guest workers and pay any back taxes they might have owed (with penalties). They could have then applied for citizenship, but would not have received preferential treatment.\par \par \uc2 But back to how he discovered Mr. Carson. He said that in summer 2013, he and three or four friends were talking about setting up a super PAC for congressional races.\par \par \uc2 ''I said no, that bores me, there are too many congressmen,'' he recalled. He said he asked if the others had seen Mr. Carson's speech at the National Prayer Breakfast a few months earlier. With the president and the first lady on the dais, ''he destroyed Obamacare, political correctness and the redistribution of wealth,'' Mr. Sousa said. ''I thought, 'This is a guy with real guts.'''\par \par \uc2 Mr. Sousa and his friends considered a campaign to draft Mr. Carson to run for a Senate seat in Maryland. ''My instinct told me he wouldn't be interested,'' Mr. Sousa said, so they decided to see about a run for president. He contacted a friend who handles direct mail fund-raising.\par \par \uc2 ''He said, 'Be prepared to lose money and write me a check,''' Mr. Sousa recalled.\par \par \uc2 The committee sent out 350,000 letters. ''We netted $7 on every piece we sent out,'' Mr. Sousa said. ''The average was around $40.'' And all for someone Mr. Sousa had never met.\par \par \uc2 Before long, Mr. Carson appeared on Fox News and said he would not stand in the way of the draft committee. ''We took that as a tremendous green light,'' Mr. Sousa said. ''He could have just as easily said, 'I'm aware of this, and my attorneys are sending him a cease-and-desist order.'''\par \par \uc2 Eventually, they met. ''For about 90 seconds,'' Mr. Sousa said, and they did not talk politics. ''I gave him a copy of my book about my great-grandfather. He shook my hand and said, 'Thanks very much.''' Mr. Sousa went on to write another book, ''Ben Carson: Rx for America.'' (''I didn't take a dime for that,'' he said.)\par \par \uc2 The draft-Carson committee focused on states with early nominating processes, such as Iowa and South Carolina. ''The campaign management team Dr. Carson started with did a great job in the beginning, but it needed fresh blood -- which it eventually got, but it was a day late and a dollar short,'' Mr. Sousa said. ''And then he finally got out of the race and hooked up with \uc2 Trump\uc2 .''\par \par \uc2 So what about Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 ? ''I think he is substantially better than Hillary,'' he said.\par \par \uc2 That sounded lukewarm.\par \par \uc2 ''There are pieces of \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  that I am very excited about, and there are pieces of \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  that make me very nervous,'' he said. ''I don't think I'm unique in that aspect.'' Mr. Sousa said he liked ''the fact that he is not a politician, he's not polished, he's not smooth, he's not slick, he doesn't have the \uc2 Marco Rubio\uc2  or Ted Cruz answers. For me, that's O.K.''\par \par \uc2 What about Mr. Sousa's great-grandfather? How political was he?\par \par \uc2 ''We don't know if Sousa was a Democrat or a Republican,'' he said. ''We do know that Sousa performed at numerous Republican functions and never at a Democratic function.''\par \par \uc2 According to a biographer, Sousa once said that a good march made ''goose pimples chase each other up and down your spine.'' Sousa set off a lot of goose pimples: He wrote more than 130 marches, 15 operettas and 70 songs, according to Grove Music Online. Sousa's band crisscrossed the United States, playing his marches and arrangements of pieces by composers that included Grieg, Dvorak and Wagner (meaning: no violins, no violas, no cellos, no basses).\par \par \uc2 The sheet music for Sousa's first big hit, a march called ''The Gladiator,'' sold more than a million copies. How much does Sousa's music bring in nowadays in royalties?\par \par \uc2 ''Almost nothing,'' Mr. Sousa said. Sousa was a co-founder of American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers, so there are some royalties that come through Ascap. ''Last year, it was $1,500. Not quite retireable money.''\par \par \uc2 Follow The \uc2 New York Times\uc2 's Metro coverage on \uc2 Facebook\uc2  and \uc2 Twitter\uc2 , and sign up for the New York Today newsletter.\par \par \uc2 John Philip Sousa IV, left, is the great-grandson of John Philip Sousa, above, who composed ''The Stars and Stripes Forever.''

\par\par \uc2 National Desk; SECTA\par \b \uc2 A Second President \uc2 Clinton\uc2 ? Mapping Out Her First 100 Days\b0\par\par\uc2 By PATRICK HEALY \par \uc2 1,946 \uc2 words\par \uc2 4 July 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 1\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Should she win the presidency, \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  would quickly try to find common ground with Republicans on an immigration overhaul and infrastructure spending, risking the wrath of liberals who would like nothing more than to twist the knife in a wounded opposition party.\par \par \uc2 In her first 100 days, she would also tap women to make up half of her cabinet in hopes of bringing a new tone and collaborative sensibility to Washington, while also looking past Wall Street to places like Silicon Valley for talent -- perhaps wooing \uc2 Sheryl Sandberg\uc2  from \uc2 Facebook\uc2 , and maybe asking \uc2 Tim Cook\uc2  from \uc2 Apple\uc2  to become the first openly gay cabinet secretary.\par \par \uc2 Former President \uc2 Bill \uc2 Clinton\uc2  would keep a low public profile, granting few interviews and avoiding any moves that could create headaches for his wife, like his recent meeting with Attorney General Loretta Lynch during the F.B.I.'s investigation into Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's email practices.\par \par \uc2 Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  would even schmooze differently than the past few presidents have. Not one to do business over golf or basketball, she would bring back the intimate style of former Presidents Ronald Reagan and Lyndon B. Johnson, negotiating over adult beverages. Picture a steady stream of senators, congressmen and other leaders raising a glass and talking policy in the Oval Office with her and her likely chief of staff, John D. Podesta, as her husband pops in with a quick thought or a disarming compliment.\par \par \uc2 Deeply confident that she would perform better as the president than as a political candidate, Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  wants to pursue a whole new approach at the White House to try to break through years of partisan gridlock, according to a dozen campaign advisers and allies who described her goals and outlook. From policy goals and personnel to her instinct for patiently cultivating the enemy, Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  thinks she would be a better dealmaker than President \uc2 Obama\uc2  if she finds willing partners on the other side.\par \par \uc2 Her opening might be a narrow one. She faces skepticism on the right about her willingness to compromise and her potential use of executive actions, and there is outright suspicion on the left that she might sell out progressive goals for the sake of bipartisan action with Republicans.\par \par \uc2 Still, Democrats close to her say she has a real touch with power brokers in both parties that could yield surprising results.\par \par \uc2 ''Her greatest strength is that she really listens to people, she understands what their political and policy needs are, and she tries to find that space where you can compromise,'' said Neera Tanden, a former top domestic policy adviser to Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  who is now the president of the Center for American Progress, a left-leaning policy institute.\par \par \uc2 ''To be crystal clear: She has led many battles where you can't compromise on principle,'' Ms. Tanden added. ''But she also loves socializing, loves having people and spouses over, and really loves talking over drinks.''\par \par \uc2 Working With G.O.P.\par \par \uc2 In May, The \uc2 New York Times\uc2  examined \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's plans for his first 100 days, during which he said he would focus on divisive campaign promises like building a border wall with Mexico. By contrast, The Times found in its reporting on plans for Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's 100 days that she would look to push issues that might be broadly popular, like infrastructure jobs and a breakthrough on immigration.\par \par \uc2 Her calculation is that she will be dealing with a Republican Party that is deeply fractured and demoralized after the defeat of Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , whose leaders will be searching for ways to show they can govern and to court Hispanics if Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  loses badly with them. Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  also thinks a huge Democratic turnout this fall would put the Senate back in her party's hands, while Speaker Paul D. Ryan and the Republicans would have a reduced majority in the House.\par \par \uc2 What Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  and Mr. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  do not know -- but regularly explore in conversations, according to friends -- is whether Republican leaders, even if their power is diminished, would be in a mood to cooperate.\par \par \uc2 Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  has been a lightning rod for their base for two decades. Much of her budget plan -- about $1.4 trillion in new spending over the next decade and $1.2 trillion in tax increases aimed mostly at the wealthy, according to a recent independent report -- is noxious to House and Senate Republicans.\par \par \uc2 Yet some of them are open to her two early priorities: $275 billion in infrastructure spending, and an immigration bill with a path to citizenship like the one already passed by the Senate. Given how deeply immigration has divided the Republican Party, no other issue would probably reveal more about the ability of a President \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  and a Republican-led House to work together.\par \par \uc2 ''Pro-amnesty Republicans may use Hillary's \uc2 election\uc2  as a pretext to do a deal,'' said \uc2 Mark Krikorian\uc2 , the executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies, which advocates a tough stance on illegal immigration. ''Or maybe Republicans will grow a spine because she is so repellent and they'll want to show that the Republican Party is still alive and willing to be a line of defense against Hillary.''\par \par \uc2 Allies of Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's say they could imagine her, as president-elect, going to Mr. Ryan's office this year to start talking about immigration. She believes in gestures: When Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  was working on the health care overhaul bill during President \uc2 Bill \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's first term, John Kasich, then a ranking Republican on the House Budget Committee, asked one of her aides if Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  would ever consider coming over to Capitol Hill to talk to Republicans about her ideas.\par \par \uc2 ''I said I'd ask her, and she was eager to go, which I think shows a willingness to get things done,'' said the aide, Melanne Verveer, who became Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's White House chief of staff.\par \par \uc2 But many Republicans are not sure how she would use power, given that they think she abused her authority and was overly secretive by using a private email server as secretary of state. Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  has already indicated that she is willing to take executive action on issues if Republicans do not work with her, like expanding background checks for gun sales and ending corporate inversions aimed at avoiding taxes. Executive actions were a flash point between Mr. Obama and Republicans; several said Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  would have a hard time getting them over for cocktails if she shoved executive actions down their throats.\par \par \uc2 ''She can be extremely charming, and she can be the opposite,'' said Tom Davis, a former senior House Republican from Virginia. ''But I think she'll want to build some bridges right away and get back some of the trust that's been missing between the parties for the last 15 years.''\par \par \uc2 Allies of the House and Senate Republican leaders said they would be more inclined to work with a President \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  if she showed a willingness to compromise on priorities for many fiscal conservatives like overhauling Social Security. Yet Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , like many in her party, opposes Republican proposals to cut benefits and raise the retirement age, and she has said she is open to raising the cap on income subject to Social Security taxes. Should she deviate from those positions, leaders of liberal groups -- not to mention her primary race opponent, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, and his full-throated supporters -- would pounce on her.\par \par \uc2 ''She's campaigning on expanding Social Security, not cutting it,'' said Ilya Sheyman, the executive director of MoveOn.org, a progressive organizing group that endorsed Mr. Sanders in the primaries. ''It will be incumbent on a President \uc2 Clinton\uc2  very early in 2017 to force Republicans to accept big, bold ideas or else have them pay the consequences.''\par \par \uc2 Liberal Pressure\par \par \uc2 Some liberals think Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  will be so destructive to the Republican Party that it will be severely weakened after the November \uc2 election\uc2  -- and that Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , as the Democratic leader, should keep her boot on its neck rather than try to play nice and find compromises. Mr. Sanders remains worried that she would abandon progressive ideals to do business with Republicans and has yet to endorse her. Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  has spoken intensely about progressive policies, but she has long wanted to erase the caricature of herself as a partisan warrior -- a ''feminazi,'' as one 1990s phrase went.\par \par \uc2 She hopes to reassure progressives with her executive actions, which would also include new protections for undocumented immigrant parents, as well as her personnel appointments. Having women make up half of her cabinet would be historic (in recent years, a quarter to a third of cabinet positions have been held by women), and Democrats close to Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  say she may decide to retain Ms. Lynch, the nation's first black woman to be attorney general, who took office in April 2015.\par \par \uc2 These Democrats, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss confidential conversations with Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  and her advisers, said that Mr. Podesta, her campaign chairman, would have the right of first refusal on becoming her chief of staff, a job he held under Mr. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 . If he turns it down, Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  would look at appointing a woman to that job, which has been held only by men.\par \par \uc2 ''There's that old saying, 'Nothing about us without us,''' said \uc2 Jennifer Granholm\uc2 , a former Democratic governor of Michigan who supports Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 . ''I mean, a woman as chief of staff, Treasury secretary, a woman at Defense -- it would be incredible.'' (Ms. Granholm is often mentioned as a possible cabinet pick for the Energy Department or another post, but she waved off a question about her interest.)\par \par \uc2 Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  has assigned three top aides -- Ann O'Leary, Ed Meier and Sara Latham -- to oversee transition planning, reporting to Mr. Podesta. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  advisers say they do not expect Mr. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  to be constantly visible in the early months beyond whatever duties Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  gives him on economic policy and foreign affairs. The Clintons' priority is that he does not do anything that distracts from her agenda or overshadows her as the country gets used to having a former president (and a man) in the role of first spouse.\par \par \uc2 One role he will be welcome to play is as an icebreaker at the Oval Office happy hour.\par \par \uc2 Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's ability to use alcohol as a political lubricant came up repeatedly when allies and advisers were asked how she might work with Republicans. Her tale about a drinking contest with Senator \uc2 John McCain\uc2  of Arizona is now a Washington legend. (She said they called it quits before things got out of hand.) She believes that a relaxed, frank discussion is more authentic than trying to bond awkwardly with adversaries over sports -- and more productive than keeping them at arm's length, as Mr. Obama has often done.\par \par \uc2 ''She likes to cajole, she likes to make deals, and she likes to make friends,'' said Richard Socarides, a former policy adviser to \uc2 Bill \uc2 Clinton\uc2  and a longtime supporter of Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 . ''And she knows it's much harder to go after someone who you basically like, who you've had a drink with.''\par \par \uc2 Find out what you need to know about the 2016 presidential race today, and get politics news updates via \uc2 Facebook\uc2 , \uc2 Twitter\uc2  and the First Draft newsletter.\par \par \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , in her initial months in office, would aim for progress on immigration and infrastructure spending, advisers say.

BLOW \par \uc2 898 \uc2 words\par \uc2 4 July 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 21\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 It is easy in an \uc2 election\uc2  cycle that has seen the improbable rise of the preposterous presumptive Republican nominee \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  to center all discussion about the race on him: how poorly he's doing, how outrageous this week's comments were, how damning a new investigative report into his past has proved.\par \par \uc2 But doing so exposes a bias toward the sensational, underselling another rather remarkable story, at least for the month of June: \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  ran an incredibly strong campaign last month.\par \par \uc2 First, let's start with the obvious. As Gallup pointed out last week: ''\uc2 Trump\uc2  and \uc2 Clinton\uc2  are currently among the worst-rated presidential candidates of the last seven decades.'' But the article continued: ''In the race to the bottom, however, \uc2 Trump\uc2 's 42 percent highly unfavorable score easily outpaces \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's 33 percent. Prior to now, 1964 Republican nominee Barry Goldwater had the highest negative score, with 26 percent rating him highly unfavorably in October 1964.''\par \par \uc2 A couple of weeks ago Gallup found that ''Americans' views of \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  have drifted slightly more negative over the past month and a half, with his net favorable rating slipping to -33 for June 13-19 from -28 in the first week of May. Americans' views of \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  have remained significantly less negative than their views of \uc2 Trump\uc2  -- and have been more stable, with her current -13 net favorable rating almost identical to her -14 from early May.''\par \par \uc2 Both \uc2 Clinton\uc2  and \uc2 Trump\uc2  are flawed and damaged candidates, but they aren't equally flawed and damaged. And while \uc2 Trump\uc2  is digging his holes deeper, \uc2 Clinton\uc2  is remaining steady in some and climbing out of others.\par \par \uc2 Clinton\uc2  began the month with a major foreign policy speech that \uc2 CNN\uc2  called an ''evisceration of \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2 ,'' and she never let up. She delivered a stinging critique of \uc2 Trump\uc2  as dangerous in an economic policy speech in Ohio. In an article about the speech, The \uc2 New York Times\uc2  pointed out: ''The barrage comes at a perilous moment for Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , who fired his campaign manager on Monday and faces severe disadvantages in fund-raising and on-the-ground organization. One supporter introducing Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  said gleefully that the campaign had more staff members in Ohio than Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  had nationwide.''\par \par \uc2 How did \uc2 Trump\uc2  respond to this speech? He live-tweeted his objections.\par \par \uc2 When he did give a major speech in response, it was roundly condemned for the numerous falsehoods it contained. But this is nothing new for \uc2 Trump\uc2 . Of all the statements by \uc2 Trump\uc2  that have been examined by the fact-checking site PolitiFact, most have been rated false or ''pants on fire.''\par \par \uc2 Trump\uc2  simply can't muster the discipline that is one of \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's hallmarks. While giving a trade speech in New Hampshire last week, \uc2 Trump\uc2  departed from the subject to again go after Mexico. What is this man's issue with Mexico, anyway?\par \par \uc2 As The Times observed: ''\uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2  was seven minutes into an address on Thursday on the loading dock of a shuttered lighting plant here in New Hampshire, reading from prepared remarks, when he turned his attention to Mexico. That country's leaders are smarter than those in the United States, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee said. Then, as the sound of a plane overhead drowned out his voice, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  went off his script. 'In fact,' Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  said, pointing his finger toward the sky, 'that could be a Mexican plane up there. They're getting ready to attack.'''\par \par \uc2 At times last month, \uc2 Clinton\uc2  and her campaign so outmatched \uc2 Trump\uc2  that the competition wasn't even close.\par \par \uc2 And perhaps most intriguingly, in the wake of the terrorist attacks in Orlando and Turkey and the Brexit vote in England, \uc2 Clinton\uc2  turned what many had seen as a negative for her into a positive: Her cautious delivery, which can sometimes feel a bit guarded and robotic, began to sound steady, reassuring and presidential.\par \par \uc2 Trump\uc2 , in contrast, stumbled terribly, because rather than rise in these moments of trauma and volatility, he sinks to being more, well, \uc2 Trump\uc2 . He made everything about him.\par \par \uc2 After the Orlando massacre, \uc2 Trump\uc2  tweeted: ''Appreciate the congrats for being right on radical Islamic terrorism, I don't want congrats, I want toughness & vigilance. We must be smart!''\par \par \uc2 Following the Brexit vote, MSNBC reported: ''Asked about economic turmoil and the degree to which the Brexit results are undermining the value of the British pound,'' \uc2 Trump\uc2  replied ''that the market decline is good news -- for him. 'If the pound goes down, more people are coming to Turnberry, frankly,' he said, referring to the location of his resort. 'For traveling and for other things, I think it very well could turn out to be positive.' ''\par \par \uc2 There's no way to know if this will continue, especially in light of the ongoing F.B.I. investigation of her emails, but last month \uc2 Clinton\uc2  out-campaigned and outclassed \uc2 Trump\uc2  at every turn. It's important that she is given her due.\par \par \uc2 I invite you to join me on \uc2 Facebook\uc2  and follow me on Twitter (@CharlesMBlow), or e-mail me at chblow@nytimes.com.\par \par \uc2 Follow The \uc2 New York Times\uc2  Opinion section on \uc2 Facebook\uc2  and Twitter (@NYTOpinion), and sign up for the Opinion Today newsletter.\par \par \uc2 CHART: '\uc2 Trump\uc2 's Poor Favorability Scores Rival Barry Goldwater's' (Source: Gallup) \par \par \uc2 Document NYTF000020160704ec740003l\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Laura Catharine Wilson and Toby Brian Fallsgraff are to be married July 3. William M. O'Neill, an Ohio Supreme Court justice, will officiate at Lacuna Lofts, an event space in Chicago.\par \par \uc2 The bride, 31, who will be taking her husband's name, is a documentary filmmaker and the director of engagement for the Kindling Group, a documentary production company in Chicago. She was an associate producer for ''Radical Grace,'' a film that followed nuns who challenge the Vatican, which debuted at Hot Docs Canadian International Documentary Festival in Toronto in April 2015.\par \par \uc2 She graduated from Georgetown and received a master's degree in international development studies from \uc2 George Washington University\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 She is the daughter of Vicki A. Thompson and Bruce G. Wilson of Kenilworth, Ill.\par \par \uc2 The groom, 34, will soon join \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's presidential campaign as the director of digital communications. He graduated from \uc2 Ohio University\uc2  and received a master's degree in political management from \uc2 George Washington University\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 He is the son of Nancy A. Hula of Fort Mill, S.C., and Gary F. Fallsgraff of Cleveland.\par \par \uc2 The couple met in the fall of 2011 while working on the digital team for President \uc2 Obama\uc2 's re-\uc2 election\uc2  campaign and began dating shortly after \uc2 Election\uc2  Day.\par \par \uc2 After President \uc2 Obama\uc2 's victory, Mr. Fallsgraff became the digital director for Organizing for Action, the nonprofit organization that manages the social media and digital accounts for the president. In 2015, Mr. Fallsgraff and his team were filming a video with Mr. Obama at a hotel in Washington during Organizing for Action's Spring Organizing Summit. Knowing he was planning to leave in June, Mr. Fallsgraff took the opportunity to talk with the president.\par \par \uc2 ''I took a quick second when we were wrapping up to tell him it was an honor to have worked for him,'' Mr. Fallsgraff wrote in an email.\par \par \uc2 When the president asked where he was headed, Mr. Fallsgraff admitted that he was not sure yet. But he said he was sure that he would be proposing to his girlfriend, whom he had met while working on the campaign.\par \par \uc2 Those in the room, which was filled with fellow Organizing for Action staffers, Secret Service agents and presidential advisers, were surprised by Mr. Fallsgraff's announcement and congratulated him.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Obama and the Organizing for Action staff then took a group photo, and as the president was leaving, he turned to Mr. Fallsgraff and asked more about his relationship with Ms. Wilson.\par \par \uc2 ''You got a rock picked out and all that?'' Mr. Obama asked. Mr. Fallsgraff told him he had yet to get the ring and asked if the president had any advice.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Obama suggested Mr. Fallsgraff get help from someone Ms. Wilson trusted and understood her taste. When Mr. Fallsgraff suggested that he was thinking of asking Ms. Wilson's best friend, the president responded, ''I think that's the right strategy, but you've got to swear her to secrecy.''\par \par \uc2 The next time Mr. Fallsgraff saw Ms. Wilson's best friend, he pulled her aside. ''I told her I had a mission for her from the president of the United States,'' he said.\par \par \uc2 In September, Mr. Fallsgraff proposed to Ms. Wilson in Chicago at the site of their first date. Ms. Wilson was beaming, but she didn't get emotional until Mr. Fallsgraff told her the story with the president. ''Working on that campaign was such an important time in our lives,'' Ms. Wilson said. ''Never in a million years would I think a story like that would have happened.''\par \par \uc2 Laura Wilson, Toby Fallsgraff (PHOTOGRAPH BY ANNA ZAJAC) \par \par \uc2 Document NYTF000020160703ec73000be\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Dolly Parton is in the middle of her biggest North American tour in 25 years, with dates in more than 60 cities. But she expects to be even busier during the next year. Ms. Parton, 70, one of country music's most enduring entertainers, is developing a TV series based on her life, releasing two albums -- including this summer's ''Pure & Simple,'' with new, original songs -- and celebrating 50 years of marriage with her husband, Carl Dean.\par \par \uc2 Her TV series, picking up on the 2015 NBC biopic ''Dolly Parton's Coat of Many Colors,'' will trace her childhood, from Pigeon Forge, Tenn., to Nashville. Ms. Parton helped create the show and chose the child actress Alyvia Alyn Lind to play her. ''That little thing can sing, and she's learned to play the guitar,'' Ms. Parton said. ''She's like Miley Cyrus as a child.''\par \par \uc2 Ms. Parton spoke by phone from a tour stop in Cincinnati, weighing in on the presidential \uc2 election\uc2  and a recent country music scandal. These are edited excerpts from the conversation.\par \par \uc2 ''Pure & Simple'' is an album of love songs. Did it have anything to do with being married for 50 years?\par \par \uc2 [Laughs] I thought it was a good time to write an album of just love songs. Most of them are positive. There's a couple of cheatin' type things, but you know, that's a type of love, too. If you're in love, you're in love. It doesn't matter. Love is love is love is love. Your heart can't help what it does.\par \par \uc2 Have you had a cheatin' heart?\par \par \uc2 Well, we've all got a cheatin' heart, it just depends on how we deal with it. Are you trying to put me in a corner? I said I was married; I didn't say I was dead!\par \par \uc2 Has your songwriting process changed?\par \par \uc2 I still use my little tape recorder, and I still write longhand. I can't think unless I've got a pen or a pencil in my hand, with a big old yellow legal pad. I think my writing is as good as it ever was. In some ways, I think it's better because I've lived longer and I've experienced more stuff. But when I write, I don't try to be commercial. I just write what I feel, and hope that it might turn out to be a ''Jolene'' or an ''I Will Always Love You.'' You can't really purposefully try to do that. If they're good, they're good, and if they're mediocre, they're mediocre. I got a lot of them, too.\par \par \uc2 Did you follow the Tomato-gate scandal, when a country radio consultant said that female artists should be played less, that men like Keith Urban were the staple and women were just the decoration?\par \par \uc2 [Lets out a long laugh-hoot] Oh, I didn't see that, but I don't agree, of course. Some of our greatest writers ever [are women], like Cindy Walker, Cynthia Weil -- you can just reel them off one after another -- Carole King. We're beautiful, too, but I think women are very smart, very talented and should have every right to express what talent God has given them. They should get their just dues.\par \par \uc2 How do you feel about a female presidential nominee?\par \par \uc2 Well, I think that that would be wonderful. Hillary might make as good a president as anybody ever has. I think no matter if it's Hillary or \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2 , we're gonna be plagued with PMS either way -- presidential mood swings! But I personally think a woman would do a great job. I think Hillary's very qualified. So if she gets it, I'll certainly be behind her.\par \par \uc2 How do you feel when people come to your shows dressed as you?\par \par \uc2 I think it's fun! You know, we usually have boys all dressed like me, and so when I do ''Jolene'' and I see a bunch of drag queens out there, I start singing [to the tune of the ''Jolene'' chorus] ''drag queen, drag queen, drag queen! Please don't take my man!'' [Laughing] I have a huge gay following, and I'm proud of them. Sometimes some of them look more like me than I do.\par \par \uc2 DOLLY PARTON (PHOTOGRAPH BY CTK MANAGEMENT/WEBSTER PUBLIC RELATIONS) \par \par \uc2 Document NYTF000020160703ec73000af\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 In an \uc2 election\uc2  season widely seen as stranger than fiction, we decided to turn to fiction to see how it might illuminate today's befuddling political climate. For the first time ever, the Book Review has commissioned an original short story. The assignment: Write anything about this \uc2 election\uc2  season you like. The result, Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie's ''The Arrangements,'' on our cover this week, updates Virginia Woolf's ''Mrs. Dalloway'' -- with Melania \uc2 Trump\uc2  as Clarissa.\par \par \uc2 In an email interview, Adichie, whose novel ''Americanah'' was one of the Book Review's 10 Best Books of 2013, said Woolf's novel ''both criticizes, and is also complicit in, a certain kind of conservative class-privileged England, and I like to think this story has the same general spirit.''\par \par \uc2 Adichie's interest began with Ivanka \uc2 Trump\uc2 , who ''seems to me too thoughtful and too intelligent to truly believe that her father's erratic, ungrounded policy positions would genuinely be good for the United States. And so I imagined her as a kind of unknowable character, and I needed a foil of sorts for her, which is how Melania \uc2 Trump\uc2  became the center of the story.''\par \par \uc2 ''Fiction can remind us -- and because of the blood-sport nature of politics, we constantly need reminding -- that the players in politics are first human beings,'' Adichie said.\par \par \uc2 Because we like to play fair, we've asked another writer for a story about the \uc2 Clinton\uc2  side of the \uc2 election\uc2 , which will appear in the Book Review this fall.\par \par \uc2 Quotable\par \par \uc2 ''Your manuscript is your confidante, it's your diary, it's your enemy -- it's all these things. It grows. And once it has a certain amount of weight and momentum, it colonizes your mind.'' -- Dan Vyleta, author of the novel ''Smoke,'' in an interview with Omnivoracious\par \par \uc2 A Yuge Inspiration\par \par \uc2 Adichie is far from the first writer to be inspired by the Donald, and this campaign season has brought a round of books that look at .\u226\'00\'E2\u8364\'20\'AC\u710\'02\'C6.\u226\'00\'E2\u8364\'20\'AC\u710\'02\'C6. the lighter side. ''Yuge!'' collects the cartoonist Garry Trudeau's ''Doonesbury'' strips about \uc2 Trump\uc2  from the past three decades. In his preface, Trudeau says that in 1980s New York, \uc2 Trump\uc2  ''had already become the gold standard for big, honking hubris, and to ignore him would have been comedy malpractice.'' In ''\uc2 Trump\uc2  and Me,'' the New Yorker staff writer Mark Singer revisits the period he spent writing a profile of \uc2 Trump\uc2  in 1996 and '97. One person who knew \uc2 Trump\uc2  told Singer: ''Deep down, he wants to be Madonna.''\par \par \uc2 A completely new piece of \uc2 Trump\uc2  literature comes from the comedian and author Michael Ian Black and the illustrator Marc Rosenthal, who have teamed up for ''A Child's First Book of \uc2 Trump\uc2 ,'' a Seussian picture book that attempts to explain the candidate. ''The beasty is called an American \uc2 Trump\uc2 ,'' one couplet goes. ''Its skin is bright orange, its figure is plump.''\par \par \uc2 DRAWING (DRAWING BY JOON MO KANG) \par \par \uc2 Document NYTF000020160703ec7300098\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 Book Review Desk; SECTBR\par \b \uc2 The Arrangements\b0\par\par\uc2 By CHIMAMANDA NGOZI ADICHIE \par \uc2 4,625 \uc2 words\par \uc2 3 July 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 1\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 The New York Times Book Review asked the acclaimed novelist Chima m anda Ngozi Adichie to write a short story about the American \uc2 election\uc2 . A second work of \uc2 election\uc2  fiction -- by a different writer -- will follow this fall.\par \par \uc2 Melania decided she would order the flowers herself. Donald was too busy now anyway to call Alessandra's as usual and ask for ''something amazing.'' Once, in the early years, before she fully understood him, she had asked what his favorite flowers were.\par \par \uc2 ''I use the best florists in the city, they're terrific,'' he replied, and she realized that taste, for him, was something to be determined by somebody else, and then flaunted.\par \par \uc2 At first, she wished he would not keep asking their guests, ''How do you like these great flowers?'' and that he would not be so nakedly in need of their praise, but now she felt a small tug of annoyance if a guest did not gush as Donald expected. The florists were indeed good, their peonies delicate as tissue, even if a little boring, and the interior decorators Donald had brought in -- all the top guys used them, he said -- were good, too, even if all that gold yellowness bordered on staleness, and so she did not disagree because Donald disliked dissent, and he only wanted the best for them, and she had what she really needed, this luxurious peace. But today, she would order herself. It was her dinner party to celebrate her parents' anniversary. Unusual orchids, maybe. Her mother loved uncommon things.\par \par \uc2 Her Pilates instructor, Janelle, would arrive in half an hour. She had just enough time to order the flowers and complete her morning skin routine. She would use a different florist, she decided, where Donald did not have an account, and pay by herself. Donald might like that; he always liked the small efforts she made. Do the little things, don't ask for big things and he will give them to you, her mother advised her, after she first met Donald. She gently patted three different serums on her face and then, with her fingertips, applied an eye cream and \u194\'00\'C2\u173\'00\'ADsunscreen.\par \par \uc2 What a bright morning. Summer sunlight raised her spirits. And Tiffany was leaving today. It felt good. The girl had been staying for the past week, and came and went, mostly staying out of her way. Still, it felt good. Yesterday she had taken Tiffany to lunch, so that she could tell Donald that she had taken Tiffany to lunch.\par \par \uc2 ''She adores all my kids, it's amazing,'' Donald once told a reporter -- he was happily blind to the strangeness in the air whenever she was with his children.\par \par \uc2 To keep the lunch short, she had told Tiffany that she had an afternoon meeting with the Chinese company that produced her jewelry -- even though she had no plans. Tiffany had cheerily forked spinach salad into her mouth, her California voice too pleasant, too fey. Her wrists looked fragile and breakable. She talked about how much she loved Ivanka's new collection; she talked about a vegan recipe, reciting details of berries and seaweed, as though Melania would actually ever make it. She played a recording of her singing and said: ''It's not there yet but I'm working on it. You think Dad will like it?'' Melania said, ''Of course.''\par \par \uc2 Now she found herself warming to Tiffany, perhaps more because the girl was leaving today. Tiffany was nice. Tiffany courted her. Tiffany acknowledged her power. Tiffany was different from that Czech woman's children -- she never disputed, with her manner, the primacy of Melania's place in Donald's life.\par \par \uc2 Not like Ivanka. Melania breathed deeply. Even just thinking of Ivanka brought an exquisite, slow-burning irritation. That letter Ivanka wrote to Donald after their engagement. She would never forget it. Congratulations, Dad. At least your ex-wife was pure. It lay carelessly on the desk, as most of Donald's papers did, and Melania had read it over and over, and later, unable to control herself, had shown it to Donald. What does she mean by this? Donald laughed it off. Ivanka gets moody and jealous, he said. I am here! Melania had wanted to shout once at the girl, golden-haired and indulged by Donald, one summer when Ivanka joined them for breakfast in Palm Beach and did not once glance at Melania.\par \par \uc2 ''Melania looks great, but we have to think about how to make her more relatable for the convention, maybe less contour makeup and her smiling and not squinting so much,'' Ivanka said just two days earlier, at a meeting with Donald's campaign team. Melania was seated there, next to Donald and part of the meeting, and yet Ivanka spoke of her as though she were invisible.\par \par \uc2 ''Yes, that's a good idea,'' Donald said. He always agreed with Ivanka. Ivanka who spoke in eloquent streams of words that meant nothing but still impressed everyone, Ivanka whom Donald showed off like a glowing modern toy that he did not know how to operate.\par \par \uc2 Remember, only praise for his daughter when he is there, her mother told her whenever Melania complained.\par \par \uc2 Her phone chimed; a text from Donald. I'm leading in the latest poll. National! Nice!\par \par \uc2 It was probably what he had tweeted as well. He copied and pasted his tweets to her in text messages. Once she had suggested he hold back on a tweet and he replied that he had already tweeted it. He showed her his tweets after he had sent them, not before.\par \par \uc2 That is so great! she texted back.\par \par \uc2 She sagged suddenly with terror, imagining what would happen if Donald actually won. Everything would change. Her contentment would crack into pieces. The relentless intrusions into their lives; those horrible media people who never gave Donald any credit would get even worse. She had never questioned Donald's dreams because they did not collide with her need for peace. Only once, when he was angry about something to do with his TV show, and abruptly decided to leave her and Barron in Paris and go back to New York, she had asked him quietly, ''When will it be enough?'' She had been rubbing her caviar cream on Barron's cheeks -- he was about 6 then -- and Donald ignored her question and said, ''Keep doing that and you'll turn that kid into a sissy.''\par \par \uc2 She forced herself to stop thinking of Donald winning. There was this evening to look forward to, with Donald and her parents and a few friends, food and flowers, the butler's creaseless service, and the magnanimous ease of it all.\par \par \uc2 Barron had told her last night that he would not join them at dinner. ''Too boring, Mom,'' he had said in Slovenian. She missed his delicious younger days, when he was pliable and happy to go everywhere with her, when she would brush his hair and hold his perfect little body close and feel it almost one with hers. Now, he had an individual self, separate and wise, with knowledge of golf and video games; when she kissed him he twisted away. At least she had persuaded him to come down and say hello to the guests after they arrived.\par \par \uc2 She had asked the chef for a menu that was both ''old and new,'' and he suggested steak and watercress and quinoa and lobster and something else she did not remember. Her mother would like it. When she was growing up, her mother used the French or English terms for the food she cooked, as if the Slovenian would make them unforgivingly ordinary. She would serve a ragout for dinner, after a long day at the textile factory, her lips still carefully rouged, her waist tightly cinched, always striving, always trying to escape the familiar. A woman had to hold herself together, her mother said, or end up looking like a wide middle-aged Russian.\par \par \uc2 \u226\'00\'E2\u8212\'20\'14\u8224\'20\'20\par \par \uc2 The butler called her bedroom. ''Miss Tiffany would like to say goodbye, Mrs. \uc2 Trump\uc2 .''\par \par \uc2 ''Yes, thank you,'' Melania said, and waited for Tiffany to knock on her door.\par \par \uc2 ''I'm so sorry, didn't want to bother you,'' Tiffany said. Her blond hair extensions were distracting; too long and doll-like.\par \par \uc2 ''No, no problem,'' Melania said. ''You look nice.''\par \par \uc2 ''Thank you so much for everything! See you in Cleveland next week!'' Tiffany said, hugging her.\par \par \uc2 ''Take care.''\par \par \uc2 At the door, Tiffany turned back and said, ''Ivanka donates to Hillary.''\par \par \uc2 ''What?''\par \par \uc2 ''I saw it on her laptop when I went over there last night. She uses a fake name. It's the same fake name she uses to order stuff online. I thought you should know.''\par \par \uc2 Melania swallowed her surprise. Why was Tiffany telling her this? Around Ivanka, Tiffany was like an eager insecure puppy, as though she would not truly be part of the family but for Ivanka's good grace -- a grace that needed to be fed with loyalty and adulation.\par \par \uc2 So why tell her this? And could it be true? Tiffany was watching, waiting for a reaction. She was determined to say nothing, just in case Tiffany was reporting back to someone. She always suspected intrigue among Donald's children -- and she would not tell Donald about this, not yet; she would first discuss it with her mother. Whether it was true or not, this was a morsel to be saved, molded, used in the best way.\par \par \uc2 ''I must get ready for my Pilates, Tiffany,'' she said firmly. ''See you in Cleveland.''\par \par \uc2 Donald called just after she ordered the orchids. He had some meetings, but his big event of the day was a luncheon organized by the \uc2 Republican National Committee\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 ''How is it going?'' she asked.\par \par \uc2 ''Great. Did you see the polls, honey? Can you believe this?'' His voice had an ebullient pitch. He still did not entirely believe this was happening -- his lead in the polls, the new veneer of being taken seriously. She could tell from the disbelieving urgency of his actions, and from the way he flipped through cable channels and scanned newspapers for his name.\par \par \uc2 ''Remember I told you: You will win,'' she said.\par \par \uc2 She always tried to sound casually believing, as if the polls were merely incidental, and her faith had conjured his victory. But she was as startled by his rise as he was.\par \par \uc2 When she had first told him ''you will win,'' that balmy day in Florida last year, drinking Diet Coke in tennis whites, she had meant he would win at what he wanted: the publicity, the ego polish. It would help his TV show, and impress those business associates tickled by fame. But she had never meant he would actually win the Republican primary, nor had she expected the frenzy of media coverage he received. Americans were so emotionally young, so fascinated by what Europeans knew to be world-weary realities. They were drawn to Donald's brashness and bluster and bullying, his harsh words, even the amoral ease with which untruths slid out of his mouth. She viewed these with a shrug -- he was human, and he had his good points, and did Americans truly not know that human beings told lies? But they had followed him from the beginning, breathlessly and childishly. There were days when every television channel she switched to had his image on the screen. They did not understand that what he found unbearable was to be ignored, and for this she was grateful, because being in the news brought Donald the closest he could be to contentment. He would never be a truly content person, she knew this, because of that primal restlessness that thrummed in him, the compulsion to prove something to himself that he feared he never would. It moved her, made her feel protective. Even the way he nursed his grudges, almost lovingly, unleashing in great detail slights from 20 years ago, made her protective of him. She often felt, despite the age gap of more than two decades, that she was older than Donald. Her response to his agitations was a curated series of soothing murmurs. Be a little calmer, she told him often. In bed, she had learned to gauge Donald and know when he expected her to gasp. On nights when she did not have the mental energy to act, she would tell Donald, ''It is not a good night today,'' and he would kiss her cheek and leave, because he liked her air of delicate mystery.\par \par \uc2 \u226\'00\'E2\u8212\'20\'14\u8224\'20\'20\par \par \uc2 The butler knocked and brought her lemon water on a tray. ''Janelle is here, Mrs. \uc2 Trump\uc2 .''\par \par \uc2 He did his characteristic almost-bow. He liked her, mostly because of how little she said, and how she encouraged an air of enigmatic formality.\par \par \uc2 ''Thank you,'' she said.\par \par \uc2 She applied concealer and lip gloss and highlighter, checked herself in the mirror. She had not worn makeup with Amy, her last instructor, but Janelle made her want to look attractive. After Amy moved to Los Angeles and recommended Janelle, Donald saw her -- he was home on Janelle's first day and said: ''Really? I didn't think they did that Pilates stuff. It's not like Pilates is hip-hop or whatever.'' She, too, was taken aback when she first saw Janelle, sinuous and small, skin the color of earth, locs pulled up in a bun. She's professional and discreet, Amy had said. Now, weeks in, Melania wished that Janelle were not so professional, so singularly focused on straightening Melania's feet, flattening Melania's belly, and never saying anything personal.\par \par \uc2 ''Hi, Mrs. \uc2 Trump\uc2 . Ready for the warm-up?'' Janelle asked, her face, as usual, a pleasant mask scrubbed of expression.\par \par \uc2 ''Yes,'' Melania said.\par \par \uc2 Janelle was beside her on the mat, legs aloft. She smelled of grapefruit. Melania wanted to reach out and taste her -- the smooth skin of her arm, her full, \u194\'00\'C2\u173\'00\'ADbrownish-pink lips. She followed Janelle's lead and wondered about Janelle's life. Was there a boyfriend? Someone like her, dignified and quiet? Each time the Pilates session ended, she considered asking Janelle to stay for lunch, or just a glass of juice, but she feared that Janelle would say no.\par \par \uc2 ''Oh, I must get a massage, for my thighs,'' Melania said, tentative, desperate to say something personal and yet safe.\par \par \uc2 ''A warm bath should help,'' Janelle said. ''Have a good day, Mrs. \uc2 Trump\uc2 .''\par \par \uc2 Melania felt deflated. Had she expected Janelle to offer to give her a massage? It was so silly of her. Had Janelle meant anything more by ''warm bath''? She was trying to read what was not there. But she would not allow herself to be sad. There was the evening to look forward to.\par \par \uc2 \u226\'00\'E2\u8212\'20\'14\u8224\'20\'20\par \par \uc2 Her phone chimed. Another text from Donald.\par \par \uc2 Hope says fashion people are asking what you'll wear to convention. Has to be a big name. An American designer. Have you decided?\par \par \uc2 I have three and will choose tomorrow, she texted back.\par \par \uc2 Donald had never taken much interest in what she wore. Not like Tomaz, her ex, who had picked out her clothes and liked the smell of her sweat. Why had she suddenly thought of Tomaz? Tomaz smoked thin cigarettes and walked the world in an existential haze of disapproval. After she was interviewed in a French magazine some years ago, Tomaz had sent her an email through her sister Ines. Now you have what you always wanted, you have forgotten Ljubljana? It had annoyed her and of course she did not reply. Unlike Tomaz, Donald was not a sensual man. But it was what had attracted her to Donald in the beginning: He was not a man who traded in complexities. After brooding, Sartre-quoting Tomaz, Donald came as a relief.\par \par \uc2 She checked the time. Donald would be done with his luncheon. She would call, to remind him to be back on time. He sometimes forgot himself at these things.\par \par \uc2 ''The dinner party?'' he said. ''Of course I'll be home.''\par \par \uc2 ''You want me to wear those first diamonds?'' she asked, light and teasing. It was their joke; the first time they made love, she had worn nothing but those earrings. It had also been his first gift to her, in a pretty black box, and he asked her to open it, humming with a need for her gratitude. He was not eager to please her, she realized, he was keen to be pleased by her pleasure. And so she gave in, thanking him, wreathing her face with delight, even though she wished the diamonds were bigger.\par \par \uc2 ''Yes, wear them. I bet those beauties have tripled in value,'' he said. ''I have to go, honey, I'm meeting with the top five guys of the committee. They're all dying to talk to me.''\par \par \uc2 She undressed and examined herself in the mirror. There was a new dimple in her thigh. Donald would say something if he noticed it. ''You need to get these fixed soon,'' he had said a few months back, cupping her breasts, and when he got up from bed, she looked at his pale, slack belly, and the sprinkle of bristly hair on his back.\par \par \uc2 \u226\'00\'E2\u8212\'20\'14\u8224\'20\'20\par \par \uc2 In the bath, sunk into scented foam, Melania settled down to read the latest coverage of Donald. There was a story about his money; they kept saying he did not have as much as he claimed to have. What did it matter? He had a lot. She glanced at the comments at the end of the article and the name ''Janelle'' caught her eye. The commenter wrote: \uc2 Trump\uc2  needs to modernize those ill-fitting suits, throw away the bottle of orange tan, get fake teeth that actually look like teeth and let himself go bald like God intended. How many Janelles were there in America? Of course it could not be her Janelle. Still, seeing the name excited her. It was unfair that people made fun of Donald's hair but she could not help smiling, reading it, imagining her Janelle writing it.\par \par \uc2 There was a story about some of his angry supporters, displaying swastikas on their trucks, and she cringed reading it. Extremes of anything discomfited her. The day Donald announced he would run for president, she had been filled with light on their glorious descent in the escalator, eyes and cameras on them, and everything dazzling. Afterward, she escaped to the cool white of her bedroom, and lay still for a long time, and then looked online at the coverage. She loved the way her smoky eyes popped in the photographs. A heady sense of accomplishment suffused her. But she did not want too many more of those moments, because they shifted her balance, left her spirit vaguely disjointed.\par \par \uc2 She Googled herself and enlarged some of the photos. Why did some news sites choose the most unflattering images? It was deliberate. She was scrupulous about presenting the best angles of her face to the cameras, practicing the tilt to her neck that ensured a slim silhouette. Yet some photo editors were determined to use the few bad shots. They were jealous of Donald; nothing else could explain it.\par \par \uc2 She hoped Donald would not open her bedroom door tonight; this was the kind of day that he would come, exuberant and expansive from victory. It had been almost two months. The last time, he kissed her, eager and dramatic and sweaty as he often was -- he hated her initiating things, ''aggressive women make me think I'm with a transsexual,'' he'd told her years ago -- and then fumbled and shifted and suddenly got up and said he had a phone call to make. Only then did she understand what had happened. They did not talk about it, but for a few days he had sulked and snapped, as though it were her fault.\par \par \uc2 \u226\'00\'E2\u8212\'20\'14\u8224\'20\'20\par \par \uc2 Donald came home red-faced, his lips a snarl of rage. He ignored the butler's greeting. Melania kissed him hello and braced herself.\par \par \uc2 ''Can you believe these losers? They're talking about 2020,'' he said. He flung his jacket down on the living room floor and she picked it up.\par \par \uc2 ''What happened?'' she asked.\par \par \uc2 ''Reince pulled me aside after the meeting. He's a great guy, always nice to me. He said all the top guys at the R.N.C. have decided to focus on 2020, and put very little money and effort into my campaign. Like I don't even have a chance at all!''\par \par \uc2 ''It makes no sense what they want to do. You have many votes. Look at the polls. People love you.''\par \par \uc2 She knew how easily mollified he was by praise, but he barely seemed to hear her, consumed as he was, typing furiously on his phone. She hoped he would not hurl the phone at the wall, as he had done after a newspaper wrote about \uc2 Trump\uc2  University, after which he stayed up all night writing hasty, flagrant letters to journalists.\par \par \uc2 The doorbell rang and there was Ivanka, her face dewy as though she had not had a long day at work, lips crimson. Too crimson; Melania herself favored nude lipsticks. She imagined Ivanka sending money to \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's campaign, using a fake name. Could it be true? What name did she use? Thinking of a fake name made her think of Janelle.\par \par \uc2 ''Hey!'' Ivanka said. A general greeting, but she was looking at her father.\par \par \uc2 ''Ivanka. What a surprise,'' Melania said.\par \par \uc2 ''Ivanka wanted to come over to discuss this,'' Donald said, glancing up from his phone. He was only telling her now. He would expect her to ask Ivanka to dinner and she would have to endure Ivanka's polished voice, that fulsome surface that shielded cold metal.\par \par \uc2 ''Oh, what gorgeous flowers,'' Ivanka said. ''Are they from Alessandra's, Dad?''\par \par \uc2 ''No. I used another florist,'' Melania said. Ivanka's admiration pleased her, and she resented Ivanka for it.\par \par \uc2 ''Can you just believe these losers?'' Donald said testily, impatient with talk of flowers. ''They want to sabotage me!''\par \par \uc2 Donald admired in his daughter qualities he would not abide in a wife. Not that Melania minded, she told herself, watching them. Ivanka moved like him, loose-limbed. Like him, she was comfortable with display. Like him, she was always selling something. The difference was that you knew what Donald was selling; Ivanka left you wondering.\par \par \uc2 ''It's utter sabotage and unacceptable,'' Ivanka said.\par \par \uc2 ''I've got to hit back at these guys.''\par \par \uc2 ''You do have to hit back, totally,'' Ivanka said. ''We have to figure out the best way.''\par \par \uc2 Why did she not calm him down? Melania was annoyed. Her evening would be ruined, Donald's churlish mood would darken her dinner, and he would probably leave after the main course, without apology. He had done it the day after Cruz beat him at a primary, and they had been with guests that he had invited.\par \par \uc2 ''I'm leaving the Republican Party. That's it. If they're going to treat me this way. It's not nice. That's it,'' Donald said.\par \par \uc2 ''But you need the party,'' Melania said.\par \par \uc2 ''This isn't Europe, honey. You don't know anything about this,'' Donald said and turned back to Ivanka.\par \par \uc2 She would not be annoyed, not with Ivanka to witness it. Donald used ''Europe'' to belittle her sometimes, but he also used ''European'' as Americans did, like an aspirational word. European chocolates. European bread. European style.\par \par \uc2 ''Can we set up a three-way with Paul and Hope in the study, Dad?'' Ivanka said, looking amused. ''Is Barron in his room? I'll just go say a quick hi.''\par \par \uc2 Melania felt an unreasonable urge to get up and drag Ivanka back. You do not go to my son's room without my permission!\par \par \uc2 If only Barron didn't like her. It was Ivanka with whom he discussed tennis and golf.\par \par \uc2 ''Look, honey, can we do this dinner another time?'' Donald said after Ivanka left. ''I need to think about this. These losers can't do this to me. Your parents will be fine. They're here most of the time anyway, and I can fly them back in if they want to. .\u226\'00\'E2\u8364\'20\'AC\u710\'02\'C6.\u226\'00\'E2\u8364\'20\'AC\u710\'02\'C6.''\par \par \uc2 He was still speaking, but she could no longer understand. A tightness had gripped her temples, her hands shook. ''Donald, I want this,'' she said. ''We have not hosted my parents. It is 50 years of marriage for them. Their friends are coming. I have planned for one week. I want this today.''\par \par \uc2 Donald looked up astonished from his phone. She dug her nails in her palm and stared back at him.\par \par \uc2 ''O.K., O.K.,'' Donald said sighing. ''Just give me some time to talk to Ivanka.''\par \par \uc2 He went inside, and a new elation settled in Melania's bones.\par \par \uc2 They emerged half an hour later, Donald's face relaxed, Ivanka laughing, pushing her hair away from her face, fondly indulgent of her beloved man-child father.\par \par \uc2 ''We can't keep letting them think you're going to be Caligula when you become president, Dad,'' Ivanka said.\par \par \uc2 ''Whatever,'' Donald said with a grin. He turned to Melania. ''Honey, we have a plan. I announce two days before the convention that I'm done with the party. My supporters don't care about the party anyway. It's \uc2 Trump\uc2  they want. If I'm an independent they'll still come to me. So that leaves the R.N.C. with one day to try and fix things. I'll give them a list of my conditions, they need to show me plans and figures for how they'll support my campaign, otherwise no deal. It'll knock them down. Let's see what they do with that!'' He sounded gleeful.\par \par \uc2 Melania was startled. How could Ivanka have agreed to this? It would only lose him votes. His supporters were already with him, but what about the people who would vote for him only because of the Republican Party? Would that not turn them off? She opened her mouth to say something and then closed it. Ivanka had the smallest of triumphant smiles on her face. A well-oiled smile. Melania remembered that smooth smile at other times, when Donald insulted \uc2 John McCain\uc2 , when Donald boycotted a Republican debate. Ivanka always egged him on, never dissuaded him; she stirred the pot with her fulsome words.\par \par \uc2 But Donald was calmer and her evening would go well and her mother would be happy.\par \par \uc2 After dinner, she would ask Donald to come to her room, and she would be soft and subtle, and wear the jasmine scent he liked, and tell him Tiffany had come to her this morning, upset and crying, because she had discovered that Ivanka was supporting \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 . She would suggest that Donald do and say nothing about it, hopefully none of the dishonest media people would find out, because of course it would be terrible if he had to publicly denounce his daughter, and Ivanka was so wonderful really, even though she was always telling the press how she didn't agree with all of her father's policies.\par \par \uc2 ''Ivanka, will you join us for dinner?'' Melania asked, knowing Ivanka would decline.\par \par \uc2 ''Thanks, but I have to get back to the kids,'' Ivanka said.\par \par \uc2 Melania smiled sagely. ''Of course. Say hello to the family.''\par \par \uc2 The doorbell rang. Her guests had arrived.\par \par \uc2 This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.\par \par \uc2 Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie is the author of three novels, most recently ''Americanah.''\par \par \uc2 DRAWINGS (DRAWINGS BY JOHN CUNEO) (BR1; BR14; BR15; BR16) \par \par \uc2 Document NYTF000020160703ec7300095\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 With only this scene to go on, someone might have concluded that President Richard Nixon was the idol of young voters and African-Americans, which was just the intention of his handlers.\par \par \uc2 It was the night of Tuesday, Aug. 22, 1972. Strolling about the stage at the outdoor Miami Marine Stadium, Sammy Davis Jr., was warbling his own slightly hipper version of the president's newly unveiled campaign anthem (''Now more than ever, baby, Nixon now!'').\par \par \uc2 After a long dry spell, Davis had just returned almost to the top of the charts with his anodyne song ''The Candy Man'' (which he detested) and, despite his history as a Kennedy Democrat, this Rat Pack alumnus had come out for Nixon. Behind Davis were young people with Afros and wearing bell-bottoms, there to remind TV viewers that it was Nixon who had prodded Congress to stop the military draft and lower the voting age to 18.\par \par \uc2 Republican delegates in Miami Beach had just nominated Nixon for a second term. Striding into view, Nixon pulled out a camera, awkwardly pretending to photograph Davis as he sang. ''I don't think the youth vote is in anybody's pocket,'' Nixon told the crowd. Then, noting Davis's Democratic lineage, the president insisted that no one could ''buy'' Davis's support with a White House invitation, adding, ''You are going to buy him by doing something for America!'' Davis startled the president by hugging him.\par \par \uc2 This month, operatives for Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2  and \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  have said they will try to mold each of their conventions into something of an infomercial for each of their candidates. For most of American history, this would have been impossible, because usually nominees were not anointed until the delegates met, often after many ballots. But in modern times, with nominations so often locked up in advance, campaigns would be foolish not to try to turn those days of exposure into a major marketing opportunity.\par \par \uc2 The first to do this with serious forethought was Nixon's now infamous Committee to Re-elect the President, in 1972. During the convention's planning, the committee was led by Nixon's former attorney general, John Mitchell, and featured marketing recruits like the 37-year-old Jeb Stuart Magruder, once of Jewel Food Stores.\par \par \uc2 Also on the team was H. R. Haldeman, the White House chief of staff. Haldeman had formerly worked at the \uc2 J. Walter Thompson\uc2  advertising agency in Los Angeles, where he was known for his deft touch with customers deemed ''horror clients,'' like \uc2 Walt Disney\uc2 . After the Miami youth rally, Haldeman wrote in his diary that Nixon had ''handled it perfectly'' and ''I think we scored maybe the major coup of the week.''\par \par \uc2 In public, Nixon professed to care only about substance, but in private, he often micromanaged his future appearances. Before the Wednesday evening acceptance speech, Haldeman told his journal that Nixon ''wants to do his makeup in the trailer'' and didn't want his family mingling onstage with that of Vice President Spiro Agnew, whom he disdained. In a June conversation that he taped, Nixon had warned his chief of staff that his wife, Pat, and their daughters should not take a helicopter to the convention hall because ''it destroys their hair.''\par \par \uc2 The 1972 Republican convention was the first to make major use of the first lady, whom the president that week lauded as ''the best campaigner in the Nixon family.'' Introduced by the actor Jimmy Stewart and California's governor, Ronald Reagan (wearing a white suit), Mrs. Nixon took the rostrum (which had been created by the set designer for the television show ''The Dating Game'') and charmingly used her slender arms to swing an enormous wooden gavel. She pronounced her long audience ovation (complete with mass-produced signs saying, ''We love Pat'') ''the most wonderful welcome I've ever had'' and reproached ''those who say that we don't have young people'' supporting her husband.\par \par \uc2 Nixon's campaign was the first to give prominence to biographical films, which have since become a mainstay of conventions. ''Nixon the Man,'' produced by the documentarian David Wolper, was narrated by the basso-voiced Richard Basehart, star of the TV science fiction show ''Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea.'' In the film, Basehart professed to reveal ''the private man, at work and in his relaxed moments ... a man of compassion, courage and conscience,'' who urged the nation to ''walk without fear.'' With his mid-Atlantic accent, Basehart closed portentously, ''And America will hear him!'' Other films that week showcased Mrs. Nixon and Mamie and Dwight Eisenhower.\par \par \uc2 Nixon's well-scrubbed, carefully staged convention was a contrast to that of Senator George McGovern of South Dakota, held the previous month in the same Miami Beach hall -- as different as Up With People was from Led Zeppelin. From the Republican stage, Governor Reagan joked that there had been ''smoke-filled rooms'' at McGovern's convention, but that ''the smoke smelled a little funny.''\par \par \uc2 Reality was not entirely excluded from this scene. As shown in the 1989 film based on Ron Kovic's memoir ''Born on the Fourth of July,'' starring Tom Cruise, the Vietnam veteran made his way into the hall with comrades to remind delegates, in protest, that the Southeast Asian conflict was still raging.\par \par \uc2 Over all, though, James Reston of The \uc2 New York Times\uc2  marveled that week -- with a sense of surprise that would be unimaginable nowadays -- that Republicans had ''controlled this gathering here like a TV show'' and called Nixon's convention ''a model of how to use modern political and advertising techniques to win an \uc2 election\uc2 .''\par \par \uc2 But behind the facade were some of the makings of the Watergate scandal, including the Nixon campaign's secret Operation Gemstone, which envisioned kidnapping, wiretapping, and using prostitutes and additional plots to discredit the Democratic opposition and keep ''radicals'' and other Nixon critics from disrupting the proceedings. The convention's financing also caught the eye of federal prosecutors, who later found evidence of secret slush funds, money laundering and quid pro quos.\par \par \uc2 By the time Nixon left Miami Beach, although he was headed for a landslide, his best days as president were already behind him. During that conversation of June 1972 in which he worried about the impact of helicopters on his wife's hair, he also ordered Haldeman to obstruct an investigation of that week's break-in at the Democrats' Watergate headquarters. Ultimately his recording of this exchange became known as the ''smoking gun'' tape.\par \par \uc2 Almost two years after that night with Sammy Davis, that recording helped force Richard Nixon to resign his presidency and send Haldeman and Mitchell to prison.\par \par \uc2 MICHAEL BESCHLOSS, a presidential historian, is the author of nine books.\par \par \uc2 The entertainer Sammy Davis Jr. introducing President Richard Nixon during the 1972 Republican convention in Miami Beach. The backdrop of young people was intended to remind viewers that Nixon had prodded Congress to stop the military draft and lower the voting age to 18.

\par\par \uc2 National Desk; SECTA\par \b \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's Climate Change Plan Avoids Mention of Carbon Tax\b0\par\par\uc2 By CORAL DAVENPORT \par \uc2 1,340 \uc2 words\par \uc2 3 July 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 15\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 WASHINGTON -- \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , courting young voters and the broader Democratic base, has promised to one-up President Obama on climate change, vowing to produce a third of the nation's electricity from renewable sources by 2027, three years faster than Mr. Obama, while spending billions of dollars to transform the energy economy.\par \par \uc2 A half-billion solar panels will be installed by 2020, she has promised, seven times the number today, and $60 billion will go to states and cities to develop more climate-friendly infrastructure, such as public transportation and energy-efficient buildings. She would put the United States on track to reduce greenhouse gas emissions 80 percent from 2005 levels by 2050. And, she says, she could achieve all that without new legislation from Congress.\par \par \uc2 But Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  has avoided mention of the one policy that economists widely see as the most effective way to tackle climate change -- and one that would need Congress's assent: putting a price or tax on carbon dioxide emissions.\par \par \uc2 ''It's possible, theoretically, to do all this without a price on carbon,'' said David Victor, the director of the Laboratory on International Law and Regulation at the \uc2 University of California, San Diego\uc2 . But, he added, ''it's hard to see how.''\par \par \uc2 ''The problem is,'' he said, ''she knows the politics of this are toxic.''\par \par \uc2 John Podesta\uc2 , a former senior counselor to Mr. Obama who is now the chairman of Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's campaign, is an architect of both the Obama and \uc2 Clinton\uc2  climate change plans. In crafting them, Mr. Podesta, an ardent environmentalist and a seasoned political operative, sought to take substantive action to reduce emissions without turning to Congress, where climate legislation would most likely again be doomed.\par \par \uc2 ''Secretary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  believes that meeting the climate challenge is too important to wait for climate deniers in Congress to pass comprehensive climate legislation,'' Mr. Podesta wrote in an emailed statement.\par \par \uc2 While Mr. Podesta's climate plan for Mr. Obama centered on using the Clean Air Act to write new regulations to limit emissions from vehicles and power plants, a \uc2 Clinton\uc2  administration could return to the same law to issue rules on emissions from other slices of the economy, including the airline industry, oil refineries, gas production wells and cement manufacturers.\par \par \uc2 In that way, Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  could walk a difficult line. Her ambitious climate change goals should appeal to young and progressive voters, particularly supporters of Senator Bernie Sanders, who has called for a carbon tax. But by avoiding mention of such a tax, she hopes to avoid Republican attacks on a proposal that would raise gasoline and electricity bills.\par \par \uc2 ''In an ideal world, the negative externalities would have a price on them,'' said Scott Hennessey, the vice president of policy at the solar power company \uc2 SolarCity\uc2 , using an economics term for pollution. ''But we know it's not politically realistic. And we need to be realistic about what we can get.''\par \par \uc2 Economists have noted that by driving up the cost of fossil fuels, a carbon price is intended to push the market toward cleaner sources of energy, such as wind and solar. In the long run, that could make those energy sources cheap and widespread. But in the short run, it could drive up the cost of filling tanks with gasoline and electricity generated by coal and gas -- a nonstarter for many voters.\par \par \uc2 Veterans of the Obama administration are still smarting from the president's failed first-term effort to cap carbon emissions and to force carbon-emitting companies to purchase or trade for permits for every ton of carbon dioxide released. That ''cap-and-trade'' plan died in Congress in 2010, and contributed to Democrats' loss of the House majority that year.\par \par \uc2 ''A lot of the people who cast those votes in the House ended up paying a big price in the 2010 \uc2 election\uc2 ,'' said David Axelrod, the former senior political adviser on Mr. Obama's campaigns and in the White House. ''If I'm in her campaign, I don't want to hand a cudgel to the other side.''\par \par \uc2 Conservative campaign operatives agree that they would immediately pounce on any mention by Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  of a carbon price.\par \par \uc2 ''\uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  surely knows the political peril of directly telling American families that she wants to tax their gasoline,'' said Tim Phillips, the president of Americans for Prosperity, the conservative group backed by the billionaires Charles G. and \uc2 David H. Koch\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Since the political fallout from 2010, Mr. Obama has sought to circumvent Congress on climate change. He used his executive authority to release Clean Air Act regulations on vehicles and power plants, the nation's two largest sources of carbon pollution.\par \par \uc2 Under the Paris Agreement, an accord committing nearly 200 countries to lowering carbon emissions, Mr. Obama pledged to reduce the United States' emissions 25 percent to 28 percent from 2005 levels by 2025, and 80 percent by 2050.\par \par \uc2 Experts say that under a combination of Mr. Obama's policies and a handful of new policies that would not require Congressional action, it would be possible to reach the 2025 Paris target, but not the 2050 target. Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  has pledged that her policies would put the nation on a path to meeting that 2050 target.\par \par \uc2 ''The overwhelming view of the people who have looked at this is that there's no way to get to the 2050 goal, and probably the near-term goal, without a carbon price,'' said \uc2 Jessica Tuchman Mathews\uc2 , a former president of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. ''At the very least, it would be like attempting to climb a very steep mountain with one leg tied behind your back.''\par \par \uc2 Absent a carbon price, Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  plans to use a mix of new regulations, grant programs and spending on new infrastructure to achieve her targets. She would also spend $30 billion on a plan to help redevelop coal mining communities that are suffering economically in the wake of climate change policies.\par \par \uc2 But experts say that such a piecemeal approach, while it would feasibly reduce emissions, would probably be less efficient and more expensive than the imposition of a single carbon price. It would also probably reach a point of diminishing returns because the Obama regulations have already affected the two most polluting industries.\par \par \uc2 ''She can continue to put out more rules,'' Mr. Victor said. ''But the Obama administration showed us the high-water mark for what is possible on climate change with executive authority.''\par \par \uc2 And Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  would need at least some action by Congress to meet her goals -- legislators would need to appropriate the $60 billion she intends to spend on clean infrastructure grants to states, and the $30 billion to help coal communities.\par \par \uc2 Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's advisers say she is confident that Congress would appropriate the money because it would be funneled directly to states. Experts are skeptical.\par \par \uc2 ''It's hard to see how she gets this kind of money from a public budget,'' Mr. Victor said.\par \par \uc2 Among environmental groups and the renewable energy industry, however, there is support for Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's proposals, however difficult they might be, compared with those of the presumptive Republican presidential nominee \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , who denies the established science of human-caused climate change.\par \par \uc2 Even economists are sounding like realists.\par \par \uc2 ''The clearest and most obvious way to reach the climate targets is with a nationwide carbon pricing method, whether a carbon tax or a cap and trade,'' said Robert Stavins, the head of the environmental economics program at \uc2 Harvard University\uc2 . ''But it's not surprising, given the politics, that Secretary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  would not want to explicitly talk about carbon pricing.''\par \par \uc2 Find out what you need to know about the 2016 presidential race today, and get politics news updates via \uc2 Facebook\uc2 , \uc2 Twitter\uc2  and the First Draft newsletter.\par \par \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  has promised to have a half-billion solar panels installed by 2020, seven times the number today.

\par\par \uc2 OP-ED COLUMNIST\par \uc2 Editorial Desk; SECTSR\par \b \uc2 The Utter Inconsequence of Hillary's Veep\b0\par\par\uc2 By FRANK BRUNI \par \uc2 1,215 \uc2 words\par \uc2 3 July 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 3\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 I DOUBT that \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  really wants to run with Elizabeth Warren -- I doubt that she fully trusts her -- but if that's her calculated decision: mazel tov. They sure were fiery together last week, two blue devils raring to bedevil \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Tim Kaine is totally sensible, mostly safe and a bit of a snooze: the aspirin of aspirants. But if \uc2 Clinton\uc2  is tugged in the Virginia senator's direction, she should head there. I could certainly see him as the vice president.\par \par \uc2 Then again I've seen Julia Louis-Dreyfus in the job, in HBO's ''Veep.'' \uc2 Clinton\uc2  might as well pick her for all the difference it would make.\par \par \uc2 Here's what we journalists don't like to tell you or even admit to ourselves as we furiously stir the speculation, breathlessly thicken the suspense and whet Americans' appetites for the big reveal of who will round out the Democratic and Republican tickets: Its impact on the \uc2 election\uc2  is close to nonexistent.\par \par \uc2 That's particularly true this time around, and especially so with \uc2 Clinton\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 She can veer to the left, tack to the center, go for sizzle, settle for steadiness. She has all the wiggle room in the world. Seldom in a modern presidential campaign has the selection of a running mate mattered as little as it does for her.\par \par \uc2 She has been on Americans' TV screens and in their brains for so long now that she's like email or A.T.M.s: It's hard to remember daily life before her. Opinions of her are fixed. Emotions are ossified. Her running mate won't be some fresh lens through which voters notice new shadings and dimensions of her. There's no sudden swoon for her around the bend, no fresh disenchantment in the offing.\par \par \uc2 She has no gaping holes in her r\u233\'00\'E9sum\u233\'00\'E9 to fill. ''By any measure, \uc2 Clinton\uc2  has every credential needed to be president,'' said Stephanie Cutter, a Democratic political consultant who was the deputy manager of President Obama's 2012 re-\uc2 election\uc2  effort. ''So a vice president isn't going to add to that.''\par \par \uc2 And there are strong signs in recent surveys that the progressives who supported Bernie Sanders are coming around to her even before they find out which partner she teams with. These polls suggest that Democratic voters are happier with her than Republican voters are with \uc2 Trump\uc2 ; that many more Sanders supporters view her positively than negatively; and that more than three in four of them are already behind her.\par \par \uc2 So for all of the excited talk last week about \uc2 Clinton\uc2  and Warren, Warren probably isn't necessary for \uc2 Clinton\uc2  -- and could be a nuisance in any \uc2 Clinton\uc2  White House.\par \par \uc2 ''Every bit of evidence about Elizabeth Warren is that she'll go indie when she feels she needs to,'' said Doug Schoen, a pollster and strategist who has advised \uc2 Bill \uc2 Clinton\uc2  and \uc2 Mike Bloomberg\uc2 , referring to Warren's carefully maintained identity as someone who doesn't back down. If \uc2 Clinton\uc2  ran with her and won, ''The day that Warren says, 'I cannot support this trade deal' that \uc2 Clinton\uc2  has decided to endorse, the administration is over.''\par \par \uc2 But the most compelling reason that \uc2 Clinton\uc2  can pick whom she pleases is the ineffably large, epically polarizing presence of \uc2 Trump\uc2 . Any wavering voters who might be lured his way will be making a decision about him -- whether he's a protest vote with too high a price, whether a real leader can bloom where a peevish child still stomps and preens -- and not about the appeal of \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's No. 2.\par \par \uc2 ''The \uc2 Trump\uc2  card overwhelms it,'' said Doug Sosnik, a Democratic strategist who worked in \uc2 Bill \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's White House, adding that if either candidate's vice-presidential pick matters at all, it's \uc2 Trump\uc2 's. ''He might be able to reassure people that there's an adult on site.''\par \par \uc2 Not that he has many options, and that's another facet of these veepstakes that makes them different from any other. In elections past, strivers in both parties deflected questions about the vice presidency with a coyness designed to make clear that, yes, they'd run a lawn mower over beloved relatives if those haplessly positioned kinfolk stood in the way of the assignment.\par \par \uc2 In this \uc2 election\uc2 , young Republican stars and seasoned party veterans alike have dispensed with any coyness to stress that they'd rather do yard work than stand beside the gaudy topiary that is \uc2 Trump\uc2 . \uc2 Marco Rubio\uc2 , Nikki Haley, John Kasich, Scott Walker and more said, ''No, thanks,'' before \uc2 Trump\uc2  could even say, ''Please.''\par \par \uc2 And it's not just that they reject positions \uc2 Trump\uc2  has taken, flinch at words he has spoken and worry that he's more taint than gilt. They also fear how exposed they'd be.\par \par \uc2 NORMALLY, before a candidate and his or her aides choose a running mate, ''They develop an operation to defend and support the vice-presidential nominee,'' said Dan Senor, an adviser to \uc2 Mitt Romney\uc2 's 2012 presidential campaign who helped do precisely that for \uc2 Paul Ryan\uc2 . ''The minute that nominee is announced, there are 800 reporters breathing down your throat and the other side is going to war to shred the running mate's reputation.''\par \par \uc2 Nothing about the crude infrastructure and chaotic staff turnover of \uc2 Trump\uc2 's political organization would give his running mate much hope for protection from that savaging. ''Operationally, you could be destroyed,'' Senor said. ''The only resource the campaign has to defend you is \uc2 Trump\uc2 's Twitter account. What a disaster.''\par \par \uc2 Trump\uc2 's slim pickings are more an embarrassment than a curse. As Sosnik wrote in The \uc2 Washington Post\uc2  last week, ''The last time a vice-presidential selection may have altered the outcome was in 1960, when John F. Kennedy's choice of Lyndon B. Johnson assured Democrats of carrying Texas.''\par \par \uc2 Since then, the notion that a running mate should put a teetering state in the victory column has been repeatedly rejected or rebutted. Dick Cheney was from Wyoming, which George W. Bush was going to win anyway. Joe Lieberman was from Connecticut, where Al Gore was already destined to prevail.\par \par \uc2 John Edwards\uc2  was from North Carolina, which \uc2 John Kerry\uc2  proceeded to lose. Ryan was from Wisconsin, whose voters nonetheless chose Obama over Romney.\par \par \uc2 I pushed back at various political strategists: Surely the veep pick is a consequential moment?\par \par \uc2 ''To the media, yes,'' said Schoen. ''To the voters, no. Remember Dan Quayle? Spiro Agnew?'' They were the ankle weights on, respectively, the first President Bush and the only President Nixon, both of whom loped to victory regardless.\par \par \uc2 We're about to ignore that. We have paragraphs to write, airtime to fill. And like chefs talking up the momentousness of a meal, we'll present \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's and \uc2 Trump\uc2 's running mates as crucially palate-priming appetizers, perfectly complementary side dishes, make-or-break desserts.\par \par \uc2 Really they're just garnishes -- in \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's case, a mere sprig of parsley.\par \par \uc2 I invite you to follow me on Twitter (@FrankBruni) and join me on \uc2 Facebook\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Follow The \uc2 New York Times\uc2  Opinion section on \uc2 Facebook\uc2  and Twitter (@NYTopinion), and sign up for the Opinion Today newsletter.\par \par \uc2 DRAWING (DRAWING BY BEN WISEMAN) \par \par \uc2 Document NYTF000020160703ec7300061\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 National Desk; SECTA\par \b \uc2 How \uc2 Trump\uc2 's 'Birther' Claims Helped to Stir Presidential Bid\b0\par\par\uc2 By ASHLEY PARKER and STEVE EDER; Michael M. Grynbaum and Maggie Haberman contributed reporting. Kitty Bennett contributed research. \par \uc2 1,945 \uc2 words\par \uc2 3 July 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 1\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Joseph Farah, a 61-year-old author, had long labored on the fringes of political life, publishing a six-part series claiming that soybeans caused homosexuality and fretting that ''cultural Marxists'' were plotting to destroy the country.\par \par \uc2 But in early 2011, he received the first of several calls from a Manhattan real estate developer who wanted to take one of his theories mainstream.\par \par \uc2 That developer, \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , told Mr. Farah that he shared his suspicion that President Obama might have been born outside the United States and that he was looking for a way to prove it.\par \par \uc2 ''What can we do to get to the bottom of this?'' Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  asked him. ''What can we do to turn the tide?''\par \par \uc2 Mr. Farah recalled that Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  even proposed dispatching private investigators to Hawaii, Mr. Obama's birthplace, to resolve the debate.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's eagerness to embrace the so-called birther idea -- long debunked, and until then confined to right-wing conspiracy theorists -- foreshadowed how, just five years later, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  would bedevil his rivals in the Republican presidential primary race and upend the political system.\par \par \uc2 In the birther movement, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  recognized an opportunity to connect with the electorate over an issue many considered taboo: the discomfort, in some quarters of American society, with the \uc2 election\uc2  of the nation's first black president. He harnessed it for political gain, beginning his connection with the largely white Republican base that, in his 2016 campaign, helped clinch his party's nomination.\par \par \uc2 ''The appeal of the birther issue was, 'I'm going to take this guy on, and I'm going to beat him,''' said Sam Nunberg, who was one of Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's advisers during that period but was fired from his current campaign. ''It was a great niche and wedge issue.''\par \par \uc2 And starting in March 2011, when he first began to test the idea that a reality television star with no political experience could mount a campaign for the presidency, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  could not stop talking about it.\par \par \uc2 ''Why doesn't he show his birth certificate?'' he asked on ABC's ''The View.'' ''I want to see his birth certificate,'' he told Fox News's ''On the Record.'' And on NBC's ''Today Show,'' he declared, ''I'm starting to think that he was not born here.''\par \par \uc2 The more Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  questioned the legitimacy of Mr. Obama's presidency, the better he performed in the early polls of the 2012 Republican field, springing from fifth place to a virtual tie for first.\par \par \uc2 That frenzied period culminated six weeks after it began in a surreal televised split screen between Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  and the White House briefing room, where aides released an image of the president's birth certificate proving he was born in Honolulu and Mr. Obama directly addressed the issue.\par \par \uc2 It was a remarkable moment that Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  celebrated as a political victory.\par \par \uc2 Then Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  did something decidedly un-\uc2 Trump\uc2 -like: He dropped the issue and rarely spoke of it publicly again.\par \par \uc2 According to people apprised of the conversations, people close to him had been worried about the negative attention. Officials at NBC had also been concerned that he was alienating the large black audience of his hit show, ''The Apprentice.''\par \par \uc2 Indeed, damage had already been done. Some black leaders denounced him, with Jesse Jackson accusing Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  of appealing to the president's detractors with ''coded and covert rhetoric for stirring up racial fears.''\par \par \uc2 Several days later, Mr. Obama relished his own chance to belittle Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  with a string of taunts at the \uc2 White House Correspondents' Association\uc2  dinner, as Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , seated in the audience, grew increasingly stone-faced. ''But no one is happier, no one is prouder, to put this birth certificate matter to rest than the Donald,'' he said to laughter. ''And that's because he can finally get back to focusing on the issues that matter: Like, did we fake the moon landing?''\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , who declined to be interviewed about the subject, was not the first to question Mr. Obama's birthplace. The narrative that Mr. Obama, whose father was Kenyan and mother American, might not meet the requirement that the president be a ''natural-born citizen'' first arose during his 2008 bid.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Obama's aides initially decided it was better to ignore the questions; addressing them, they reasoned, would just given them credibility.\par \par \uc2 And Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , too, at first seemed uncertain about just how much skepticism to express over the president's place of birth. ''The reason I have a little doubt, just a little, is because he grew up and nobody knew him,'' he said in a March 2011 interview. ''The whole thing is very strange.''\par \par \uc2 Yet, quickly, the world took notice. One headline referred to Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  going ''Birther Lite.'' Another said he was a ''Teeny Bit Birther.'' And MSNBC's ''Hardball'' replayed the comments, with the intro: ''Let's listen to how he joins the birthers.''\par \par \uc2 If Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  was offering a political trial balloon, he appeared to like the results. He started making the rounds, offering interviews on the topic and stoking public interest in the birther claims.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  was egged on by one key adviser -- Roger J. Stone Jr., a dapper dresser and political operative known for mischief and mayhem. Mr. Stone said that he did not plant the idea with Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , but that once Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  came to him with it, he extolled what he saw as the political upside.\par \par \uc2 ''He was suspicious about it, or at least interested in it,'' Mr. Stone said. Among Republican base voters, he added, ''many of them believe the president is foreign-born, and \uc2 Trump\uc2  has an ability to interject any idea that is outside of the mainstream into the mainstream.''\par \par \uc2 A Gallup poll from that period showed that only 38 percent of Americans surveyed believed that Mr. Obama was ''definitely'' born in the United States. That number rose to 47 percent after Mr. Obama released his long-form birth certificate.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  also continued to reach out to Mr. Farah, founder of WorldNetDaily, a conservative website, as well as to \uc2 Jerome Corsi\uc2 , another conservative writer and author of ''Where's the Birth Certificate? The Case That \uc2 Barack Obama\uc2  is Not Eligible to Be President.'' (The book came out shortly after Mr. Obama released his birth certificate, but shot to the top of \uc2 Amazon.com\uc2 's best sellers before it was even officially published.)\par \par \uc2 ''He was looking for affirmation that he was on the right track,'' Mr. Farah said. ''He was looking for a smoking gun kind of sound bite that would resonate with people.''\par \par \uc2 But what most impressed Mr. Farah was just how many hours Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  was willing to devote to the question. ''This was a busy guy, this was a multibillionaire, and I was surprised that he was willing to spend that kind of time on it,'' he said.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Farah also stressed to Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  that the issue was one of ''transparency,'' and Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  began using the phrase.\par \par \uc2 ''He started saying 'transparency,''' said Mr. Nunberg, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's former adviser. ''It's code for, 'This guy is the Manchurian candidate.'''\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  also said repeatedly that he had sent a team of investigators to Hawaii to unearth information about Mr. Obama's birth records. ''They cannot believe what they are finding,'' Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  told ABC's ''The View.''\par \par \uc2 But as the issue exploded, people close to Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  were growing nervous.\par \par \uc2 Some people in Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's orbit were discomfited by the line of attack, which had already been examined and rejected by many conservative news outlets. Among them was an informal political adviser, Kellyanne Conway, a Republican pollster, who cautioned that if he did run, he would need to beat Mr. Obama ''on the merits.''\par \par \uc2 Even executives at NBC, which aired ''The Apprentice,'' privately called on him to tone down his remarks, fearing he would hurt ratings at a time when more than a million African-Americans tuned in every Thursday night, according to a former executive with knowledge of the discussions, speaking anonymously to share candid conversations.\par \par \uc2 The White House, too, had growing concerns. Once reserved to the fringe, the issue had now begun popping up at town-hall-style events around the country.\par \par \uc2 The turning point came in mid-April 2011, when the president delivered a major speech on the budget, only to find his remarks obscured by questions about his birth certificate.\par \par \uc2 ''It was basically a message blocker that was preventing us from talking about the issues we needed to talk about because the press was chasing \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  around for the next crazy thing he was going to say,'' said Dan Pfeiffer, the White House communications director then.\par \par \uc2 The White House counsel dispatched someone to Hawaii to find the president's original long-form birth certificate from 1961. (Years before, the president had released the ''short form,'' an official computer-generated document that contains the information from the original.) With the document finally in hand, aides quickly scheduled a news conference.\par \par \uc2 They worried that having Mr. Obama himself release his birth certificate from the White House briefing room would undermine the dignity of the office. So they first passed out copies to reporters, and then had the president deliver remarks, in which he warned the nation about getting distracted by ''sideshows and carnival barkers.''\par \par \uc2 Then, almost as quickly as it began, the controversy subsided. And several weeks later, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  decided not to seek the Republican nomination. Though he continued to do well in polls, he seemed to be more focused on his reality television pursuits.\par \par \uc2 Now, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  almost assiduously refuses to discuss the topic, which, according to several people close to him, was always more about political performance art than ideology.\par \par \uc2 ''I don't talk about that anymore,'' Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  told the MSNBC host Chris Matthews after a Republican debate last year.\par \par \uc2 Raising questions about the president's birth certificate -- and even threatening to send a team of investigators to Hawaii -- had served its purpose, raising Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's political profile and, whether he knew it or not at the time, providing him with the rudimentary foundation upon which he built his 2016 campaign.\par \par \uc2 He even skirted close to birther innuendo after the massacre in Orlando, Fla., last month, calling into ''Fox & Friends'' to insinuate that Mr. Obama might sympathize with Islamic extremists. ''He doesn't get it or he gets it better than anybody understands,'' Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  said.\par \par \uc2 But for all of his fascination with the president's birth certificate, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  apparently never dispatched investigators or made much of an effort to find the documents.\par \par \uc2 Dr. Alvin Onaka, the Hawaii state registrar who handled queries about Mr. Obama, said recently through a spokeswoman that he had no evidence or recollection of Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  or any of his representatives ever requesting the records from the \uc2 Hawaii State Department of Health\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Find out what you need to know about the 2016 presidential race today, and get politics news updates via \uc2 Facebook\uc2 , \uc2 Twitter\uc2  and the First Draft newsletter.\par \par \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2  in 2011 in Portsmouth, N.H., on the same day that President Obama released his long-form birth certificate.

\par\par \uc2 Business World\par \b \uc2 Trump\uc2 's Would Be No Ordinary Defeat\b0\par\par\uc2 By Holman W. Jenkins, Jr.   \par \uc2 811 \uc2 words\par \uc2 2 July 2016\par \uc2 The Wall Street Journal\par \uc2 J\par A11\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 Before they gather in Cleveland for their convention, it's not too soon for Republicans to begin thinking about what exactly a \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  defeat might be like.\par \par \uc2 As with his now-documented habit of charitable promises that seldom materialize, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  never intended to endanger a sizable part of personal wealth to fund a presidential campaign. That means he'll continue to campaign on the cheap, by saying incendiary things and having them transmitted by the free media. Expect more speeches like the protectionist-cum-conspiracy theory speeches in suburban Pittsburgh on Tuesday and New Hampshire on Thursday, even if such diatribes frighten major donors and mainstream Republicans and make life harder for down-ticket Republican candidates in the fall.\par \par \uc2 In his mind, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  may still envision a populist prairie fire carrying him to the White House. This is not his best plan to win, he may also admit to himself, but the one he's willing to pay for.\par \par \uc2 Here resides the problem all along for those hoping for a \uc2 Trump\uc2 -to-the-middle move. Such moves are expensive. Base-broadening campaigns require lots of paid TV to reach non-engaged voters and \uc2 Trump\uc2  skeptics, pummeling them with reassuring images suggesting that a \uc2 Trump\uc2  presidency would be OK.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  not only is unwilling or unable to finance such a campaign. He evidently is unwilling to do what's necessary to entice GOP donors to finance it on his behalf. This means GOP officeholders seeking re-\uc2 election\uc2  can expect a constant headwind of inflammatory \uc2 Trump\uc2  statements designed to stimulate the free media coverage that his asset-lite campaign requires. Republican candidates up and down the ballot therefore become unwilling sharers of a high-risk \uc2 Trump\uc2  electoral wager, a gamble more likely to end in a Hillary landslide than a \uc2 Trump\uc2  White House.\par \par \uc2 The more intriguing question concerns what happens if Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  decides he can't win and no longer is willing to throw good money after bad. Unless they were born on a turnip truck yesterday, campaign vendors will be the first to figure it out. Look for them quickly to cut off services rather than get stiffed in the inevitable \uc2 Trump\uc2  campaign bankruptcy filing.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's harsher Republican critics are kidding themselves to think Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  is crazy or unstable and will suffer a breakdown. More likely, he will simply and coldbloodedly toss the ball to the GOP, saying, in effect, "If you want to pay for some events or TV, I'm available. Otherwise I'm done." The GOP would then have to shoulder the dual burden of propping up a minimally respectable \uc2 Trump\uc2  campaign while also distancing its down-ballot candidates from Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  so they might survive.\par \par \uc2 And that's the optimistic scenario. Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  has learned the value of audacity. He might well decide to cover his retreat and preserve his amour propre with a flurry of lawsuits and conspiracy theories about a "rigged" \uc2 election\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 He's already begun putting narrative flesh on these bones. He speaks of "crooked Hillary" and increasingly of the \uc2 Clinton\uc2  Global Initiative, \uc2 Bill \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's philanthropy, and what he calls the Clintons' "politics of personal profit and theft." In his trade speeches, he portrays the Clintons as members of a nefarious global elite that has enriched itself while foisting impoverishing trade deals on the U.S. middle class.\par \par \uc2 He perhaps will throw in a few suggestions that foreign governments hold hidden leverage over Hillary because of her hacked, illegal email server. He'll mention \uc2 Bill \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's pardon of Marc Rich.\par \par \uc2 Republicans can also expect to be a target of his accusations. He doesn't need to be plausible, just tell a story that justifies his own stance that he didn't lose, the other side cheated, "Washington elites" conspired against him, etc.\par \par \uc2 If the \uc2 Trump\uc2  endgame is destined to go this way, Republicans should hope it does so early, ideally before the convention is even over. To date, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  continues to tease top GOPers and conservatives with the idea that he may yet come their way, turn his formidable talents to advancing conservative causes. This merciless exploiting of Republican romantics has begun to seem like something out of "The Blue Angel" or Lucy with the football.\par \par \uc2 Republicans need a strategy, and lots of money to fund it, to preserve their House and Senate majorities. Do they know it? The thing they should fear most: An autumn dynamic in which Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  believes the best outcome for him personally is one that does as much damage as possible to the long-run GOP cause.\par \par \uc2 (See related letter: "Letters to the Editor: Would Medical Conditions Be a \uc2 Trump\uc2  Exit Strategy?" -- WSJ July 16, 2016)\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=wjco20160702000115"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document J000000020160715ec7200064\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw272\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4080\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 In your editorial " Liberating the Delegates" (June 27), you relate that Beau Correll is suing in court to overturn the law that says he must vote for the winner of the presidential primary in his state as he is a Virginia delegate and by law must vote for the candidate chosen by the people. He states that in good conscience he cannot support \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2 . The simple answer: resign as a delegate. His conscience doesn't seem to bother him in relation to his pledge to support the candidate the people have chosen. The people have spoken. It is Mr. Correll, not they, who must step aside.\par \par \uc2 Lee Brown\par \par \uc2 Houston\par \par \uc2 ---\par \par \uc2 In your editorial you assert: "Political parties are private entities whose purpose is to meet to nominate a presidential candidate." If so, what business do state governments, like ours here in Florida, have conducting and picking up the tab for their party's primaries?\par \par \uc2 Leo Bueno\par \par \uc2 Coral Gables, Fla.\par \par \uc2 ---\par \par \uc2 With a straight face, the Journal says a delegate has First Amendment rights, possibly allowing Virginia's Mr. Correll to vote his "conscience" instead of for the primary winner. Ridiculous. One hundred percent of delegate power draws from electorate consent and the corresponding party rules requiring delegates to serve the will of primary voters on the first ballot. For anyone to now say that the Constitution could forbid that delegation of power to Mr. Correll and others is obvious post-hoc soup crying.\par \par \uc2 What's next? Having members of the electoral college ignore the voters in their states and vote for whomever they want?\par \par \uc2 Randy Berger\par \par \uc2 New York\par \par \uc2 ---\par \par \uc2 If Mr. Correll has his way, what of the rights of all of us who went through the effort of voting in the Virginia primary, using our time and taxpayer dollars in what would become an irrelevant \uc2 election\uc2 ?\par \par \uc2 Larry Stewart\par \par \uc2 Vienna, Va.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=wjco20160702000109"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document J000000020160915ec7200009\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw272\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4080\pichgoal600

\par\par \b \uc2 The Weekend Interview with \uc2 W. Taylor Reveley IV\uc2 : Teaching the 'Habits of Democracy'\b0\par\par\uc2 By Joseph Rago   \par \uc2 1,876 \uc2 words\par \uc2 2 July 2016\par \uc2 The Wall Street Journal\par \uc2 J\par A9\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 Farmville, Va. -- Perhaps, on the first Tuesday of October, \uc2 Chris Christie\uc2  will confront Elizabeth Warren in this rural Old Dominion town, or maybe Tim Kaine will take on \uc2 Ivanka \uc2 Trump\uc2 . Whomever \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  and \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  choose as their running mates, they'll wind up on a stage in Farmville, the seat of \uc2 Longwood University\uc2 , which is hosting this year's sole vice-presidential debate.\par \par \uc2 "One of the great achievements in American civic life is the fact that the public, the body politic, now has this expectation that the major candidates are going to come together and, in a civil way, talk about the issues," says \uc2 W. Taylor Reveley IV\uc2 , the school's president since 2013. "That feels very normal to us at this point, but it's not normal around the world and it wasn't even normal in the U.S. until '76 in part and in full until '88" -- when the \uc2 Commission on Presidential Debates\uc2  formalized an ad hoc process that had been run by the \uc2 League of Women Voters\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 "Civil" and "normal" are not the first words that spring to mind to describe this \uc2 election\uc2 . Offering to host one of the coming debates -- hundreds of schools compete for the honor every four years -- probably seemed like a better idea before anyone knew who the candidates would be. Back then the event conjured up a pageant of democracy, not 24-hour security, protest zones and potential threats of violence.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Reveley allows that the Longwood debate may be "operatic" -- imagine a Christie-Warren matchup -- and adds that "2016 has had enough colorful aspects to it that you never know what might transpire." But he also describes, with genuine spirit, "that burst of civic energy and that excitement on the part of all the students who will participate in a once-in-a-lifetime historic occasion."\par \par \uc2 If that sounds like the sentiment of a less cynical era, then little-known Longwood -- founded in 1839 near where the last major engagements of the Civil War would be fought before Lee surrendered at Appomattox -- seems out of time. So does Mr. Reveley. He is only 41 years old but has a thoughtful and almost 19th-century quality to him, which somehow befits the first third-generation college president in U.S. history. His father, Reveley III, is president of William & Mary, and his grandfather, Reveley II, was president of Hampden-Sydney College a couple miles away from Farmville. On his campus this week Mr. Reveley -- the IV -- talked about the \uc2 election\uc2 , how modern academia is failing students and the country, and how the recovery of civic education could improve the distemper of American politics.\par \par \uc2 The inspiration to host a debate came in 2014 when Mr. Reveley was teaching an undergraduate seminar on the American presidency. A student mentioned offhand how holding the event would strengthen what Mr. Reveley calls "the genuine and deep historical mission of this place, which is the preparation of citizen leaders. We really do, like the boat against the current, believe that the role of college is not purely jobs. It's democracy. It's to produce citizens."\par \par \uc2 To that end, Longwood is incorporating the national scene into the curriculum, with 31 pilot classes offered this fall that touch on the \uc2 election\uc2  in some way. The course catalog will range from the straightforward ("Presidential Elections," political science) to the creative ("Thinking Strategically: Applied Game Theory," economics) to the unusual ("On the Campaign Trail," a photography class in the art department). An English professor will teach the Constitution "as a piece of wordcraft," Mr. Reveley says. There's even the wry: "Deception and Lying," or Communications 361.\par \par \uc2 Over time, these experiments will form a core Longwood curriculum. All across the pastoral campus, lamppost flags announce the arrival of "Debate 2016." You might call the school \uc2 Clinton\uc2 -\uc2 Trump\uc2  University, albeit without the deceptive marketing.\par \par \uc2 This engagement with current affairs is in keeping with the traditional liberal arts, "which is a phrase that's gotten very complicated," Mr. Reveley says. " Liberalism is a word that has completely changed its meaning, or lost its original sense. Radical, the same thing has happened. Manufacture: another word that used to mean a thing built by hand."\par \par \uc2 He explains: " Liberalism used to mean things pertaining to citizenship. In Latin, it's the same root as the word for liberty. If you were converting what people meant by liberal arts in the early 20th century to 21-century vernacular, it's something like citizenship studies."\par \par \uc2 Over "the last generation and a half," Mr. Reveley estimates, the liberal arts have come to mean "reading a lot of Sartre." More seriously, the humanities and social sciences have turned toward "personal understanding and development of your own personal sensibilities: They help you know yourself." Mr. Reveley disagrees. "The purpose ought to be broader," he says. The real question ought to be: "How do you bring to bear the great bodies of knowledge to the act of living a life in a free society?"\par \par \uc2 The Founders, Mr. Reveley says, appropriately for Independence Day, "really thought about the role of college in American life." Jefferson founded the \uc2 University of Virginia\uc2 ; Washington was the first American chancellor of William & Mary. Mr. Reveley calls Madison "the first graduate student," who stayed at Princeton after graduation to study Hebrew and theology, "and then went home to live with his parents."\par \par \uc2 The success of the American project, as Mr. Reveley reads the Founders, depended on knowledgeable citizens. "It was of paramount importance," he says, "that there were enough people educated broadly enough and specifically educated to be participants in a free society -- which is what the curriculum was deliberately geared toward, that there would be the wherewithal within the body politic to ask the right questions, to have the wisdom to elect the leaders with the temperament and character to preserve liberty."\par \par \uc2 Speaking of which, the electorate seems to be searching at the moment, rather desperately, for such higher-minded choices. According to this week's Wall Street Journal-NBC poll, 45% of Democrats would have preferred someone other than Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  as their nominee, and 52% of Republicans preferred someone other than Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 . In a sardonic Public Policy Polling survey, also released this week, voters were given a choice of Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  or a giant meteor hitting the Earth. One in eight went with the meteor.\par \par \uc2 As Mr. Reveley sees it, politics isn't dysfunctional because of polarization, per se, so much as political detachment. "Fewer people, a smaller portion of the American public, is paying closer attention to American politics," he says. "It's certainly correlation and I think there's some causation, that American higher education has stopped, in the main, thinking of citizenship and democracy as its basic purpose and begun to think in a much narrower sense of 'college is good for career.' " If kids lack faith in, or appreciation for, the principles of self-government, then politics will naturally atrophy.\par \par \uc2 Wait a sec: Is what can sound like ivory-tower grandiosity -- though Longwood is not a rich and only a modestly selective school -- disconnected from the economic reality and students' demand for useful skills in the marketplace? Mr. Reveley concedes that higher education plays "an instrumental role in economic progress," and he could see an alternative credentialing model emerge that awards "merit badges for skills" like coding Java or speaking German.\par \par \uc2 "Is college necessary for economic growth? I think so, but I could conceive of other ways that could be achieved," he explains. "Is it necessary for democracy? Like the Founders, I would say that it absolutely is. What I cannot conceive of is how we could have robust democracy and free society without the advantages of college."\par \par \uc2 But this year of campus protests and safe spaces hasn't been an illustrious one for colleges either. More intellectual energy seems to be devoted to seeking offense where none exists and shutting down debate, rather than litigating new and challenging ideas.\par \par \uc2 "That's something I think about a lot," Mr. Reveley says, "and the generational line is maybe helpful for us. My granddad started at Hampden-Sydney in the summer of '63 and wrapped up in '77 -- so he essentially ran from Kennedy's assassination through the bicentennial, which was about as tumultuous an era in American social life as there ever was."\par \par \uc2 Over this stretch, he says, the idea that colleges would act in loco parentis "almost completely broke down as an ethos." But maybe the breakdown is not permanent. "Today, there is almost a pining for something like it to return," he says. "For a long time the student mind-set, the parent mind-set was to be hands off, allow for a maximum of personal freedom and personal discretion, independent of the effects that might have. Now on the part of students and parents there is a strong appetite for what was lost. To have a stronger sense of oversight and care and protection."\par \par \uc2 Mr. Reveley traces the social friction to a loss of purpose. Civic education can help build a society where people with deep disagreements can nonetheless imagine how others think and make sense of the world. It is an education, in other words, "in the habits of democracy," as Mr. Reveley puts it. "It means a lot to be able to sit around with people from different parts of the country and different walks of life with different perspectives and talk through things. That matters."\par \par \uc2 The fundamental problem with American higher education, he adds, is that "there's no North Star." In an age when the highest aspiration of every school is to be interchangeable with all the others, being self-consciously different is -- to use one of his words in the old-fashioned sense -- a radical act of imagination.\par \par \uc2 So is Mr. Reveley optimistic about the future of self-government? "I am, " he replies. "I think if there is a particular thing we've lost sight of in American life it is a vision of the future."\par \par \uc2 This vision, he says, as developed by "what we used to call, once upon a time, the liberal tradition," looked "remarkably like what a great college campus looks like -- rich with traditions, civic traditions; actually beautiful, a delight to be in that space; infused with real understanding of the past and the strength that we can draw from it but also intensely focused on how we can make progress."\par \par \uc2 Mr. Reveley continues: "I honestly deeply do think that if American life could resemble more what life is like at our best colleges and universities we'd have a lot to be optimistic about. Even in the midst of a" -- he pauses a beat -- "colorful \uc2 election\uc2  cycle, I am optimistic. Having this debate here is a measure of that optimism. It's a point of real pride, a point of real joy."\par \par \uc2 We'll have to loop back after October's debate to see if he still feels the same way.\par \par \uc2 ---\par \par \uc2 Mr. Rago is a member of the Journal's editorial board.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=wjco20160702000100"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document J000000020160915ec7200001\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw272\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4080\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 Democratic presidential candidate \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  raised nearly $70 million in June for her campaign, the \uc2 Democratic National Committee\uc2  and state parties across the U.S., her best fundraising month so far, her campaign said on Friday.\par \par \uc2 Of the $68.5 million raised last month by Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's campaign, $40.5 million will go to her campaign and approximately $28 million will go to the DNC and state parties. Those state parties will use the funds for volunteer recruiting and field organizing for Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's campaign and other Democratic candidates.\par \par \uc2 Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's campaign enters July in a dominant financial position, with $44 million on hand. Her Republican rival, \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2 , hasn't announced his June fundraising totals, but he has struggled with fundraising since becoming the presumptive nominee.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  raised $3.1 million in May and had just $1.3 million cash on hand entering June -- a paltry sum for a presidential campaign entering a general \uc2 election\uc2  match-up.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  has since increased his grass-roots donor outreach through email and has indicated that he may be willing to self-fund his general \uc2 election\uc2  bid.\par \par \uc2 The New York businessman also appointed a national finance chairman and finalized a joint fundraising vehicle with the \uc2 Republican National Committee\uc2  in May.\par \par \uc2 "Our first month of general-\uc2 election\uc2  fundraising proved to be the best of the campaign," said \uc2 Clinton\uc2  campaign manager Robby Mook in a statement. "Thanks to the continued support of nearly 1.6 million people, we have been able to help Democrats build out an organizing infrastructure across the country that will mobilize millions of voters and help elect progressive candidates up and down the ballot."\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=wjco20160702000035"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document J000000020160914ec7200008\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw272\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4080\pichgoal600

\par\par \b \uc2 Election\uc2  2016: Green Party Makes Inroads --- Pursuit of Sanders supporters threatens to siphon Democratic votes from \uc2 Clinton\b0\par\par\uc2 By Byron Tau   \par \uc2 747 \uc2 words\par \uc2 2 July 2016\par \uc2 The Wall Street Journal\par \uc2 J\par A4\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 WASHINGTON -- Green Party presidential candidate Jill Stein is aggressively courting disaffected supporters of Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, potentially undermining Democratic efforts to unify the party behind presumptive nominee \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Ms. Stein, the presumptive Green Party nominee, has been making the case in interviews, rallies and appearances across the country that supporters of Mr. Sanders should consider casting a ballot for her in the fall, emphasizing the common agenda and progressive worldview they share.\par \par \uc2 "We're picking up where Bernie left off. In fact, you could say we were here back in 2012 doing the same thing, long before Bernie's campaign," Ms. Stein said in an interview Friday.\par \par \uc2 Ms. Stein, 66 years old, said her campaign has seen an influx of interest since Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  was declared the presumptive Democratic Party nominee after she secured enough delegates to deny Mr. Sanders the nomination -- a point buttressed by her rising poll numbers.\par \par \uc2 "For many people, we've been Plan B for when Bernie got shut down by the Democrats. And from my perspective, that's pretty much what was going to happen," she said, adding: "It's hard to have a revolution in a counter-revolutionary party."\par \par \uc2 With Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  and her likely Republican rival \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  two of the most unpopular nominees in history, polls have found a growing appetite for alternatives. The most recent Wall Street Journal/NBC poll released this past week had Ms. Stein drawing 6% of the vote nationwide in a four-way matchup with Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , and Libertarian \uc2 Gary Johnson\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Ms. Stein's agenda calls for a higher minimum wage, a focus on renewable energy, better job security, universal health care and free education -- all issues that Mr. Sanders has embraced. Their biggest contrast comes on foreign policy, where Ms. Stein has proposed massive defense cuts and disarmament.\par \par \uc2 The poll also shows that 14% of self-identified supporters of Mr. Sanders are backing Ms. Stein, while 9% say they support Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 . Another 8% say they will support the Libertarian ticket.\par \par \uc2 "Right now, she's definitely a landing spot for Sanders supporters who are not ready to commit to \uc2 Clinton\uc2  or don't like \uc2 Clinton\uc2 ," said Tom Jensen, the polling director at the Democratic firm Public Policy Polling.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Jensen said both the Green Party and Libertarian presidential tickets are unlikely to pull more than a few percentage points in the fall, but that margin could be a problem in tight swing states.\par \par \uc2 "In a close race, you don't want to lose any support, of course. Just ask Al Gore, who might have been president if [Ralph] Nader had not taken votes from him," said Dan Pfeiffer, a former top adviser to President \uc2 Barack Obama\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 In the 2000 presidential race, Mr. Nader, running as head of the Green Party, drew nearly 100,000 left-leaning votes in Florida, while Democratic nominee Mr. Gore lost the state by about 500 votes to Republican nominee George W. Bush.\par \par \uc2 Ms. Stein, a Harvard-educated physician, first emerged on the political scene in Massachusetts in 2002, where she launched a bid for governor on the Green-Rainbow Party ticket. She got about 3% of the vote in a race won by future Republican presidential candidate \uc2 Mitt Romney\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 She went on to run statewide in Massachusetts two more times, launching unsuccessful bids for secretary of the commonwealth in 2006 and governor in 2010. She won the Green Party presidential nomination in 2012 and drew about 479,000 votes nationwide after appearing on ballots in 36 states. This year, the party is aiming to be on the ballot in 47 states.\par \par \uc2 Her current level of support in the poll would be double the Green Party's best-ever electoral showing at the presidential level, which was in 2000 when Mr. Nader, a consumer advocate, drew about 3% of the vote nationwide.\par \par \uc2 Most alarming for Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  is that the third-party candidates appear to be cutting into her clear lead against Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 . Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  has a five-point lead in a head-to-head matchup against Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  in the Wall Street Journal/NBC poll. When the Libertarian and Green Party candidates are included, her lead declines to just one point.\par \par \uc2 Her campaign declined to comment on Ms. Stein, as did Mr. Sanders's campaign.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=wjco20160702000033"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document J000000020160914ec7200007\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw272\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4080\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 DENVER -- In his first visit to the battleground state of Colorado since an October debate, Republican presumptive nominee \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  on Friday continued to lash out at the "rigged system" he says deprived him of the state's convention delegates.\par \par \uc2 Though he essentially clinched the nomination two months ago, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  spent much of his speech to thousands of conservative activists reviving grudges from the primary season.\par \par \uc2 Colorado was among a handful of states that held party-run meetings to award delegates instead of statewide primaries. Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  was outmaneuvered by former rival Ted Cruz, who swept all of the state's delegates in April.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  also pointed to Louisiana, where he won the most primary votes but came away with fewer delegates than Mr. Cruz.\par \par \uc2 "I learned so much during the primaries," said Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , three weeks before he's expected to accept his party's nomination in Cleveland. "That's when I realized it's rigged, people, it's rigged."\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's rallying cry -- applied to the political system he ran in as well as the wider economy -- helped him win more votes than any other Republican presidential candidate in history, as many Americans feel trampled by politicians and Wall Street and other special interests.\par \par \uc2 But Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's continued rehashing of the primary in his speech at the Western Conservative Summit distracted from his attacks on Democrat \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  and the other major themes of his campaign.\par \par \uc2 "Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  needs to focus on \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , not Ted Cruz," said U.S. Rep. Ken Buck, a Cruz supporter who says he will back Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  as the nominee. "That's not how you go about mending fences."\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  is also under pressure to build the massive infrastructure and fundraising network demanded for a general \uc2 election\uc2  matchup against Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 . He just hired a state director in this crucial battleground state this week, two months after Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  began building a team here.\par \par \uc2 A recent CBS News/YouGov poll found Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  and Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  essentially tied in the state.\par \par \uc2 "We do have to win Colorado," Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  said. "I'll be back a lot, don't worry about it."\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  said the U.S. is being "destroyed" by free trade and illegal immigration, which he blamed for "unbelievable crime pouring in." Countries are "ripping us off" by depending on the U.S. for military protection.\par \par \uc2 "You're going to see job loss like we've never seen before if I don't win," he said.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  also quipped that it was "just a coincidence" that former President \uc2 Bill \uc2 Clinton\uc2  recently met with U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch, amid the \uc2 FBI\uc2 's scrutiny of Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's use of a private email server.\par \par \uc2 "It's a very serious thing to have a thing like that happen. So sad," said Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Ms. Lynch said this week that she and Mr. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  didn't discuss the email matter.\par \par \uc2 "When it comes to Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , he's always going to say what's on his mind, " said state Sen. Tim Neville, who represents part of Denver. "When he talks about the level of cronyism in this country, that's huge."\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  boasted about vanquishing more than a dozen rivals during the primary despite his lack of political experience, and he threw a punch at those who have declined to endorse him.\par \par \uc2 "They were really nasty to me, and I was really nasty to them, and some of them just can't understand the importance of a victory for the Republicans," he said.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  was preceded on stage by former vice presidential nominee \uc2 Sarah Palin\uc2 , one of the earliest backers of Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Like Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , the former governor of Alaska faced resistance from GOP elders and said she had a name for the Republicans who refuse to get behind Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 "I just call them Republicans Against \uc2 Trump\uc2 , or RAT for short," she said.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=wjco20160702000034"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document J000000020160914ec7200006\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw272\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4080\pichgoal600

\par\par \b \uc2 U.S. News: Soaring Child-Care Costs Squeeze Families --- Outlays rise nearly twice as fast as inflation since 2009; no money for 'extras'\b0\par\par\uc2 By Eric Morath   \par \uc2 813 \uc2 words\par \uc2 2 July 2016\par \uc2 The Wall Street Journal\par \uc2 J\par A3\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 The fast-growing cost of raising children is putting extra pressure on family budgets, causing resentment to spill over in day-care parking lots and soccer fields and even into the 2016 \uc2 election\uc2  debate.\par \par \uc2 Child care expenses alone have climbed nearly twice as fast as overall prices since the recession ended in 2009, according to Labor Department data. Along with fast-rising housing costs and lackluster wage gains, families with young children are finding themselves stretched enough to draw special attention from presidential candidates.\par \par \uc2 Democratic candidate \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  introduced a proposal to limit child-care costs to 10% of a family's income, which would represent a dramatic cost reduction for many families. Republican candidate \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  hasn't made specific child-care proposals, but he has said that he will help middle-class families with tax cuts and simplification of the tax code.\par \par \uc2 One trouble for families: As jobs have become more plentiful, demand for child care has increased -- pushing up its cost and partially offsetting income gains.\par \par \uc2 The cost of raising a child born in 2013 until age 18 is projected to be $245,340, according to Agriculture Department data. That is nearly five years of income for the median U.S. household. By comparison, the cost of raising a child born in 2003 was $226,108 after adjusting for inflation. The jump in overall inflation-adjusted costs mainly reflects increases in child-care, education and health-care expenses.\par \par \uc2 These outlays partly accounts for why many families don't feel financially secure. An April Gallup poll found that 37% of Americans between 30 and 49, the age when many are raising children, said they didn't have enough money to live comfortably. That was the highest share of any age group.\par \par \uc2 Child-care costs account for almost a quarter of Malki Karkowsky's family budget. Add in rent for her family's Kensington, Md., apartment, and more than half of her and her husband's monthly take-home pay is gone, she said. The 35-year-old has a 3-year-old son and a daughter under the age of 1. "Thankfully, we can cover the cost of food and clothing, but not really the extras," she said.\par \par \uc2 The family aspires to buy a home, but saving is difficult for the nonprofit executive and her husband, a schoolteacher. The family moved farther away from Mrs. Karkowsky's job in downtown Washington to cut housing costs. The move saved $350 a month, "but that doesn't even cover a week of day care," she said.\par \par \uc2 In 41 states, the cost of sending a 4-year-old to full-time preschool exceeds 10% of a median family income -- the level the federal government deems to be affordable -- according to data from the left-leaning \uc2 Economic Policy Institute\uc2 . Full-time preschool is more expensive than average tuition at a public college in 23 states. Care for an infant costs more than average rent in 17 states, the study found.\par \par \uc2 Since the recession ended in mid-2009, the cost of child care and nursery school has increased at a 2.9% annual average, outstripping overall inflation of 1.6% during that seven-year period. Overall inflation has been modest in recent years mainly due to lower gasoline prices. But the cost of child care accelerated in 2014 and 2015, coinciding with the jobless rate falling to about 5%.\par \par \uc2 Increased costs are a struggle for many families, especially because incomes, when adjusted for inflation, are barely above prerecession levels. Tight budgeting "makes it challenging for them to save and create economic security for themselves, particularly at the bottom," said Erin Currier, director of the financial security and mobility project at \uc2 Pew Charitable Trusts\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 The squeeze in some cases has parents pushing off home purchases or college savings, creating long-term challenges.\par \par \uc2 LaToya Caldwell, 33, a shift supervisor at a Kansas City \uc2 Wendy's\uc2  restaurant, works full time at $10 an hour but says she struggles to meet even the most basic needs for her five children. Care for her two youngest children -- when she can afford it -- accounts for about a quarter of her take-home pay. Ms. Caldwell said that makes it difficult to afford rent, utility bills and clothes and shoes for her children.\par \par \uc2 "Sometimes, I can't send them to day care because I don't have enough money," she said, forcing her to ask neighbors or family members to watch them.

Depends on the President\b0\par\par\uc2 By PAUL SULLIVAN \par \uc2 1,523 \uc2 words\par \uc2 2 July 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 4\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 BOB CACCHIONE took a bowl of jelly beans with him the first time he went to the White House to meet Ronald Reagan. But before he could deliver his gift, the president's director of protocol dumped out the jelly beans and left the room. She returned a few minutes later, the bowl now filled with the Jelly Belly brand jelly beans that were President Reagan's favorite.\par \par \uc2 ''They were the only jelly beans the president would eat,'' he said.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Cacchione, then a senior executive at Cartier, was there to present gifts that President Reagan and his cabinet officials might give on official trips. But as a result of their three in-person meetings, he became a collector of Reagan memorabilia, including the blazer buttons and cuff links Cartier made for him.\par \par \uc2 ''He was a horseback rider and I'm a horseback rider,'' said Mr. Cacchione, who founded the Intercollegiate Horse Show Association. ''With Ronald Reagan, I got to talk horses a lot.''\par \par \uc2 Richard S. Berg, chief executive of the financial services advisory firm Performance Trust Capital Partners, has taken a different tack in collecting presidential memorabilia, focusing on unique objects or foundational documents. He bought one of the four pens Abraham Lincoln used to sign the Emancipation Proclamation.\par \par \uc2 But he also bought the second Lincoln bedroom set, which is for guests at his home in Chicago. ''Mary Todd Lincoln ordered two and canceled one,'' he said. ''She caught a big backlash on the amount of money she spent redecorating the White House.''\par \par \uc2 Mr. Berg did not want to specify how much he paid for his Lincoln bed, whose provenance was confirmed by Bill Rau, a New Orleans antiques dealer who bought it from a family in western Illinois. He said only that it cost him $50,000 to $100,000, adding, ''The only antiques in my house are in that bedroom.''\par \par \uc2 In some ways, the collection of presidential memorabilia is a subsection of collecting Americana or antiques. But given the finite supply of presidential material, the uniqueness attracts people with very specific interests.\par \par \uc2 Some collectors like campaign buttons, programs and placards from conventions, or flags. Others focus on specific presidents.\par \par \uc2 Collectors and dealers say political parties matter less for collectors than the piece or particular president.\par \par \uc2 ''It's the item,'' said James Gillis, who handles global sales at M. S. Rau Antiques in New Orleans. ''There are only 44 presidents. No presidential materials are negative. People from all over the country collect them.''\par \par \uc2 Lincoln memorabilia are coveted most, and are among the best investments, followed by items associated with George Washington and the two Roosevelts. In more recent times, John F. Kennedy and Ronald Reagan have become popular among aficionados.\par \par \uc2 Experts say buying memorabilia with an eye toward potential value requires focus, caution and patience. Fakes are certainly a problem. But there is also a lot of historical but worthless material in the marketplace.\par \par \uc2 Take presidential campaign buttons. Ted Hake, the owner of Hake's Americana and Collectibles in York, Pa., and an expert on buttons, said the first campaign buttons as we know them were for the 1896 campaign between William Jennings Bryan and William McKinley.\par \par \uc2 ''They cranked out thousands of designs for each candidate,'' Mr. Hake said. ''The button was such a novelty that everyone jumped on the bandwagon. Buttons swept the country.''\par \par \uc2 But because of that supply, Mr. Hake said, a 120-year-old button is worth about $10 today. Yet any button made for the 1920 presidential campaign that has both James M. Cox for president and Franklin Delano Roosevelt as vice president on it is valuable. He said one in good condition could be worth $25,000, with perfect examples worth as much as $150,000.\par \par \uc2 For those wondering about \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2  or \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  buttons, he said most would probably be worth little because buttons are not the marketing tools they once were and are not being produced in large quantities by the campaigns.\par \par \uc2 ''The ones that are worth something were made for an official purpose in a local area and produced in small quantities,'' he said '''Transportation Workers of Bergen County for Hillary' -- they might only make a couple hundred of those.''\par \par \uc2 Similarly, buttons from President Obama's Illinois State Senate races are rare and could be worth $200 to $300.\par \par \uc2 ''The most common mistake is trying to buy it all,'' he said, since buttons are small and easier to store than other types of memorabilia. ''Sooner or later, the material is going to overwhelm you.''\par \par \uc2 And if it doesn't overwhelm you, it could just be an expense, not an investment. ''You need to be a specialist in one area,'' said Jeff R. Bridgman, an expert on American flags. ''Generalists make a lot more mistakes. Documents, buttons, ribbons, porcelain -- each has its own eccentricities.''\par \par \uc2 Morris W. Offit, the chairman of Offit Capital, a wealth management advisory firm in New York, said his initial interest in presidential collecting was set off when he tagged along with his wife to an antiques fair and saw American flags with the stars arrayed differently. (The star pattern wasn't set until an executive order from President William Howard Taft in 1912.)\par \par \uc2 Mr. Offit now has over 40 flags displayed around his office, including some with different star patterns and some with the names, faces or slogans of candidates on them. ''You become pretty picky over the years,'' he said. ''I look for something that is different, has a little narrative associated with it or gives some insights into that period of time.''\par \par \uc2 After 15 years of collecting flags, he said one still eludes him. In the \uc2 election\uc2  of 1860, Lincoln ran against three other candidates: \uc2 John Bell\uc2 , John C. Breckinridge and Stephen A. Douglas.\par \par \uc2 He has Lincoln, Bell and Douglas flags. ''A few years ago, a Breckinridge came on the market,'' he said. ''The price was not within my capability.''\par \par \uc2 Mr. Offit didn't want to discuss what he had paid for his flags. But some flags fetch six figures. A United States flag with the presidential seal that flew over Franklin Roosevelt's home in Hyde Park, N.Y., sold for $98,000 two years ago.\par \par \uc2 ''It was given to William D. Simmons, a member of the White House staff, by Eleanor Roosevelt as a gift for such long service to Franklin Roosevelt,'' Mr. Gillis said.\par \par \uc2 But how could a buyer be sure that a particular American flag really flew over Hyde Park?\par \par \uc2 In this case, Mr. Gillis acquired the flag from descendants of Mr. Simmons. But he and other dealers stressed the importance of knowing where something came from. ''Provenance is everything in this business,'' he said.\par \par \uc2 The financial return on any of these artifacts is hard to say. M. S. Rau will give someone 5 percent over the purchase price per year for the first five years after an item is bought, and then 125 percent of the purchase price after that.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Bridgman said he recently brokered a private sale of a flag from Lincoln's second presidential campaign with his image and slogans on it. The flag fetched over $500,000, he said. But campaign flags of William Henry Harrison or Zachary Taylor sell for as little as $5,000.\par \par \uc2 ''Lincoln is always the most expensive,'' Mr. Bridgman said. ''He's so popular that he crosses categories of collectors.''\par \par \uc2 Buttons are a lot like stamps: Limited supply and little oddities increase the value.\par \par \uc2 Rarer items may increase more in price but there are naturally fewer buyers for them. Mr. Berg said he paid $60,000 for his Emancipation Proclamation pen five years ago and thought that was a deal.\par \par \uc2 ''I thought it was more valuable, but other people didn't agree with me and I was able to buy it for what I did,'' he said. ''I'd rather have unique and important, and important isn't always valuable.''\par \par \uc2 Some unique items will take longer to sell, like a land certificate signed by John Quincy Adams, for a tract in Zanesville, Ohio, on April 1, 1826. The price is $8,850. ''Someone is going to buy this, but it's going to be someone from Ohio or someone in the real estate business,'' Mr. Gillis said of the piece, which he's had for over a year.\par \par \uc2 But for others, no amount of money would be enough to sell. ''These pieces are very important to me,'' Mr. Cacchione said of his Reagan memorabilia. ''I not only helped create them but they became world renowned. I'm very proud to have this collection.''\par \par \uc2 That, more so than money, is the main driver for any collector.\par \par \uc2 Brandy snifters are among items in a collection of presidential memorabilia owned by Bob Cacchione, bottom photo.; Morris Offit, above, chairman of Offit Capital, said his interest in presidential collecting started when he saw American flags with different arrays of stars at an antiques fair.

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  raised more than $40 million for her presidential campaign in June, a healthy sum as the presumptive Democratic nominee seeks to maintain her overwhelming fund-raising and organizational advantage against \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 Clinton\uc2  campaign said Friday that it was beginning July with more than $44 million in cash on hand, as it starts to advertise heavily in battleground states in an attempt to define the race against Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , who has not challenged Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  on the airwaves. He began June with only $1.3 million cash on hand and has focused in recent weeks on adding to his coffers.\par \par \uc2 Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  also raised about $28 million for the \uc2 Democratic National Committee\uc2  and state parties, her campaign said.\par \par \uc2 ''Our first month of general \uc2 election\uc2  fund-raising proved to be the best of the campaign,'' Robby Mook, Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's campaign manager, said in a statement. ''Thanks to the continued support of nearly 1.6 million people, we have been able to help Democrats build out an organizing infrastructure across the country that will mobilize millions of voters and help elect progressive candidates up and down the ballot.''\par \par \uc2 To date, the campaign said, Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  has raised about $288 million for the campaign and $90 million for the national committee and state parties.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's campaign has not released June fund-raising numbers, which do not have to be officially reported to the \uc2 Federal \uc2 Election\uc2  Commission\uc2  until later this month.\par \par \uc2 Find out what you need to know about the 2016 presidential race today, and get politics news updates via \uc2 Facebook\uc2 , \uc2 Twitter\uc2  and the First Draft newsletter.\par \par \uc2 Document NYTF000020160702ec7200047\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

Waits for \uc2 Trump\uc2  to Grow Up'' (Op-Ed, June 30):\par \par \uc2 Nicolle Wallace is right that Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  will not change his style before the convention and then the \uc2 election\uc2 . But the Republican Party has a much more fundamental problem by standing with him. Its unspoken assumption is that just about anyone is qualified to be president as long as he learns to behave like a president.\par \par \uc2 Even if Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  ceases his racist, divisive talk and stops promoting his clearly unworkable solutions, he should have already disqualified himself. Anyone who is willing to use racism and fearmongering to achieve power is unfit, even if he stops for a few months.\par \par \uc2 Anyone who is willing to consider building walls at the border and barring people from entry because of their religion is unfit, even if he can rebrand himself by Nov. 8.\par \par \uc2 FREDRIC MASLIN\par \par \uc2 Fairfax, Calif.\par \par \uc2 Document NYTF000020160702ec7200035\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2  is adding two women to his team on his presidential efforts for the general \uc2 election\uc2 , a shift for a campaign whose upper echelons have been dominated by men.\par \par \uc2 Kellyanne Conway, a veteran pollster and strategist with deep working ties to Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , will come on as a senior adviser to the campaign chairman, Paul Manafort, as well as a member of the expanding polling team led by the pollster Tony Fabrizio. to join his senior campaign team.\par \par \uc2 Another addition to the higher ranks is Karen Giorno, who worked on Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's team in Florida during the Republican primary there. She will now be a senior political adviser.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  has long solicited advice from Ms. Conway, a consultant often employed by conservatives, who has also worked with former House Speaker \uc2 Newt Gingrich\uc2 , \uc2 Gov. Mike Pence\uc2  of Indiana and as the president of the main ''super PAC'' supporting Senator Ted Cruz of Texas in the presidential primaries this year. She is often consulted by House and Senate candidates, and she has carved out a niche for her mining of data related to female voters.\par \par \uc2 ''Kellyanne is a tremendous asset to our rapidly expanding campaign team,'' Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  said in a statement. ''She is a data and messaging expert and terrific on TV. It is great to have her on board.''\par \par \uc2 Ms. Giorno's ascent reflects a new urgency within the campaign to bolster its chances in Florida, a pivotal battleground. Ms. Giorno is said to have earned the candidate's trust during and after the primary process.\par \par \uc2 ''She has done a tremendous job for me in Florida in the primary, which I won in a landslide, and I am certain we will win Florida again in the general \uc2 election\uc2 ,'' Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  said of Ms. Giorno.\par \par \uc2 The moves also reflect an effort by Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  to try to improve his standing among female voters in a general \uc2 election\uc2  featuring the first female Democratic presidential nominee.\par \par \uc2 Find out what you need to know about the 2016 presidential race today, and get politics news updates via \uc2 Facebook\uc2 , \uc2 Twitter\uc2  and the First Draft newsletter.\par \par \uc2 Document NYTF000020160702ec7200030\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 National Desk; SECT\par \b \uc2 More Upheaval on \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2 's Team as Two Staff Members Resign\b0\par\par\uc2 By ASHLEY PARKER and MAGGIE HABERMAN \par \uc2 428 \uc2 words\par \uc2 2 July 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 The New York Times on the Web\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's campaign experienced two more departures this week when two staff members who handled surrogate operations resigned, including one who was hired less than two weeks ago.\par \par \uc2 Kevin Kellems, who was hired on June 20 to oversee the campaign's surrogate division -- supporters on the team who defend Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  and promote his message publicly -- resigned on Thursday, and Erica Freeman, who similarly dealt with surrogates, also quit.\par \par \uc2 In his resignation letter, which was shared with some staff members, Mr. Kellems acknowledged just how short his stint with the campaign had been.\par \par \uc2 ''While brief, it has been an interesting experience, and am proud of the contributions made through our early-phase project endeavors,'' wrote Mr. Kellems, who advised former House Speaker \uc2 Newt Gingrich\uc2  during his 2012 presidential campaign and also served as the communications director for former Vice President Dick Cheney.\par \par \uc2 He added: ''Also have enjoyed meeting some fine and dedicated individuals throughout the organization. Look forward to running across several of you going forward.''\par \par \uc2 Mr. Kellems was said to have been frustrated with the dysfunction of the campaign's senior leadership. Though Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  fired \uc2 Corey Lewandowski\uc2 , his divisive campaign manager, nearly two weeks ago, some close to the campaign remain irritated over what they view as the team's pronounced struggles to overhaul its operation.\par \par \uc2 Ms. Freeman had similarly found herself caught up in the chaos of the \uc2 Trump\uc2  operation. At one point, the turmoil spilled into public view when Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  publicly contradicted her on a conference call with surrogates. In the call, reported by Bloomberg News, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  referred to talking points Ms. Freeman had sent around -- urging supporters to stop talking about a federal lawsuit against \uc2 Trump\uc2  University -- and ordered, ''Take that order and throw it the hell out.''\par \par \uc2 The departures of the two aides underscore the disorder that continues in the \uc2 Trump\uc2  campaign, as the presumptive Republican nominee and his team struggle to grow into a professional, streamlined operation equipped to handle a general \uc2 election\uc2  against \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 On Thursday, the campaign also let go Vincent Harris, a digital consultant, who had similarly been hired less than a week before.\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 Trump\uc2  campaign declined to comment, but an aide briefed on the departures said there would be ''structural improvements'' coming soon to the team.\par \par \uc2 Find out what you need to know about the 2016 presidential race today, and get politics news updates via \uc2 Facebook\uc2 , \uc2 Twitter\uc2  and the First Draft newsletter.\par \par \uc2 Document NYTF000020160702ec720002z\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw272\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4080\pichgoal600

\par\par \b \uc2 Election\uc2  2016: \uc2 Trump\uc2  Is Tested in the West --- Colorado poses hurdles for the Republican, but there are signs of thaw with the state GOP\b0\par\par\uc2 By Beth Reinhard   \par \uc2 627 \uc2 words\par \uc2 1 July 2016\par \uc2 The Wall Street Journal\par \uc2 J\par A4\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 DENVER -- If there is a presidential battleground state that encompasses all of \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2 's challenges, it's Colorado.\par \par \uc2 The Republican candidate hasn't campaigned here, aside from touching down for a debate last year in Boulder. He hired a state director only this week, two months after Democratic presumptive nominee \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  began building her team. He didn't win any delegates at the state's spring Republican convention.\par \par \uc2 What's more, Colorado hosts one of the nation's largest Hispanic populations, a group that national polls show are resistant to Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's candidacy. A few blocks from where the businessman is scheduled to speak Friday, liberal groups are planning to erect a 9-by-30-foot, temporary barrier to protest his proposed wall between the U.S. and Mexico.\par \par \uc2 "I would not call Colorado unfriendly territory. I'd call it unknown territory," said Republican consultant \uc2 Patrick Davis\uc2 , Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's new state director.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  is undaunted. "I think I'm going to be great in Colorado," he said in an interview this week.\par \par \uc2 Despite all his hurdles, a recent CBS News/YouGov poll found Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  and Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  essentially tied in the state, which is likely among a dozen of the most competitive in November. President \uc2 Barack Obama\uc2  carried Colorado twice after the state for years mostly favored the Republican nominee.\par \par \uc2 Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  and her allies have invested almost $3 million in advertising in Colorado, according to SMG Delta/NBC News, while Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  hasn't spent any money. Mr. Davis noted that Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's primary challenger, Sen. Bernie Sanders, beat her at the Democratic state party convention, "so she has work to do here as well."\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  has had a strained relationship with the state's GOP since April, when Sen. Ted Cruz outmaneuvered him at party meetings to sweep all 34 delegates to the Cleveland convention.\par \par \uc2 "The people of Colorado had their vote taken away from them by the phony politicians. Biggest story in politics. This will not be allowed!" Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  posted on \uc2 Twitter\uc2  in April.\par \par \uc2 The state's Republican U.S. senator, Cory Gardner, dismissed Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's complaint as a "temper tantrum" on \uc2 Twitter\uc2 . A spokesman for the senator, who backed Mr. Cruz after Florida Sen. Marco Rubio dropped out of the race, didn't respond to requests for his current view of Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's campaign.\par \par \uc2 There are signs the \uc2 Colorado GOP\uc2  is warming to Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 . Three of the most prominent Republicans -- beer executive Pete Coors, former Denver Broncos coach Mike Shanahan and Larry Mizell, a major party donor -- are co-hosting a fundraiser for Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  on Friday. One of Mr. Cruz's delegates is organizing a pro-\uc2 Trump\uc2  rally Friday at the state capitol.\par \par \uc2 Still, the region has proved difficult for Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , who also lost contests in Idaho, Wyoming and Utah.\par \par \uc2 "This is the Mountain West, which was not a strong area for him in the primary so he's got to come in here and convince people he will support the kind of lifestyle they want to live," said Colorado Republican Party chairman Steve House, noting his voters are "conservative, free-thinking, outdoors-sort-of-people but also very evangelical."\par \par \uc2 Republican congressional candidate George Athanasopoulos, who is seeking to oust a Democrat representing the Denver suburbs, was a Cruz supporter who switched to Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  in June.\par \par \uc2 "There is a strong anti-\uc2 Trump\uc2  movement among conservatives in Colorado, and if we have any chance of winning in November, we absolutely must unite," he said.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=wjco20160701000053"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document J000000020160831ec710000n\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw272\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4080\pichgoal600

\par\par \b \uc2 Election\uc2  2016: Airport Meeting Spurs Criticism\b0\par\par\uc2 By Peter Nicholas and Devlin Barrett   \par \uc2 502 \uc2 words\par \uc2 1 July 2016\par \uc2 The Wall Street Journal\par \uc2 J\par A4\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 Bill \uc2 Clinton\uc2  initiated the private visit with Attorney General Loretta Lynch at the Phoenix airport this week after hearing that her plane was on the same tarmac, people familiar with the matter said, a decision that has created a distraction for his wife's presidential campaign.\par \par \uc2 The former president was in his vehicle heading to his plane to depart Phoenix when he heard through aides that Ms. Lynch and her staff were on the ground nearby. He said he wanted to stop and say hello.\par \par \uc2 The conversation lasted about 20 minutes and included Ms. Lynch's husband.\par \par \uc2 Ms. Lynch was in Phoenix as part of a series of meetings with local police departments, while Mr. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  had taken part in a fundraising event in the city that day while on a seven-state fundraising tour.\par \par \uc2 The visit between Mr. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  and Ms. Lynch has touched off bipartisan criticism, given that she will have the final say on whether the government brings charges against anyone in a \uc2 Federal Bureau of Investigation\uc2  criminal probe into Democratic presidential candidate \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's email practices at the State Department. Any charges have the potential to upend the presidential race.\par \par \uc2 FBI\uc2  agents have already interviewed senior aides who served with Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  at the State Department. They plan to interview her in the coming weeks, officials said.\par \par \uc2 Ms. Lynch told reporters in Phoenix on Tuesday that she and Mr. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  didn't discuss the email matter. Rather, they talked about grandchildren, their travels and Britain's vote to exit from the \uc2 European Union\uc2 , she said.\par \par \uc2 At the White House on Thursday, press secretary \uc2 Josh Earnest\uc2  declined to weigh in on whether Ms. Lynch's conversation with Mr. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  was appropriate. But Mr. Earnest expressed confidence in the attorney general's commitment to ensuring that the administration's work is guided by facts and not by politics.\par \par \uc2 Prominent Democrats supporting Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  said the visit was a mistake. David Axelrod, a former senior strategist to President \uc2 Barack Obama\uc2 's two winning presidential bids, tweeted that he accepts that Mr. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  and Ms. Lynch didn't talk about "the probe." He added: "But foolish to create such optics."\par \par \uc2 The episode in Phoenix shows that a misstep by Mr. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  can prove costly. While Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  would like the email controversy to subside, the visit has served to remind voters of the \uc2 FBI\uc2  inquiry.\par \par \uc2 Friends of Mr. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  said he is a gregarious soul who doesn't often pass up chances to greet people he knows. In 1999, Mr. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  named Ms. Lynch the U.S. attorney for New York's Eastern District.\par \par \uc2 James Carville, a senior strategist in Mr. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's 1992 campaign, said: "He talks to anybody! He's not the kind of guy who's going to see someone in politics he knows and not stop to talk to him."\par \par \uc2 ---\par \par \uc2 Colleen McCain Nelson contributed to this article.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=wjco20160701000052"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document J000000020160831ec710000m\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw272\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4080\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 REVIEW & OUTLOOK (Editorial)\par \b \uc2 Progressives Target the Press\b0\par\par\uc2 536 \uc2 words\par \uc2 1 July 2016\par \uc2 The Wall Street Journal\par \uc2 J\par A10\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 Democrats and progressives are running a campaign to turn the \uc2 Federal \uc2 Election\uc2  Commission\uc2  into a partisan regulator. For a preview of what that would mean, consider this close call against Fox News.\par \par \uc2 In a 3-3 May decision released Thursday, the \uc2 FEC\uc2  rejected a complaint that Fox News violated campaign laws with its campaign coverage. But three Democratic commissioners voted in favor and two would have penalized Fox (which hosts a weekly show by Journal editors). By design the \uc2 FEC\uc2  must gather a bipartisan majority for enforcement decisions, so a deadlock prevents the Commission from acting.\par \par \uc2 The story started in August 2015 as Fox News prepared to host a Republican presidential debate. The network planned a single debate with 10 contenders, but with the field still fluid it decided to add an "undercard" debate with seven more candidates.\par \par \uc2 That enraged \uc2 Mark Everson\uc2 , a candidate you may not have heard of who wasn't invited to the debate. Mr. Everson filed a complaint with the \uc2 FEC\uc2 , arguing that the expanded format was an illegal corporate contribution to candidates in violation of the Federal \uc2 Election\uc2  Campaign Act. Under the theory embraced by the three Democrats, the \uc2 FEC\uc2  may regulate media engaged in core editorial functions.\par \par \uc2 We kid you not. A report by the FEC's First General Counsel, whose reasoning guided the Democrats, notes that the Federal \uc2 Election\uc2  Campaign Act requires a broadcaster to use "pre-established objective criteria" to structure its debates. By exercising editorial discretion and expanding the field to give voters more exposure to candidates, they said, the network violated campaign law.\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 FEC\uc2  is charged with overseeing political contributions and expenditures, but that function does not include the power to meddle in or otherwise censor the editorial decisions of newsrooms. FEC Commissioner Lee Goodman, one of the three Republicans to object, notes that the FCC "long ago resolved that a broadcast station's staging and moderating of a debate is 'news coverage.'" There is thus no legal difference between interviewing one candidate or four or 20.\par \par \uc2 Democratic FEC Commissioner \uc2 Ellen Weintraub\uc2  has since said she "did not think Fox did anything wrong" and that she wouldn't have punished them for expanding the debate, though that doesn't explain why she joined Democrats in the 3-3 vote on the merits.\par \par \uc2 The Federal \uc2 Election\uc2  Campaign Act bars corporations from donating to federal candidates, but it specifies that this doesn't apply to "any news story, commentary, or editorial distributed through the facilities of any broadcasting station," as long as the facilities or station aren't owned by a political party.\par \par \uc2 Liberals were once champions of a free press, but those values go wobbly when the press is conservative. Senate Democrats, led by New York's Chuck Schumer, are pushing for an \uc2 election\uc2  year fight to amend the First Amendment and change the \uc2 FEC\uc2  to prevent the 3-3 deadlocks that were designed to protect against one party wielding campaign regulation as a political weapon.\par \par \uc2 Maybe Democrats should think about how \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2 's appointees might treat \uc2 CNN\uc2  or MSNBC if their scheme to pack the \uc2 FEC\uc2  became reality.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=wjco20160701000122"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document J000000020160829ec710003d\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw272\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4080\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 The Price of Prosperity\par \par \uc2 By Todd G. Buchholz\par \par \uc2 Harper, 367 pages, $29.99\par \par \uc2 Judging from the heavy voting for "outsiders" Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  and Bernie Sanders, Americans are in a bloodless revolt against their government. Opinion polls suggest widespread anxiety about the nation's future -- a concern that we are on the "wrong track."\par \par \uc2 In "The Price of Prosperity: Why Rich Nations Fail and How to Renew Them, " Todd Buchholz writes that the anxiety is justified, that "nations are just as likely to unravel after periods of prosperity as after periods of depression." He calls the process "entropy," a term drawn from the study of thermodynamics. Roughly translated into the vernacular, it means a descent into disorder and chaos.\par \par \uc2 The author sees in America five entropic forces that can "shatter even a rich nation." They are, as he lists them: falling birthrates; globalized trade; rising debt loads; an eroding work ethic; and "the challenge of patriotism in a multicultural country."\par \par \uc2 Each claim is expansive enough to merit a long discussion, but briefly the argument is that as nations grow richer, birth rates fall, making nations more dependent on immigrant labor to sustain production and wealth. At the same time increased globalization causes dislocations that rob workers of a sense of security. The resulting cultural conflicts and anxiety sow disaffection, weakening the unifying power of patriotism.\par \par \uc2 Coupled with these forces are the debilitating effects of excessive debt and government-subsidized idleness. Mr. Buchholz contrasts the liberal Social Security and Medicare funds going to today's retiring baby boomer -- $327,000 in excess of what he paid in federal taxes -- with what a newborn can expect: "She will pay $421,000 more in federal taxes than she will ever receive in future benefits."\par \par \uc2 As to the work ethic, Mr. Buchholz wryly observes that when rich nations begin to shatter, "everyone has a comfy bed -- but fewer people have a reason to get out of it." He cites the rising number of early retirees and a doubling of the number of people who have quit their jobs and filed for disability benefits since 1995.\par \par \uc2 What is to be done? The author argues that "if a nation wants to survive the gale forces of a swiftly changing economy, it had better convey to its children and to its immigrants a sense of its national character and the rituals and stories that can hold it together." To restore that sense he proposes requiring that all applicants for citizenship or green-card permanent residency have their passports stamped at no fewer than five historical museums, libraries or landmarks, such as the Gettysburg battlefield or Philadelphia's Independence Hall. He would impose a similar requirement on anyone applying for a student loan.\par \par \uc2 More substantively, retirees should get a raise only if the nation's debt situation improves. The jobless should be given more incentives to find work, such as "mobility credits" for moving to another state to take a job. The list goes on. Readers can decide if these proposals are powerful or practical enough to cope with an "entropy" as devastating as the one the author envisions.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Buchholz was economic adviser to George H.W. Bush. He has run a hedge fund. He teaches and writes books and is popular with TV talk-show hosts. His book reflects that range of talents in that it has the tone of a provocative and entertaining dinner speech, studded with factoids and witticisms. Acknowledging the bias that earlier generations could feel toward new groups, he notes that Benjamin Franklin disliked Germans and found even Swedes swarthy: "Clearly," he writes, "he did not foresee a never-ending road tour of screaming blondes in Abba's Mamma Mia." Quotes from Woody Allen, Robert De Niro and other celebrities pop up. He does riffs on history's great unifiers, Israel's Golda Meir, Turkey's Ataturk and Alexander the Great. Old-fashioned verities like hard work, honesty and love of country are extolled.\par \par \uc2 The result is entertaining and informative but a bit glib. For example, rising wealth does indeed correlate with falling birth rates, but it's not quite that simple. Some poor countries, Cuba and Belarus, for example, have lower fertility rates than some of the richest ones. Mr. Buchholz argues that the U.S. "no longer coheres. We have a thousand television channels, 1 billion web sites and 330 million citizens with no reason to listen to each other." Communications technology has indeed changed the world, but is it true that America no longer coheres? Anyone with a computer or smartphone has direct access not only to family and friends in distant places but also to an almost endless amount of published information. All sorts of subcultures and affinity groups cohere nicely without fostering strife or dissolution. Whatever one thinks of the \uc2 election\uc2  results so far, there's no lack of public interest and involvement.\par \par \uc2 The bubbling up of immigrant- and trade-bashing is disturbing and suggests rising, not declining, nationalism. Mr. Buchholz makes it clear that he understands the vital importance of trade. But if protectionists misunderstand his point that the dislocations caused by trade can "crumble loyalties," they may feel vindicated by his argument, however misguidedly. Trade stagnation costs more jobs than trade dislocations and can "crumble loyalties" a lot faster.\par \par \uc2 Nonetheless, Mr. Buchholz has raised his warning flags in a charming way. If his aim was to further excite our national anxieties, I'm not sure he succeeds. He has too much good humor to be a wholly effective doomsayer.\par \par \uc2 ---\par \par \uc2 Mr. Melloan, a former columnist and deputy editor of the Journal editorial page, is author of "When the New Deal Came to Town," to be published by \uc2 Simon & Schuster\uc2  this fall.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=wjco20160701000119"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document J000000020160829ec710003a\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

That country's leaders are smarter than those in the United States, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee said.\par \par \uc2 Then, as the sound of a plane overhead drowned out his voice, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  went off his script.\par \par \uc2 ''In fact,'' Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  said, pointing his finger toward the sky, ''that could be a Mexican plane up there. They're getting ready to attack.''\par \par \uc2 The comment was reminiscent of the shoot-from-the-lip style that was a hallmark of his insurgent primary campaign, rather than the more scripted and disciplined approach he has sought to take in recent weeks after a series of remarks entangled him in controversy as he began his general \uc2 election\uc2  bid.\par \par \uc2 But as Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  moves to be more of the conventional candidate that many Republicans hope he will be, there is a concern among many in the party that no matter how much Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's aides try to harness his message, there are limits to how much he will adjust.\par \par \uc2 The appearance on Thursday was the type Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  largely avoided during the New Hampshire primary campaign -- a small event, about 150 people, focused on a specific issue, with questions from the audience. The setting was the old Osram Sylvania lighting manufacturing plant in Manchester, and the topic was trade, an issue on which Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  has been consistent over many years, denouncing an imbalance with countries like China and Japan.\par \par \uc2 The event was hastily thrown together after a major speech that Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  gave on the issue had been overshadowed by the terrorist attack at Istanbul's main airport. The campaign could not get permission to use the plant itself, which was gutted after closing in 2014, so Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  spoke outdoors, in the blazing sun, with temperatures climbing toward 90 degrees.\par \par \uc2 Corey Lewandowski\uc2 , the campaign manager who had championed a ''let \uc2 Trump\uc2  be \uc2 Trump\uc2 '' approach and whom Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  fired less than two weeks ago, showed up at the speech, startling reporters. It wasn't clear whether Mr. Lewandowski, a New Hampshire resident, had met with Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  praised himself for holding an event attended by people he described as ''totally unvetted.'' Then he made a word association: ''And speaking of unvetted, we're going to take care of our vets.''\par \par \uc2 New Hampshire and Maine, both overwhelmingly white, are places where Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  is focusing his time. New Hampshire, in particular, is a favorite -- the state that handed him a comeback win in February after a loss in the Iowa caucuses. Since Mr. Lewandowski's departure, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  has tried to make a sustained case to anti-trade voters who backed him as well as Senator Bernie Sanders in the Democratic race, tossing aside decades of Republican deference to trade agreements and the business community.\par \par \uc2 Throughout the event on Thursday, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  tossed off a list of numbers and facts about the manufacturing losses in New Hampshire, another departure from his approach when Mr. Lewandowski managed the campaign.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  seemed mostly at ease with the new stage of his campaign. He put the blame for the budget deficit squarely on Bill and \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , faulting the North American Free Trade Act of 1994 for jobs leaving the country.\par \par \uc2 ''It's incredible, when you take a look at the devastation that took place in New York and Pennsylvania and Connecticut,'' Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  said, ''devastation caused mostly by Nafta.''\par \par \uc2 But a spokesman for Osram Sylvania told The Associated Press that the plant closing was unrelated to Nafta or any other trade deals.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  also predicted an uptick in the price of goods with more limited trade, but suggested that was a compromise for keeping jobs.\par \par \uc2 Many in the crowd were wilting in their gray plastic folding chairs by the time he turned to questions. One man, Warren Goddard of Portsmouth, asked two -- one pressing Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  on abortion, which Mr. Goddard called ''murder,'' and another that diminished Israel.\par \par \uc2 ''We are going to protect Israel 100 percent,'' Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  replied, calling that question ''nasty.'' He declined to use the word ''abortion,'' saying only, ''As to No. 1, we all -- we're with you.''\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , whose aides have tried to prod him toward a clarification of his proposed ban on Muslim immigrants, told a woman who asked about using veterans to replace ethnic \uc2 Transportation Security Administration\uc2  workers wearing ''heebeejabbies,'' an apparent reference to Muslim women's scarves, that he was ''looking at that. We're looking at a lot of things.''\par \par \uc2 And as he wrapped up, the candidate offered a reminder of how challenging he can be for his handlers. Shoving aside the notes he had been using, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  said: ''I don't really need those notes, because I don't need notes. Aren't I lucky?''\par \par \uc2 ''Nice to have that ability, isn't it?'' he said. ''It's a good ability to have.''\par \par \uc2 Find out what you need to know about the 2016 presidential race today, and get politics news updates via \uc2 Facebook\uc2 , \uc2 Twitter\uc2  and the First Draft newsletter.\par \par \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2  pointing to a plane at a campaign event in Manchester, N.H., on Thursday.

\par\par \uc2 OP-ED COLUMNIST\par \uc2 Editorial Desk; SECTA\par \b \uc2 The Coming Political Realignment\b0\par\par\uc2 By DAVID BROOKS \par \uc2 877 \uc2 words\par \uc2 1 July 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 23\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  has done something politically smart and substantively revolutionary. He is a Republican presidential candidate running against free trade and, effectively, free markets.\par \par \uc2 By putting trade at the top of the conversation he elevates the issue on which \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  is the most squirrelly, where her position reinforces the message that she will say anything to get power.\par \par \uc2 But mostly it's politically smart because \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2 's only shot of winning the presidency is to smash and replace the entire structure of the American political debate. For the past 80 years that debate has been about the size of government -- Republicans for less government and more market and Democrats for more government and less market.\par \par \uc2 If that debate structures this \uc2 election\uc2 , \uc2 Trump\uc2  will get somewhere between 38 and 44 percent of the votes -- where he's been polling all year.\par \par \uc2 Trump\uc2 's only hope is to change the debate from size of government to open/closed. His only hope is to cast his opponents as the right-left establishment that supports open borders, free trade, cosmopolitan culture and global intervention. He would stand as a right-left populist who supports closed borders, trade barriers, local and nationalistic culture and an America First foreign policy.\par \par \uc2 In an age of anxiety, that closed posture might have a shot at winning. On trade, for example, 60 percent of Republicans, 49 percent of Democrats and 50 percent of independents believe that trade agreements are mostly harmful, according to a Brookings Institution/Public Religion Research Institute study.\par \par \uc2 I personally doubt that \uc2 Trump\uc2  will be able to pull off a right-left populist coalition. His views on women and minorities are unacceptable to nearly everybody on the left. There's no evidence that he's winning over many Sanders voters or downscale progressives.\par \par \uc2 But where \uc2 Trump\uc2  fails, somebody else will succeed. And that's where he's substantively revolutionary. The old size-of-government question was growing increasingly archaic and obsolete. In country after country the main battle lines of debate are evolving toward the open/closed framework.\par \par \uc2 If you don't like our current political polarization, wait 10 years. One way or another it will go away. When the frame of debate shifts to open/closed, sometime soon, the old coalitions will smash apart and new ones will form. Politics will be unrecognizable.\par \par \uc2 It's significant that \uc2 Trump\uc2  gave his big anti-trade speech in the Pittsburgh area. That part of Western Pennsylvania illustrates in a very concrete way how the open/closed debate will play out.\par \par \uc2 Pittsburgh is a great renaissance story. I recently got a tour of it from the mayor, Bill Peduto. We visited a beautiful, tight Italian community with family-owned businesses stretching back generations. We visited a resurging African-American community where local activists were building a cultural center in the home of the great playwright August Wilson. Mostly we just saw acres and acres of new development: new restaurants, new museums, new loft-style office spaces and several gleaming new hospitals.\par \par \uc2 Pittsburgh has come so far from the deindustrialization days of the 1970s and 1980s.\par \par \uc2 But then I drove through the steel mill towns along the Monongahela and other rivers. The storefronts and banks were boarded up, the downtowns deserted. The mills are still operating, but they are so efficient they're eerily empty of human presence. The towns still have residents, but not much is going on. I drove for miles, unable to find even a diner for lunch.\par \par \uc2 It occurred to me the Pittsburgh renaissance didn't really grow up out of the metro Pittsburgh of old. Instead one \uc2 Carnegie-Mellon\uc2  type layer of prosperity and innovation had grown on top of the old working-class layer, which was still there and in bad shape.\par \par \uc2 When you're in the top layer you see why free trade is so good. Living standards are rising. A study by the Peterson Institute found that past trade liberalization laws added between $7,100 to 12,900 in additional income to the average household. A study by Peter Petri and Michael Plummer estimates that the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which \uc2 Trump\uc2  opposes and \uc2 Clinton\uc2  sort of opposes, would boost American incomes by $131 billion.\par \par \uc2 You also see how an efficient manufacturing sector makes it possible to divert resources into things that improve the quality of life. As Neil Irwin pointed out in The Times, Pittsburgh has lost 5,100 steel jobs since 1990. But it has also gained 66,000 health care jobs over the same time.\par \par \uc2 The problem is getting people from the bottom layer to the top layer -- a 30-minute drive, but a universe away.\par \par \uc2 The prophets of closedness will argue that the problem is trade. The prophets of openness will argue that we need the dynamism that free trade brings. We just need to be more aggressive in equipping people to thrive in that dynamic landscape. If facts still matter in this debate -- and I'm not sure they do -- the proponents of openness are massively right.\par \par \uc2 Follow The \uc2 New York Times\uc2  Opinion section on \uc2 Facebook\uc2  and \uc2 Twitter\uc2  (@NYTOpinion), and sign up for the Opinion Today newsletter.\par \par \uc2 Paul Krugman is off today.\par \par \uc2 Document NYTF000020160701ec710003m\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 National Desk; SECTA\par \b \uc2 Standing Tall Behind \uc2 Trump\uc2 , Christie Plays Influential Role\b0\par\par\uc2 By ALEXANDER BURNS and MAGGIE HABERMAN \par \uc2 1,468 \uc2 words\par \uc2 1 July 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 1\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Defeated by \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2  in the 2016 primaries and derided by fellow Republicans for his subsequent embrace of Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , \uc2 Gov. Chris Christie\uc2  of New Jersey has quietly emerged as one of the most influential advisers to his party's presumptive presidential nominee and one of the leading contenders to be his running mate.\par \par \uc2 Four months after endorsing Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , Mr. Christie remains one of the few major figures in the Republican establishment to align himself entirely with Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's candidacy. In public, he has defended Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's freewheeling and sometimes offensive pronouncements, vouching for him even after Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  attacked a federal judge for his Mexican heritage. (Mr. Christie said he knew from personal experience that Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  was not a racist.)\par \par \uc2 Mr. Christie is among those being vetted as Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's possible running mate, according to people briefed on the process, and Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  has said in interviews that Mr. Christie would have a prominent place in a \uc2 Trump\uc2  White House.\par \par \uc2 Already, Mr. Christie has begun the task of designing a government on Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's behalf. Chosen to lead Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's transition efforts, Mr. Christie has taken a role that some of his allies liken to that of a White House chief of staff, soliciting views on what a potential administration should look like.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Christie has taken the transition process firmly in hand, according to people familiar with his activities. He has enlisted his former top aide in Trenton, Richard H. Bagger, to help manage the transition team.\par \par \uc2 On a conference call with several dozen of Mr. Christie's political allies on Thursday afternoon, he and Mr. Bagger said they aimed to have a long list of possible appointees drawn up for Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  by the time of the \uc2 election\uc2 . And they outlined plans to fund their early preparations through a nonprofit group, people briefed on the plans said, and asked for help raising money until they receive government support after the July conventions for their transition efforts.\par \par \uc2 Behind the scenes, Mr. Christie has prodded his fellow governors and Republican political donors to line up behind a candidate many view with distaste. He has made only modest headway in the last few months: Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  has struggled badly with fund-raising, and Mr. Christie has pleaded with donors in personal phone calls and at fund-raising events to give him a second look.\par \par \uc2 At a breakfast fund-raiser in Manhattan last week, Mr. Christie cajoled reluctant donors to back Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , arguing that giving anything less than enthusiastic support would be a de facto vote for \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 And he has prodded Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , too, to shift direction at key moments: Mr. Christie was among the senior Republicans who privately urged Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  to dismiss his campaign manager, \uc2 Corey Lewandowski\uc2 , who was widely distrusted by national party leaders and other members of the \uc2 Trump\uc2  inner circle.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Christie's new role is a stark transformation from a boastfully independent blue-state politician determined to win over female, Hispanic and Asian voters, to the right-hand man of the most culturally polarizing presidential candidate in a generation.\par \par \uc2 Politically, it represents a drastic gamble for Mr. Christie, a wager that he will be better off as a loyal and often-mocked footman for an unpopular nominee than as a sulking former opponent plotting his eventual comeback. Should Mr. Christie seek the presidency again, he would probably be identified -- for better or worse -- not as a leader of the mainstream Republican Party, but as a champion of Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's faction.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Christie has also acknowledged to friends that Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  seized much of the political space Mr. Christie had hoped to occupy in his own presidential run -- that of a blunt leader with an expansive media profile and a forceful message on terrorism.\par \par \uc2 But some Republicans are disheartened by Mr. Christie's integration into the \uc2 Trump\uc2  machinery, seeing it as a lost opportunity to build a more inclusive Republican Party this \uc2 election\uc2  year. Joel Maiola, a New Hampshire strategist who helped steer Mr. Christie's campaign in the state, said he had been ''confused and not overly happy'' about Mr. Christie's involvement in the \uc2 Trump\uc2  operation.\par \par \uc2 ''I think he's been diminished by the way the \uc2 Trump\uc2  organization has used him, and I think that's really unfortunate,'' Mr. Maiola said. He described Mr. Christie's efforts to unite the party behind Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  as largely futile because of Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's divisive approach to the presidential race.\par \par \uc2 ''He just seems to blow up the efforts that Governor Christie has been making to sort of form those alliances and form those bridges,'' Mr. Maiola said.\par \par \uc2 A spokesman for Mr. Christie declined to comment on his involvement with the \uc2 Trump\uc2  campaign or to make Mr. Christie available for an interview.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  has been outwardly receptive to Mr. Christie's coaching. The two men describe each other as friends with an acquaintance dating back 15 years, to early in Mr. Christie's political career. Even during their clash in the Republican primaries, Mr. Christie spoke warmly of Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  as a friend; as an endorser, Mr. Christie has shown loyalty that has been noted with appreciation by Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  and his children.\par \par \uc2 And Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  has given credit to the governor for helping him win the Republican nomination. Addressing a fund-raiser in Manhattan last week, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  thanked Mr. Christie for his political advice and his sophisticated grasp of government -- and, perhaps most of all, for his part in demolishing Senator \uc2 Marco Rubio\uc2 's presidential campaign.\par \par \uc2 The New Jersey governor, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  said, gutted Mr. Rubio so thoroughly in a February debate that he was content simply to sit back and enjoy the show. He kidded Mr. Christie, ''Thank you, Chris, for being the bad guy,'' according to some in attendance who paraphrased Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's remarks.\par \par \uc2 But Mr. Christie's proximity to the possible next president has come at a price. And as a \uc2 Trump\uc2  advocate, he has also run up against the limits of his own influence.\par \par \uc2 Shortly after backing Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , Mr. Christie visited one of his close friends in politics, Gov. Larry Hogan of Maryland, in Annapolis. Over breakfast in the governor's mansion, Mr. Christie and Mr. Hogan discussed the presidential race, and Mr. Hogan made it clear that he did not share Mr. Christie's enthusiasm for Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Mr. Hogan is one of several Republican governors, including Charlie Baker of Massachusetts and Rick Snyder of Michigan, who have said they will not support Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 ''They've agreed to disagree on this particular issue, and there's no kind of confrontation,'' said Matthew A. Clark, a spokesman for Mr. Hogan. ''Governor Christie did not make any attempt to change Governor Hogan's mind.''\par \par \uc2 In New Jersey, Mr. Christie's already low approval ratings slipped further after he endorsed Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 . And on a more personal level, Mr. Christie has been routinely taunted by Democrats and more than a few fellow Republicans for his perceived obsequiousness around Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 A gregarious politician who routinely refers to other officeholders by their first names, Mr. Christie was pilloried in late February for referring to his friend as ''Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 '' in announcing his support. Soon after, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  was caught on a microphone in Arkansas curtly telling Mr. Christie that he should go home after having finished his remarks.\par \par \uc2 On the night of the March 1 primaries, Mr. Christie became the subject of internet memes featuring his seemingly vacant expression as he stood at Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's shoulder during his victory speech.\par \par \uc2 In June, Mr. Christie's staff flatly denied an account in \uc2 The New Yorker\uc2  that Mr. Christie had been captured on video fetching fast food for Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Mr. Christie has shrugged off any hard feelings about the mockery he draws on the campaign trail, but he has also recently stepped away from the stump and opted for a more discreet role.\par \par \uc2 Thomas H. Kean, a former New Jersey governor, said Mr. Christie had described himself as deeply involved in Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's activities. ''He was advising him on speeches; he's advising him on policies,'' Mr. Kean said.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Kean added: ''He's in a position to be a good adviser. Whether \uc2 Trump\uc2  will listen to him or not, I don't know.''\par \par \uc2 Find out what you need to know about the 2016 presidential race today, and get politics news updates via \uc2 Facebook\uc2 , \uc2 Twitter\uc2  and the First Draft newsletter.\par \par \uc2 Gov.

\par\par \uc2 Politics; SECT\par \b \uc2 Democratic Group Prepares Trove of Research to Unload on \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\b0\par\par\uc2 By MAGGIE HABERMAN and ASHLEY PARKER \par \uc2 362 \uc2 words\par \uc2 1 July 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 The New York Times on the Web\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 The opposition research group American Bridge made its mark in the 2012 \uc2 election\uc2  cycle with a video clip of a Missouri Senate candidate, Todd Akin, saying that ''legitimate rape'' rarely leads to pregnancy.\par \par \uc2 Republicans running in other states, as well as the presidential nominee, \uc2 Mitt Romney\uc2 , found themselves answering questions about him.\par \par \uc2 In 2016, the group is taking every opportunity to do the same thing with \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2 . It is maintaining an archive of digital video footage, with 6,500 clips of Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  speaking or being mentioned, going back to the 1980s, and 17,000 hours of footage over all. It has also compiled more than 5,000 pages of research on the presumptive Republican nominee and has 25 trackers monitoring him.\par \par \uc2 American Bridge is playing a more significant role in 2016 than it did in 2012, when the Obama campaign was leery of the group, which was founded by a close ally of \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's. This cycle, Democrats have relied on it openly for research.\par \par \uc2 There are special systems that allow it to search by specific strings of words to identify issue targets. It is trying to expedite their ability to quickly frame a case against Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 . And it is monitoring roughly 600 candidates up and down the ballot, in addition to Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 To be sure, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  has given his critics a wealth of material to work with: He is the most media-accessible presidential nominee in recent memory. The group has brought on experts in accessing public records in New York and Florida, where Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  has homes and does extensive business.\par \par \uc2 Their hope is to have Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  defined before he ever gets to reintroduce himself to the general \uc2 election\uc2  voters.\par \par \uc2 ''We're in a position to take on a candidate that's very different than anything we've ever seen before,'' said Jessica Mackler, the president of the group.\par \par \uc2 Find out what you need to know about the 2016 presidential race today, and get politics news updates via \uc2 Facebook\uc2 , \uc2 Twitter\uc2  and the First Draft newsletter.\par \par \uc2 Document NYTF000020160701ec710004k\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

Ms. Conway was the president of the leading ''super PAC'' supporting Senator Ted Cruz in the Republican nominating contests. She also did preliminary work for Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  when he considered a presidential campaign in 2011, and is expected to have a senior strategic role in this one.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's team is also expected to bring on Adam Geller, who works with \uc2 Gov. Chris Christie\uc2  of New Jersey, and Michael Baselice, who was the pollster for former Gov. Rick Perry of Texas and for the state's governor now, Greg Abbott.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  already has hired Tony Fabrizio, another veteran pollster, and John McLaughlin, who was brought on specifically to help Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  in New York.\par \par \uc2 A spokeswoman for Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  did not respond to a request -- and Ms. Conway, Mr. Geller and Mr. Baselice did not return calls -- seeking comment.\par \par \uc2 Find out what you need to know about the 2016 presidential race today, and get politics news updates via \uc2 Facebook\uc2 , \uc2 Twitter\uc2  and the First Draft newsletter.\par \par \uc2 Document NYTF000020160701ec710004p\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw272\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4080\pichgoal600

The agreement was finalized over the weekend, and the city officially adopted new rules Wednesday.\par \par \uc2 According to the new rules, Cleveland will shrink the "event zone" around the Quicken Loans Arena, where most of the Republican National Convention will be held next month; extend the hours where permitted marches will be allowed; and change the designated parade route -- which is for anyone who applies to use it -- so that it comes closer to where delegates will be.\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 ACLU\uc2  -- which had sued on behalf of three groups who said the city's restrictions on protests were "draconian" -- hailed the new plan as a victory for free speech.\par \par \uc2 Thousands of protesters are expected to descend on Cleveland for the GOP convention, which will be held July 18 to 21.\par \par \uc2 -- Byron Tau\par \par \uc2 ---\par \par \uc2 PRESIDENTIAL RACE\par \par \uc2 Trump\uc2  Is Urged to\par \par \uc2 Change Approach\par \par \uc2 Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  "needs to change" if he wants to beat Democrat \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  in November.\par \par \uc2 Mr. McConnell, who has criticized Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  since offering a wary endorsement for the candidate in May, said in an interview posted late Tuesday he hopes Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  continues to work to become "a more serious and credible candidate."\par \par \uc2 "What I've said to him both publicly and privately, 'You're a great entertainer. You turn on audiences. You're good before a crowd...That worked fine for you in the primaries. But now that you are in the general, people are looking for a level of seriousness that's typically conveyed by having a prepared text and teleprompter and staying on message,' " Mr. McConnell said in an interview with Time Warner Cable News in New York. He said Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  is "getting closer" to becoming credible.\par \par \uc2 During the primary season, Mr. McConnell denounced some of Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's more controversial positions, including his proposed ban on Muslim immigration to the U.S., but pledged to support his candidacy.\par \par \uc2 -- Julian Routh\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=wjco20160630000058"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document J000000020160827ec6u00005\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw272\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4080\pichgoal600

\par\par \b \uc2 Election\uc2  2016: \uc2 Trump\uc2  Adjusts Some of His Positions\b0\par\par\uc2 By Beth Reinhard   \par \uc2 668 \uc2 words\par \uc2 30 June 2016\par \uc2 The Wall Street Journal\par \uc2 J\par A4\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 In the two months since he sewed up the Republican nomination, \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  has blurred his positions on some key issues and tactics that helped him win more primary votes than any other GOP presidential candidate.\par \par \uc2 Among his promises during the primary: "a total and complete shutdown of Muslims," a wall along the southern border, and the deportation of millions of illegal immigrants. He opposed increasing the minimum wage and favored tax cuts for the wealthy.\par \par \uc2 His national-security policy now has shifted to blocking immigrants from countries with terrorist links. "I have never liked the media term 'mass deportation,' he said recently on \uc2 Twitter\uc2 , referring to people living in the U.S. illegally. And last month, he said he was "open" to state-level minimum-wage hikes and "flexible" on the size of tax cuts for affluent households. He hasn't wavered on the wall.\par \par \uc2 In an interview Wednesday, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  said he was "getting more specific, " not changing positions.\par \par \uc2 "I don't flip flop. I do what's right," he said.\par \par \uc2 It isn't a full-fledged "pivot" to the general \uc2 election\uc2  that several \uc2 Trump\uc2  allies predicted would make him more acceptable to the political establishment, but more of a lean.\par \par \uc2 "He's gone from severe rhetoric to staying pretty consistent but with a more thoughtful approach," said veteran Republican strategist \uc2 Ed Rollins\uc2 , who is working with a pro-\uc2 Trump\uc2  super PAC. "It's getting to be a more structured campaign, but it's not like he's switching positions on abortion and gun control."\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's vacillations could open the door to attacks that he isn't so different from the politicians he pilloried for soliciting money from Wall Street and using teleprompters. He is now doing both.\par \par \uc2 Still, his rhetoric at rallies remains as fiery as ever. "I like it a lot," Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  said of waterboarding at a rally Tuesday in Ohio, where he also said he had "shamed" Democrat \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  into reversing her position on the Trans-Pacific Partnership. She now opposes that trade deal after having backed it when she was secretary of state, and since her 2008 presidential campaign, Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  has shifted positions on other issues, such as same-sex marriage, which she now supports.\par \par \uc2 "If we hold \uc2 Trump\uc2  to the same standard as a career politician, we're always going to be disappointed because he hasn't spent a lifetime with his finger in the wind like Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 ," said Michael Caputo, a former \uc2 Trump\uc2  staffer.\par \par \uc2 But unlike Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  has released reams of policy papers on a wide range of topics. Her campaign website includes detailed overviews of her positions on 32 issues; Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's site covers seven issues.\par \par \uc2 Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  recently posted a link on \uc2 Twitter\uc2  to the issues section of her campaign site, adding a jab at Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 . "I sweat the specifics because they matter," she wrote.\par \par \uc2 Trump\uc2 's tax policy is one of his most detailed, offering to push millions of taxpayers off the income-tax rolls and lower rates for businesses and individuals. It also promises significant tax cuts for all income groups while claiming not to widen budget deficits.\par \par \uc2 An analysis by the conservative-leaning \uc2 Tax Foundation\uc2  found that the plan would increase economic growth but reduce federal revenue by $10 trillion over a decade, even after assuming additional revenue spurred by that economic expansion.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  in May said high-income taxpayers would pay more. That seemed to break with Republican orthodoxy, but he later clarified that they could pay more compared with the tax-cut starting point in his plan, once that plan was negotiated in Congress.\par \par \uc2 Still, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  has suggested he might alter the plan. So far, he hasn't announced any changes.\par \par \uc2 "I always believe in flexibility and remaining flexible," he said in a May interview.\par \par \uc2 ---\par \par \uc2 Richard Rubin contributed to this article.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=wjco20160630000060"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document J000000020160827ec6u00004\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw272\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4080\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  and her top aides grew frustrated with the private email system she set up as secretary of state, concerned that at times it slowed communications and interfered with her diplomatic work, according to a deposition released Wednesday.\par \par \uc2 One of Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's closest aides, Huma Abedin, gave the deposition this week as part of a lawsuit. In it, she talked about an incident in 2010 in which Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  apparently missed a call with a French government official because an email she had sent authorizing the call was slow in arriving.\par \par \uc2 In the deposition, released Wednesday by the plaintiff, the conservative watchdog group \uc2 Judicial Watch\uc2 , Ms. Abedin described being "frustrated ... at the fact that I wasn't getting her messages."\par \par \uc2 Ms. Abedin, commenting on a publicly released email exchange she had with her boss in November 2010 about the missed call, said of Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  that "she seems frustrated, because she's not able to do her job."\par \par \uc2 As secretary of state, Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  relied exclusively on a personal email account linked to a private server for official business. She has said she did so because she wanted the convenience of using a single device to handle all of her government and personal correspondence.\par \par \uc2 The State Department Inspector General released a report last month that said Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's email practices violated the department's policies. The report also faulted Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  for not seeking approval to set up a private system.\par \par \uc2 An aide to Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  for 20 years, Ms. Abedin regularly emailed Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  and had her own account on the same private server.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=wjco20160630000059"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document J000000020160827ec6u00003\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw272\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4080\pichgoal600

\par\par \b \uc2 Election\uc2  2016: Democrats Line Up On Key Battleground\b0\par\par\uc2 By Colleen McCain Nelson And Valerie Bauerlein   \par \uc2 655 \uc2 words\par \uc2 30 June 2016\par \uc2 The Wall Street Journal\par \uc2 J\par A4\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 RALEIGH, N.C. -- President \uc2 Barack Obama\uc2  will make his campaign-trail debut with \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  on Tuesday in North Carolina, launching what is expected to be an aggressive effort by Democrats to regain this swing state in November.\par \par \uc2 After flipping between the two parties in the last two presidential elections, North Carolina is emerging as a key battleground and a highly trafficked destination for both parties' presumptive nominees. Republican \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  campaigned in the state earlier this month. Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  was in Raleigh last week, and her campaign announced Wednesday that the president and his former secretary of state would make their inaugural joint appearance in Charlotte next week.\par \par \uc2 Democrats face a challenge in the state, where the GOP has been on an impressive run in recent years. Republicans gained control of the state legislature in 2010, the governor's mansion in 2012 and have had both \uc2 U.S. Senate\uc2  seats since 2014.\par \par \uc2 But Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's controversial profile, as well as a backlash to a new bathroom law, have raised Democrats' hopes. The new law, approved by the GOP-led legislature, requires transgender people to use the bathroom of the sex corresponding to their birth certificate. Republicans said the law was meant to protect public safety, while some businesses, civil-rights groups and the Obama administration called it discriminatory. Legislators are scrambling to roll back parts of the law.\par \par \uc2 North Carolina is among eight battleground states where the \uc2 Clinton\uc2  campaign already is buying ads. The presumptive Democratic nominee has staff on the ground, as well.\par \par \uc2 North Carolina, which has a significant African-American population, is a natural place for Mr. Obama and Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  to try to energize the minority voters Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  will need in November, said David Winston, a longtime GOP pollster. If the Democrats succeed, "that obviously puts the state in play," he said.\par \par \uc2 "Based on the last \uc2 election\uc2 , there probably has to be a slight edge to a Republican candidate, but the key word there is slight," he said.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  said Wednesday that he "will do great in North Carolina."\par \par \uc2 "People of North Carolina want strength, protection and jobs, and President Obama and \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  have let them down for many years," he said in a statement. "I will bring jobs back to North Carolina and our country, like never seen before."\par \par \uc2 Polling in the race is sparse but suggests that the race is tight, with one candidate or the other holding a lead within each poll's margin of error. Republican \uc2 Mitt Romney\uc2  carried North Carolina in 2012 by 2 percentage points, the closest margin of any state after Florida.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Obama carried the state in 2008 by less than half a percentage point.\par \par \uc2 North Carolina is "purely a swing state," said Carter Wrenn, a Republican strategist who led statewide campaigns for Ronald Reagan and Jesse Helms.\par \par \uc2 Democrats and Republicans can count on roughly 35% each of the statewide vote, he said. Then, "it's all about who can get 51% of the independent voters," Mr. Wrenn said.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's strength is with rural conservatives and independents, whose political strength is waning as the cities and suburbs grow, he said.\par \par \uc2 Around Charlotte, Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  is expected to make a play for independent voters in a fast-growing metropolis surrounded by wealthy suburbs that are filled with newcomers. Mr. Obama also could help energize African-American voters.\par \par \uc2 "I'm with her, I am fired up, and I cannot wait to get out there to campaign for Hillary," the president said in a video announcing his endorsement of the presumptive Democratic nominee.\par \par \uc2 Lindsay Walters, a spokeswoman for the Republican National Committee, said that after losing statewide in the last midterm and presidential elections, it would be difficult for Democrats to break that trend in North Carolina.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=wjco20160630000056"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document J000000020160827ec6u00002\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw272\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4080\pichgoal600

\par\par \b \uc2 Election\uc2  2016: Attorney General, Bill \uc2 Clinton\uc2  Meet\b0\par\par\uc2 By Devlin Barrett   \par \uc2 472 \uc2 words\par \uc2 30 June 2016\par \uc2 The Wall Street Journal\par \uc2 J\par A4\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 Attorney General Loretta Lynch met privately with former President Bill \uc2 Clinton\uc2  in Arizona on Tuesday, but Ms. Lynch told reporters that the two didn't discuss the investigation into his wife's email use as secretary of state.\par \par \uc2 Ms. Lynch said at a press conference that the \uc2 Clinton\uc2  meeting was unplanned. Mr. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  was apparently waiting to fly out of the Phoenix airport when Ms. Lynch's plane coincidentally landed there. The former president then walked over to the attorney general's plane to speak to Ms. Lynch and her husband.\par \par \uc2 "Our conversation was a great deal about his grandchildren. It was primarily social and about our travels," Ms. Lynch told reporters in Phoenix on Tuesday.\par \par \uc2 "We talked about former Attorney General Janet Reno, for example, whom we both know, but there was no discussion of any matter pending for the department or any matter pending for any other body. There was no discussion of Benghazi, no discussion of the State Department emails, by way of example," she said.\par \par \uc2 The two did discuss the recent vote in the U.K. to leave the \uc2 European Union\uc2 , but the Justice Department isn't involved in that issue, she said.\par \par \uc2 An aide to Bill \uc2 Clinton\uc2  said no topics were discussed beyond what was described by Ms. Lynch. A spokesman for \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's presidential campaign didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.\par \par \uc2 But others suggested the meeting could send the wrong message. "It's probably ill-advised because it does create the appearance of impropriety," said Ken Sukhia, a former U.S. Attorney for the Northern District of Florida who is now running for Congress as a Republican. "You don't necessarily have to talk about the subject to garner some good will [from prosecutors] by having that kind of conversation."\par \par \uc2 The impromptu meeting comes at a sensitive time in the criminal probe of Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's use of a private email server to do government business while she was secretary of state.\par \par \uc2 Agents with the \uc2 Federal Bureau of Investigation\uc2  have interviewed many of Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's senior aides from her tenure as secretary of state, and they plan to interview the former secretary herself in coming weeks, according to officials. As attorney general, Ms. Lynch will have the final say on whether any charges are brought against Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  has said it was a mistake to use personal email but has denied wrongdoing. She has repeatedly dismissed any suggestion she could be charged with a crime.\par \par \uc2 Officials familiar with the investigation have said it is unlikely criminal charges would result from that investigation, but some Republican lawmakers suggested long before Tuesday's meeting that Ms. Lynch couldn't weigh the issue impartially.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=wjco20160630000057"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document J000000020160827ec6u00001\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw272\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4080\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  offered some promising thoughts on taxes, regulation and energy in a speech on Tuesday -- too bad they were made in passing, near the end, almost as an afterthought. Most of what his campaign billed as his signature economic message was the most detailed assault on trade by a presidential candidate since -- well, we can't remember. Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  wants to make Republicans into the Tariff Party.\par \par \uc2 "Our original Constitution did not even have an income tax. Instead, it had tariffs -- emphasizing taxation of foreign, not domestic, production. Yet today, 240 years after the Revolution, we have turned things completely upside-down," Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  said in remarks outside Pittsburgh.\par \par \uc2 He added that if China, Mexico, Canada and others don't bend to his demands and rewrite our trade agreements, he will "use every lawful presidential power to remedy trade disputes, including the application of tariffs consistent with Section 201 and 301 of the Trade Act of 1974 and Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962." So much for the idea that Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  would modify his antitrade views for the general \uc2 election\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Instead he's escalating, as he bids for Bernie Sanders voters and electoral votes in the industrial Midwest. Perhaps he figures swing states with large Hispanic populations like Florida and Colorado are already lost. So he's doubling down on a strategy to win white working-class voters who have been told for years by Democrats that trade is to blame for their declining economic fortunes. We'll find out soon enough if this works politically, but as economics it's nonsense.\par \par \uc2 ---\par \par \uc2 Start with his idea that tariffs are good for economic growth. A tariff is a tax levied at the national border. A tariff raises the cost of imports, which reduces the standard of living of consumers who buy finished goods or businesses that buy inputs for their products.\par \par \uc2 If a domestic producer can replace the import at the same cost, the harm is minimal. But if that were true, there usually would be no demand for the import. Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  understands this in his own business, which is why he farms out production of his ties, scarves and other branded \uc2 Trump\uc2  products to China.\par \par \uc2 The same logic applies to the \uc2 North American Free Trade Agreement\uc2 , which Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  calls "the worst trade deal in history." He cites as an authority the \uc2 Economic Policy Institute\uc2 , the \uc2 AFL-CIO\uc2 's think tank, but that's like asking Sid Blumenthal if \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  is trustworthy. Most economists understand that free trade with Mexico and Canada has been a historic success.\par \par \uc2 Nafta\uc2  took effect on Jan. 1, 1994, and the American economy boomed for the rest of that decade. The U.S. jobless rate fell to 3.8% in April 2000. \uc2 Nafta\uc2  helped Mexico recover faster from one of its familiar peso crises in late 1994, and today our southern neighbor is providing more jobs at home for workers who once would have illegally crossed the U.S. border.\par \par \uc2 Nafta\uc2  has also helped U.S. industry stay globally competitive. Many companies have moved plants to Mexico, but they often supply parts for U.S. finished goods. An April 2015 \uc2 Congressional Research Service\uc2  study credits Nafta "with helping U.S. manufacturing industries, especially the U.S. auto industry, become more globally competitive through the development of supply chains." By moving some low-wage jobs to Mexico, car makers have been able to maintain U.S. production.\par \par \uc2 If Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  imposed a tariff on Mexico now, he'd in effect be taxing American exports. The same CRS study cites evidence that "40% of the content of U.S. imports from Mexico and 25% of the content of U.S. imports from Canada are of U.S. origin."\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  also cites Ronald Reagan's tariffs on motorcycles and semiconductors. But the Gipper was a committed free trader who applied narrow tariffs only rarely and reluctantly. His tariff on memory chips was a particular fiasco that damaged American computer makers. The U.S. semiconductor industry was saved by innovation that moved to higher-value microprocessors.\par \par \uc2 Most preposterous is Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's claim that trade protection is a declaration of "independence from elites" in Washington. Trade favoritism is the epitome of crony capitalism that benefits those with the best political connections. Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's tariffs would be the crony equivalent of President Obama's subsidies for Al Gore's green-energy investments. The only difference is who benefits.\par \par \uc2 ---\par \par \uc2 Americans are frustrated by slow economic and wage growth, but the first obligation of political leaders is not to deceive them with false remedies. Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's tariff remedy would face furious foreign opposition, and it would probably end in tears if he imposed it.\par \par \uc2 As for the \uc2 election\uc2  campaign, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's protectionism contradicts his promise of economic revival. He'll have a better chance of winning the economic debate if he focuses on the taxes, regulations and monetary policy that are the real cause of our economic malaise.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=wjco20160630000098"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document J000000020160826ec6u0003s\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw272\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4080\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 Wonder Land\par \b \uc2 Government Hits the Wall\b0\par\par\uc2 By Daniel Henninger   \par \uc2 867 \uc2 words\par \uc2 30 June 2016\par \uc2 The Wall Street Journal\par \uc2 J\par A9\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 The vote by the people of the United Kingdom to separate from the \uc2 European Union\uc2  was actually Brexit the Sequel. The first Brexit vote took place 35 years ago in the United States, with the \uc2 election\uc2  of Ronald Reagan, who carried 44 states.\par \par \uc2 Reagan, in his first inaugural address in 1981, could not have been more explicit about what his \uc2 election\uc2  stood for: "In this present crisis, government is not the solution to our problem; government is the problem."\par \par \uc2 Brexit is shorthand for "government is the problem."\par \par \uc2 Liberal intellectuals have mocked Reagan for reducing his theory of government to a bumper sticker. But he elaborated on the idea with words that would have fit in the Founders' debates:\par \par \uc2 "We have been tempted to believe that society has become too complex to be managed by self-rule, that government by an elite group is superior to government for, by, and of the people. But if no one among us is capable of governing himself, then who among us has the capacity to govern someone else?"\par \par \uc2 The political values of the American and European left -- heard today in every sentence spoken by \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  and Bernie Sanders or Elizabeth Warren -- reside in an argument that is essentially this:\par \par \uc2 A good and just society comes through an economic and social compact between citizens and their government. If citizens will transmit sufficient tax revenue to the government, it will hire experts in public administration (to Reagan an "elite group") who will deliver socially desirable benefits to everyone, and will do so with equity. It is an appealing promise.\par \par \uc2 People who believe this, and some still do sincerely, regarded Reagan's inaugural formulation as the words of an antigovernment "ideologue." Still, ideology matters, and they have their own founding ideologue, Woodrow Wilson.\par \par \uc2 In his 1889 book called "The State," the future progressive Democratic president of the U.S. wrote: "Government does now whatever experience permits or the times demand." Across the 20th century, that broad claim summarized the justification for building the administrative state, here and in Europe.\par \par \uc2 That sound you heard in the United Kingdom last week was the administrative state finally hitting the wall.\par \par \uc2 It was the British people saying that the compact has been broken, not by them but by the administrative and political elites who dropped their side of the bargain.\par \par \uc2 The only way the bargain can be sustained is if the administrative state produces, or at least allows, sustained national growth. It now slows economic growth, which like a slow poison has weakened feelings of national well-being. Anti-immigrant resentment is a subset of this failure.\par \par \uc2 The creators of the \uc2 European Union\uc2  signed the enabling Maastricht Treaty in 1992 because they recognized that the economic underpinnings of the social compact were disintegrating. Everyone knew the purpose of this big step was summarized in a single, typically dry formulation: Each member would maintain "sound fiscal policies, with debt limited to 60% of GDP and annual deficits no greater than 3% of GDP."\par \par \uc2 It didn't work. Nearly all the members cheated on the benchmarks, economic growth weakened, and youth unemployment became chronic, driving France's young men and women to London for jobs.\par \par \uc2 The "administrative state" hasn't been a phrase known to drive people into the street. Until now. What we are witnessing is a global government fail -- across Europe, the Middle East, in Beijing, Delhi, Tokyo and Washington, D.C.\par \par \uc2 If votes were held today in Italy, Spain, France or Norway, many would vote to abandon the long postwar consensus on letting the bureaucracies decide how to simultaneously produce economic strength and social justice.\par \par \uc2 No better symptom exists of the compact breaking apart than the \uc2 European Central Bank\uc2 , the \uc2 U.S. Federal Reserve\uc2  and the \uc2 Bank of Japan\uc2 . They epitomize the exhaustion of elite administrative intelligence. For seven years, they failed at restoring even average economic strength, disappearing now into a black hole called negative interest rates.\par \par \uc2 The Obama presidency has been an American version of the \uc2 European Commission\uc2  from which the Brits fled. Except that U.S. courts still review, rather than rubber-stamp, the Obama Commission's executive orders ranging across labor, the environment, the internet, financial institutions and universities.\par \par \uc2 Had U.S. courts not pushed back against many of the Obama government's rules and "guidance" directives, the famous "pen-and-phone" authority, this presidency would have come close to putting the states in the same relation to Washington as that between the once-sovereign states of Europe and Brussels.\par \par \uc2 If Woodrow Wilson was the American godfather of this transformation, \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  is its handmaiden. She knows the drill. With four more years of an Obama-\uc2 Clinton\uc2  presidency and possibly Democratic control of Congress, the 100-year-old progressive goal of making the 50 American states obey one set of administrative specialists who reside in a single city will be close to complete.\par \par \uc2 So yes, whether to vote in November for \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  or \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  is an interesting proposition.

\par\par \uc2 Foreign Desk; SECTA\par \b \uc2 Canada Summit Meeting Focuses on Climate, Both Political and Global\b0\par\par\uc2 By MARK LANDLER; Ian Austen contributed reporting. \par \uc2 1,248 \uc2 words\par \uc2 30 June 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 11\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 OTTAWA -- For President Obama, foreign trips these days have increasingly become an exercise in explaining the inflamed politics of his country to nervous foreigners.\par \par \uc2 So it was here on Wednesday, when Mr. Obama joined the leaders of Canada and Mexico at a summit meeting that began as a show of North American solidarity and ended up as an attempt to repudiate the nativist and isolationist currents that are agitating politics in the United States, as well as in Europe.\par \par \uc2 With the gothic spires of Canada's Parliament as a backdrop, Mr. Obama, Prime Minister \uc2 Justin Trudeau\uc2  of Canada and President Enrique Pe\u241\'00\'F1a Nieto of Mexico announced a landmark agreement on climate change and extolled the benefits of a Pacific Rim trade agreement. But it was the charged words in the American \uc2 election\uc2  and Britain's departure from the \uc2 European Union\uc2  that seized most of the attention.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Obama deplored the anti-immigrant remarks of \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , the presumptive Republican nominee, particularly his statements about Mexican immigrants. Though he never mentioned Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  by name, Mr. Obama said the next American president would have a strong interest in having a solid relationship with ''our good neighbor to the south.''\par \par \uc2 Speaking at a news conference with the Canadian and Mexican leaders after their meeting, the president said that anti-immigrant appeals had a long history in the United States, but that they had never permanently curtailed the flow of people into the country.\par \par \uc2 ''We should take some of this rhetoric seriously and answer it boldly and clearly,'' Mr. Obama said, answering a question from a Mexican journalist, ''but you shouldn't think it is representative of how the American people think.''\par \par \uc2 Mr. Obama said he rejected the argument that the harsh tone in the American presidential campaign, or in Britain's recent referendum on leaving the \uc2 European Union\uc2 , was populist. He ridiculed the notion that a candidate who worked to preserve the interests of wealthy people could be a populist.\par \par \uc2 ''They don't suddenly become populist because they say something controversial in order to win votes,'' Mr. Obama said. ''That's not the measure of populism; that's nativism or xenophobia or worse. Or it's just cynicism.''\par \par \uc2 Mr. Pe\u241\'00\'F1a Nieto, for his part, put Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  in a line of populist demagogues, including Hitler and Mussolini, though he, like Mr. Obama, did not use the candidate's name. ''Those political actors, by using populism and demagoguery, they choose the easiest way to solve the challenges of today's world,'' he said.\par \par \uc2 Their comments lent urgency to the North American leaders' summit meeting, a diplomatic ritual that usually goes unnoticed by the public. This meeting, in fact, slipped from being an annual gathering during the administration of George W. Bush to once-every-few-years during Mr. Obama's presidency.\par \par \uc2 For Mr. Trudeau, who has inherited Mr. Obama's mantle as a change agent, the meeting was a sort of debut on the global stage. He presented the deal under which Canada, the United States and Mexico pledged to generate half their power through clean energy sources by 2025. To achieve that goal, they will seek to harmonize energy regulations, increase energy efficiency and reduce emissions of methane, a greenhouse gas.\par \par \uc2 Under Mr. Trudeau's conservative predecessor, \uc2 Stephen Harper\uc2 , Canada pulled out of its commitments to the first global climate pact, the Kyoto Protocol, and clashed with the United States over Mr. Obama's opposition to the Keystone XL oil pipeline. But Mr. Trudeau has recommitted Canada to legislative efforts to combat climate change, much as Mr. Obama did when he succeeded Mr. Bush in 2009.\par \par \uc2 For Mr. Obama, the visit was a chance to galvanize three major economies behind the advances made in the Paris climate-change accord, at a time when Britain's vote to leave the \uc2 European Union\uc2  has clouded the prospects for multilateral cooperation and the durability of international agreements.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Obama said he worried that Britain's exit from the \uc2 European Union\uc2  would freeze investment in the country and in Europe. The leaders also discussed the impact of Britain's vote on trade agreements. Mexico and Canada are signatories to the Trans-Pacific Partnership, the mammoth Asia-Pacific deal that has stalled in the United States, with \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , the presumptive Democratic nominee, and Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  both coming out against it.\par \par \uc2 Appearing with Mr. Pe\u241\'00\'F1a Nieto on Tuesday, a day before Mr. Obama's arrival, Mr. Trudeau said, ''We've seen around the world many examples of protectionism, of stepping away from trade agreements and engagements like we're showcasing today.''\par \par \uc2 In a speech to the \uc2 Canadian Parliament\uc2  later in the day, Mr. Obama acknowledged that globalization had unleashed deeply disruptive forces.\par \par \uc2 ''While the circumstances of Brexit may be unique to the United Kingdom,'' he said, ''the frustrations that people feel are not.'' But an interconnected world, he argued, was irreversible. The remedy was to pursue policies like the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which would level the playing field.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Obama's relations with Mr. Harper were tense, and the president had not visited Canada since 2010. With Mr. Trudeau's \uc2 election\uc2 , however, the chill has given way to an affectionate big-brother relationship. In March, Mr. Obama celebrated Mr. Trudeau during a state visit to Washington that felt at times like a passing of the torch.\par \par \uc2 ''He campaigned on a message of hope and of change; his positive and optimistic vision is inspiring young people,'' Mr. Obama said. ''On the world stage, his country is leading on climate change and cares deeply about development, so from my perspective, what's not to like?''\par \par \uc2 This summit meeting is being marketed as a meeting of ''three amigos.'' But Mr. Obama is spending less time in Ottawa than Mr. Trudeau did in Washington. After his speech to the Parliament, at which he received a rapturous reception, Mr. Obama flew home, not spending a single night in the Canadian capital.\par \par \uc2 Like most countries with a larger and more powerful neighbor, Canada has a general wariness toward the United States and its political leaders. As a result, Canadian prime ministers have generally been careful to be seen as friendly but not too cozy with American presidents.\par \par \uc2 However, there appears to be little danger of that for Mr. Trudeau when it comes to Mr. Obama. Throughout Mr. Obama's presidency, he has not only been Canadians' favorite American politician, he has also enjoyed higher ratings than Canadian politicians. One poll released on Wednesday found him more popular even than the charismatic Mr. Trudeau.\par \par \uc2 Perhaps more surprisingly, the fondness of Canadians for Mr. Obama transcends party lines.\par \par \uc2 Christine Campbell and her husband, Rob, woke up at 5 a.m. on Wednesday to travel from Perth, Ontario, into Ottawa to wait along Mr. Obama's motorcade route. While she voted for Mr. Harper's Conservatives during Canada's \uc2 election\uc2  last October, she said that she had always admired Mr. Obama and that she hoped Mr. Trudeau took some tips from the American president.\par \par \uc2 ''Trudeau is just starting out, he's learning the ropes,'' Ms. Campbell said as she stood at an intersection where the motorcade would soon turn. ''Possibly Mr. Obama will be a good mentor for him.''\par \par \uc2 From left, President Enrique Pe\u241\'00\'F1a Nieto of Mexico, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada and President Obama on Wednesday.

\par\par \uc2 National Desk; SECTA\par \b \uc2 Top \uc2 Clinton\uc2  Aide Describes Email Server Frustrations\b0\par\par\uc2 By STEVEN LEE MYERS and ERIC LICHTBLAU \par \uc2 1,019 \uc2 words\par \uc2 30 June 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 18\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Huma Abedin, \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's longtime aide and confidante, acknowledged that Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's use of a private email server while secretary of state created frustration at times because of computer glitches but said she did not raise concerns about the unusual arrangement, according to a transcript of a deposition made public on Wednesday.\par \par \uc2 Ms. Abedin, who served as Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's deputy chief of staff at the State Department and is now the vice chairwoman of her presidential campaign, said her boss's use of the private server was never intended to sidestep federal record-keeping laws. Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , she said, wanted to protect her personal information ''just like anybody who has personal email would want to keep their personal email private.''\par \par \uc2 The exchange focused on a 2010 email first disclosed by the State Department's inspector general in a scathing report last month, in which Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  raised concerns about accepting a new \uc2 BlackBerry\uc2  because she did not want ''any risk of the personal being accessible.'' Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  has previously said that using a single, private email address on a private server was simply a matter of convenience.\par \par \uc2 Ms. Abedin is the seventh of eight aides and department officials who have now given sworn testimony in a legal proceeding brought by \uc2 Judicial Watch\uc2 , a conservative government watchdog organization. The organization's case began with an inquiry into Ms. Abedin's special employment status at the end of Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's tenure at the State Department. The group's initial request for documents under the Freedom of Information Act turned up little, but the matter was reopened last year after Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's exclusive use of a private email for official State Department business became known.\par \par \uc2 The depositions have drawn attention to Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's use of the server at a time the F.B.I. is completing its investigation into the emails and Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  has tried to keep the focus on her \uc2 election\uc2  campaign against \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Patrick F. Kennedy, a career foreign service officer who is an under secretary of state for management and operations, testified in the same proceedings on Wednesday. His testimony is expected to be released on Thursday.\par \par \uc2 Ms. Abedin's testimony, which lasted five hours, provided few new details about Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's use of the private server. She decided to use it when she began the move from the Senate to the State Department after President Obama nominated her to be secretary of state, a position she held from January 2009 to February 2013.\par \par \uc2 Ms. Abedin herself had an address on the private server, which aides to \uc2 Bill \uc2 Clinton\uc2  maintained at the couple's home in suburban New York, as well as an official address with the State Department's system at state.gov.\par \par \uc2 While she testified that she did most of her email work on the official account, she said that she and Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  used the private server for some government business, as well, especially while traveling abroad.\par \par \uc2 Ms. Abedin said repeatedly that she gave no thought during her time at the State Department as to how the use of the private email server might affect requests for records under the Freedom of Information Act. She said she did not remember the preservation of records ever being discussed with Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  or with other State Department officials, even after public requests came in.\par \par \uc2 She said that because most of those emails were State Department-related issues forwarded from her government account, she assumed there was already a record of the exchange in the government account.\par \par \uc2 ''Honestly, I wish I thought about it at the time,'' she said. ''As I said, I wasn't perfect. I tried to do all of my work on state.gov. And I do believe I did the majority of my work on state.gov.''\par \par \uc2 Quizzed about the concerns Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  expressed in 2010 about her personal emails being made public, Ms. Abedin explained that at the time she and others in the department were trying to figure out why Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  had not received an email about a telephone call with Bernard Kouchner, who was then the foreign minister of France.\par \par \uc2 Ms. Abedin suggested to Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  that she should have a separate \uc2 BlackBerry\uc2  for work or post her personal address so that others in the department beyond her inner circle would know how to reach her in the future. In the end, both alternatives were rejected.\par \par \uc2 That exchange with Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , Ms. Abedin said, was an occasion when the email arrangement disrupted official business, one of several glitches described in the depositions or the inspector general's report.\par \par \uc2 ''Just reading the exchange, she seems frustrated because she's not able to do her job,'' Ms. Abedin said, referring to Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 . ''I seem frustrated back because I'm not.''\par \par \uc2 Ms. Abedin said repeatedly that she could not recall specific details about Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's email practices and said she was unaware of most of the technical matters involved. She also acknowledged that she refused to speak with the inspector general for its investigation -- ''on the advice of my attorneys.''\par \par \uc2 Ms. Abedin, like Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  and others, said she assumed that the use of a private email was allowed, even though the inspector general's report concluded that no permission was ever sought and it would have been turned down if it had.\par \par \uc2 Asked why neither she nor other aides to Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  mentioned the private server to State Department officials in charge of preserving documents, she described it as an oversight. ''It is not anything that occurred to us,'' she said. ''We all wish we could go back and that not be the case.''\par \par \uc2 Follow The \uc2 New York Times\uc2 's politics and Washington coverage on \uc2 Facebook\uc2  and \uc2 Twitter\uc2 , and sign up for the First Draft politics newsletter.\par \par \uc2 Huma Abedin, deputy chief of staff for Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  at the State Department, now works for her presidential campaign.

\par\par \uc2 National Desk; SECTA\par \b \uc2 Conservative to Fund Republicans Who Back Climate Change Action\b0\par\par\uc2 By CORAL DAVENPORT \par \uc2 1,304 \uc2 words\par \uc2 30 June 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 19\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 WASHINGTON -- A self-described conservative North Carolina businessman has promised to spend at least $5 million through his political action committee to back five Republican congressional candidates who have supported taking action to curb climate change.\par \par \uc2 Even as his party's presumptive presidential nominee denies the existence of global warming, the businessman, Jay Faison, and his ClearPath Action Fund will spend at least $2 million on digital media campaigns to defend Senate incumbents running in two of the tightest races in the country, Rob Portman in Ohio and Kelly Ayotte in New Hampshire, a recognition of the senators' support for clean energy, Mr. Faison said Wednesday. The advertisements are expected to start running this week.\par \par \uc2 ClearPath is also spending several hundred thousand dollars on digital advertising campaigns to support Representatives Carlos Curbelo of Florida and Tom Reed and Elise Stefanik of New York, all Republicans running for re-\uc2 election\uc2  in similarly tight races.\par \par \uc2 ''What we're trying to do is prove to the party, through these races, that clean energy wins races, to build a political safe space for the Republican Party to talk about this,'' Mr. Faison said in an interview. ''It is difficult for a politician to consistently act in an area with no reward. We have their back.'' He added, ''We're also making that case to the \uc2 Trump\uc2  campaign.''\par \par \uc2 The spending comes as Republican leaders have questioned or denied the established science of human-caused climate change and attacked President Obama's climate change policies. \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , the presumptive nominee, has mocked climate science and vowed to cancel the Paris Agreement, the 2015 global accord committing nearly every country on earth to taking action to fight climate change.\par \par \uc2 Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader, calls Mr. Obama's climate policies a ''war on coal.'' But some Republican members of Congress who hope to carve out careers that could outlast Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's have begun to quietly consider how to address climate change, which they believe resonates with a growing segment of voters, particularly young people.\par \par \uc2 Political strategists are paying attention to polls that show Americans expressing record- or near-record-high belief that global warming is happening. A March Gallup poll found that 64 percent of American adults worry ''a great deal'' or ''a fair amount'' about global warming, the highest number since 2008, and it found that a record 65 percent of Americans attribute global warming to human activity.\par \par \uc2 However, most polls asking voters to rank the importance of issues find that environmental concerns trail far behind concerns about jobs and the economy.\par \par \uc2 Still, in many campaigns, Democrats are attacking Republicans as climate deniers.\par \par \uc2 Some moderate Republicans hope to use their views on climate change to draw a contrast with Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 ''All of them need to demonstrate a level of independence from the national party in order to survive,'' said Nathan Gonzales, editor of the nonpartisan Rothenberg & Gonzales Political Report, speaking of the five lawmakers backed by Mr. Faison's group. ''They'll need to declare independence from \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2 .''\par \par \uc2 In 2015, Ms. Ayotte broke with her party to vote against a measure written by Mr. McConnell that would have blocked Mr. Obama's climate change rules. She also voted for a program to establish grants to schools for climate change education, against a proposal to block the Obama administration from signing on to the Paris climate change accord, and in favor of a federal fund to respond to the threat of climate change.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Portman voted with his party on most of those measures, but also voted in favor of the fund to respond to climate threats. He has worked for years with Senator Jeanne Shaheen, Democrat of New Hampshire, on a bill to improve energy efficiency in buildings. He is a former board member of \uc2 the Nature Conservancy\uc2  and is a co-author of legislation to support cleanup of the Great Lakes.\par \par \uc2 The three House members backed by Mr. Faison's group are among just 13 Republicans who have signed on to a resolution, offered by Representative Chris Gibson, Republican of New York. ''The resolution was a vehicle to find out which Republicans were willing to step up and take some action,'' said Steve Valk, a spokesman for Citizen's Climate Lobby.\par \par \uc2 But while those five Republicans' environmental records stand out from many in their party, they have voted more times against environmental regulations than in favor. The \uc2 League of Conservation Voters\uc2 , which tracks lawmakers' environmental records on a scale of 1 to 100, have given lifetime scores to Ms. Ayotte of 35 percent, Mr. Portman of 20 percent, Mr. Curbelo of 23 percent, Mr. Reed of 6 percent and Ms. Stefanik of 9 percent. ''To give House Republicans like Elise Stefanik, Tom Reed or Carlos Curbelo credit for acknowledging that climate change is real is a very low bar,'' said Meredith Kelly, a spokeswoman for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee.\par \par \uc2 In Miami, Mr. Curbelo's opponent, Annette Tadeo, a Democrat, has slammed his climate positions as hypocritical. ''Big oil and gas lobbyists have been filling his campaign coffers with thousands of dollars in cash, in exchange for his advocacy for offshore drilling,'' she said in a statement.\par \par \uc2 In Ohio, Mr. Portman is fighting to keep his seat against a former governor, Ted Strickland, who notes his support of Mr. Obama's climate plan and slams Mr. Portman for voting against it.\par \par \uc2 In upstate New York, a local newspaper, The Post-Star, noted that Ms. Stefanik's support for the climate change resolution was paired with votes against Mr. Obama's climate change plan. ''We were especially interested in how she could acknowledge climate change in one stand, yet vote to delay implementation of the Clean Power Plan (new standards for coal-burning power plants), especially while representing a region that was devastated by acid rain from those plants in the Midwest,'' the paper's editorial board wrote.\par \par \uc2 Some political observers have drawn comparisons between Mr. Faison and Tom Steyer, the billionaire environmentalist and Democratic donor whose political action committee, NextGen Climate Action, has spent heavily to push candidates who champion climate change issues. Mr. Steyer emerged as the single biggest political donor of the 2014 cycle, spending $74 million to influence voters, far more than the $5 million pledged by Mr. Faison's group. Mr. Steyer, whose group has already laid out plans to spend at least $25 million in 2016, disavowed the comparison to Mr. Faison.\par \par \uc2 ''From what we can tell by the people he is supporting, he is grading Republicans on the curve,'' Mr. Steyer said in an interview. ''We have fairly objective standards for grading people, and none of the them come close to meeting our standards.'' Mr. Steyer said his group planned to support the Democratic Senate candidates in Ohio and New Hampshire.\par \par \uc2 And while the ads run by Mr. Faison's group note the candidates' support of clean energy, showing lush green fields and sparkling blue skies, they never explicitly mention the term climate change. Mr. Faison acknowledges that while he supports Republicans who have supported climate change policy, it is still too politically divisive to actually use the phrase.\par \par \uc2 ''Climate change is a divisive term on the Hill and it's a divisive term among the electorate,'' said Mr. Faison. ''But 'clean energy' tells a voter you care about the environment, and deflects attacks about climate change.''\par \par \uc2 Follow The \uc2 New York Times\uc2 's politics and Washington coverage on \uc2 Facebook\uc2  and \uc2 Twitter\uc2 , and sign up for the First Draft politics newsletter.\par \par \uc2 Jay Faison, a conservative North Carolina businessman, is backing two incumbents in the Senate and three in the House.

\par\par \uc2 THE 2016 RACE\par \uc2 National Desk; SECTA\par \b \uc2 How \uc2 Trump\uc2  Could Redraw Voters' Allegiances\b0\par\par\uc2 By NATE COHN \par \uc2 884 \uc2 words\par \uc2 30 June 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 3\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 For decades, Republicans argued for lower taxes, fewer regulations and a smaller welfare state. Democrats took up the opposite view, and voters split along familiar lines.\par \par \uc2 Whatever you think of \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2 , it is clear that this \uc2 election\uc2  has the potential to reshape the allegiances of many white working-class voters who have traditionally sided with the Democrats, and many well-educated voters who have sided with the Republicans.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  on Tuesday laid out a radically different economic message than Republicans have advanced, and it holds considerable appeal to white working-class Democrats. He supported renegotiating or withdrawing from Nafta, cracking down on Chinese currency manipulation, and using United States steel for domestic infrastructure -- which he promises to rebuild.\par \par \uc2 Along with his departures on immigration and the welfare state, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  is moving away from the labor fights and culture wars that defined 20th-century politics, and toward the new divide over globalization and multiculturalism that might define 21st-century politics.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  currently trails in most polls. But according to a 2014 study by Pew Research on political polarization, positions like those held by Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  on trade, immigration, guns and the environment have considerable support from white working-class Democrats.\par \par \uc2 Around 40 percent of white Democrats without a college degree agree that free trade has done more harm than good (exit polls showed the same thing in the Democratic primary), or think the United States should get tougher with China on economic issues. Similar numbers agree with Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  on guns and immigration. All of Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's stances are more popular than traditional Republican views on the welfare state or culture war issues like abortion or same-sex marriage.\par \par \uc2 The potential for Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  to break through among white working-class voters isn't merely theoretical. Recent public opinion surveys -- even those showing Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  trailing Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  by a wide margin -- all show him leading Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  by a wider margin among white voters without a college degree than the margin by which \uc2 Mitt Romney\uc2  led President Obama in 2012. Over all, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  leads among white voters without a college degree by a 57-to-31 margin in the last six national polls. Mr. Romney led by a 55-to-37 percent margin with those voters in a compilation of the final polls in 2012.\par \par \uc2 These gains have not been enough to give Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  an overall lead. He trails by an average of five points in the same surveys.\par \par \uc2 But the extent to which Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  is doing well among white working-class voters is important to Democrats. There are more white working-class voters than is generally believed, and Mr. Obama was stronger among these voters than typically assumed.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's speech on Tuesday was delivered in Monessen, Pa., the sort of place that typifies the overlooked Democratic resilience among white working-class voters, and that Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  needs in November. The area was once one of the most reliably Democratic parts of the country, and even today, Democrats still fare fairly well among white working-class voters. President Obama won Monessen by a 66-33 percent margin, and the town is at the tip of a region along the Monongahela River where Mr. Obama won among white working-class voters.\par \par \uc2 There are places like this -- traditionally Democratic, white working-class areas where Mr. Obama still showed important strength -- across the Northern United States. In Pennsylvania alone, there are similar regions along the Beaver River -- north of Pittsburgh -- or in the Scranton-Wilkes Barre area in northeast Pennsylvania. There's Youngstown and Warren, Ohio -- or a whole strip of towns along Lake Erie, from Toledo, Ohio, back to Erie, Pa. Many of these same areas broke heavily for Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  in the Republican primary.\par \par \uc2 We will not know until November whether Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  will attract these traditionally Democratic voters. Even if he does, he might fall far short of winning the presidency, as current polls suggest. His gains among less educated white voters have been neatly canceled by losses among well-educated voters.\par \par \uc2 This could prevent Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  from winning in states with a large white working class. A recent \uc2 Marquette University\uc2  poll showed Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  winning by seven points among white working-class voters in Wisconsin. Yet Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  was leading by a huge 22-point margin among well-educated white voters, even though four years ago they split almost evenly between parties. The same dynamic could doom Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  in Pennsylvania.\par \par \uc2 But if you want to know why Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  is still in striking distance -- why Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  is generally well beneath 50 percent, and not faring too much better among registered voters than Mr. Obama was in the fall of 2012 -- this is why: Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  has made big gains among less educated white voters. He has adopted a platform to do it.\par \par \uc2 The Upshot provides news, analysis and graphics about politics, policy and everyday life. Follow us on \uc2 Facebook\uc2  and \uc2 Twitter\uc2 .

\par\par \uc2 Politics; SECT\par \b \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  Makes Forceful Case for His Candidacy in Trade Speech\b0\par\par\uc2 By MAGGIE HABERMAN \par \uc2 267 \uc2 words\par \uc2 30 June 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 The New York Times on the Web\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 In his most expansive speech to date, \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2  laid out a case on Tuesday for tearing up trade pacts and confronting China as he stood at a recycling plant near Pittsburgh.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's speech was perhaps the most forceful case he has made for the crux of his candidacy: not just that he is a businessman with a well-established personal brand, but that the days of globalism have passed, and that a new approach is necessary.\par \par \uc2 He did not suggest change in tiny increments. Instead, he forcefully challenged the decades-old shibboleths of Republican economic orthodoxy as yoked closely to pro-business interests. Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  did not expressly describe his views as nationalist, but he did call for an era of economic ''Americanism.''\par \par \uc2 The speech was well delivered by a candidate who is still adjusting to the use of teleprompters. And it was the opening shot of a general \uc2 election\uc2  effort that is focused on winning states with large numbers of working-class white voters.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  came under attack over the speech from the United States Chamber of Commerce and from Democrats. But such criticisms are unlikely to hinder a candidate who has already positioned himself as an outsider and a flamethrower. The question for Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  will be whether he can maintain the tone and focus of the speech going forward.\par \par \uc2 Find out what you need to know about the 2016 presidential race today, and get politics news updates via \uc2 Facebook\uc2 , \uc2 Twitter\uc2  and the First Draft newsletter.\par \par \uc2 Document NYTF000020160630ec6u00050\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 Politics; SECT\par \b \uc2 Group Rallies Former National Security Figures Behind \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\b0\par\par\uc2 By MAGGIE HABERMAN \par \uc2 576 \uc2 words\par \uc2 30 June 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 The New York Times on the Web\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 The political arm of the \uc2 Center for American Progress\uc2 , a leading progressive group that is aligned with \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , is bringing together major Democratic figures in national security to focus attention on the stakes of the \uc2 election\uc2  and to highlight what they see as the damaging potential of a \uc2 Trump\uc2  presidency.\par \par \uc2 The project, called the National Security Leadership Alliance, will be funded by C.A.P. Action. It will feature a roster of major members of the foreign policy and national security community, including two retired four-star generals; Leon E. Panetta, the former C.I.A. director; \uc2 Madeleine K. Albright\uc2 , the former secretary of state; \uc2 Eric H. Holder Jr\uc2 ., the former attorney general; and \uc2 Carl Levin\uc2 , the former Michigan senator. All have endorsed Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 There will be an effort to highlight precisely what, in the military arsenal, \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2  would have access to as president. Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  has been criticized for his views on foreign policy, criticisms that have been central to the case that Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  has made against him in an effort to describe the stakes of the 2016 presidential \uc2 election\uc2 . The \uc2 Center for American Progress\uc2  is led by a top outside adviser to Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , Neera Tanden, and the new project seeks to put a spotlight on what officials are calling a progressive foreign policy vision.\par \par \uc2 ''I think what brought us together is obviously a lot of concern about some of the division and polarization that we're seeing in the world,'' Mr. Panetta said in an interview. ''We know we're living in a time of great change and uncertainty.''\par \par \uc2 But he added, ''The concern we have is we see these forces of division that are prepared to throw out the fundamental'' principles of foreign policy in the United States over many decades.\par \par \uc2 ''What we're learning from 'Brexit' is that there's a price to be paid in terms of letting out emotion dictate policy instead of responsible leadership,'' he said, referring to Britain's vote to leave the \uc2 European Union\uc2 . ''We shouldn't throw the baby out with the bath water.''\par \par \uc2 Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  and President Obama, in whose administration Mr. Panetta and Mr. Holder served, supported those who wanted Britain to remain in the \uc2 European Union\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 That vote has plunged Europe into uncertainty and has created tremors for the United States' relationship with Britain. But Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  exalted in the vote in a trip to Scotland a day after the ballots were cast last week, and he drew parallels between the nationalist forces that drove it and the presidential race in the United States.\par \par \uc2 In a statement of principles, officials with the project will say they ''reject the reckless use of American power and the folly of basing national security policy on ideology rather than on fact and critical thinking.''\par \par \uc2 While the project will be aimed at Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , Mr. Panetta studiously avoided invoking his name, saying he hoped to keep the debate focused on issues and less on personalities.\par \par \uc2 The retired Gen. John R. Allen, who will also be part of the project, echoed that sentiment. While he said he had a view of the presidential race, he was not ready to share which candidate he would support.\par \par \uc2 Find out what you need to know about the 2016 presidential race today, and get politics news updates via \uc2 Facebook\uc2 , \uc2 Twitter\uc2  and the First Draft newsletter.\par \par \uc2 Document NYTF000020160630ec6u0004w\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 Politics; SECT\par \b \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  Assails \uc2 U.S. Chamber of Commerce\uc2  Over Trade\b0\par\par\uc2 By NICK CORASANITI \par \uc2 642 \uc2 words\par \uc2 30 June 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 The New York Times on the Web\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 BANGOR, Me. -- Pressing his staunch opposition to trade deals, Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2  escalated his attacks on the \uc2 U.S. Chamber of Commerce\uc2  on Wednesday, saying it was ''totally controlled by the special interest groups.''\par \par \uc2 ''They're a special interest that wants to have the deals that they want to have,'' he told a packed arena at a rally here, to whoops and cheers. ''They want to have T.P.P., the Trans-Pacific Partnership, one of the worst deals, and it'll be the worst deal since Nafta.''\par \par \uc2 The remarks criticizing the Chamber were yet another manifestation of the divide between the Republican economic orthodoxy that embraces all trade, and the nationalistic anti-trade policies Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  laid out in a major speech Tuesday in a Pittsburgh suburb.\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 U.S. Chamber of Commerce\uc2  is often a strong ally of Republican candidates, spending more than $35 million in the 2014 midterms in support of them. But it has also been sharply critical of Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's views on trade, and has frequently posted articles critical of him on its blog, including one Tuesday night on its website titled, ''The 2013 \uc2 Trump\uc2  Was a Lot Better on Trade Than the 2016 Version.''\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  first responded to the group on \uc2 Twitter\uc2  Wednesday morning, but he escalated the attacks at his rally here, saying the Chamber was ''controlled totally by various groups of people that don't care about you whatsoever.''\par \par \uc2 A spokeswoman for the Chamber, \uc2 Blair Latoff Holmes\uc2 , defended its position on trade.\par \par \uc2 ''The U.S. Chamber represents American businesses of all sizes from across the country, who recognize that free trade agreements, like the T.P.P., are an important way to accelerate economic growth and spur job creation in the U.S.,'' she said.\par \par \uc2 ''This is not personal,'' Ms. Holmes added. ''It's not \uc2 election\uc2  politics. It's smart policy.''\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's remarks on the Chamber were the latest in a string of comments that have further divided those in the Republican ranks as he seeks to rally the party behind his campaign after a particularly contentious nominating fight.\par \par \uc2 That bruising battle was still on Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's mind Wednesday. He spent several minutes riffing on the ''pledge'' that Republican candidates all signed early in the primary contest to ultimately rally behind the party's nominee, whoever was chosen.\par \par \uc2 ''They broke their word, in my opinion,'' he said. ''They should never be allowed to run for public office again, because what they did is disgraceful.''\par \par \uc2 But while he spent the majority of his speech highlighting his trade policies and themes from his economic speech on Tuesday, he largely shied away from talking about the terrorist attacks in Istanbul later that day, although he noted how they seemed to overtake the news of his speech.\par \par \uc2 ''I gave a speech in Pittsburgh, in Pennsylvania yesterday, and it was very well received,'' Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  said. ''Then you had the tragedy in Turkey, and that was the end of that speech, which was fine.\par \par \uc2 ''That's the way it's supposed to be because that tragedy is a disgrace, that we can allow that to continue to go on whether it's Turkey or anywhere else. That's a disgrace.''\par \par \uc2 But while he pledged to fight the Islamic State and terrorism, he also professed a dovish foreign policy in an attempt to contrast himself with \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 ''They say, 'Oh, can we trust Donald with a button?' '' Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  said, adding, ''I would be the slowest with the button, but I would be the one that doesn't have to use it because they're going to respect us again.''\par \par \uc2 Find out what you need to know about the 2016 presidential race today, and get politics news updates via \uc2 Facebook\uc2 , \uc2 Twitter\uc2  and the First Draft newsletter.\par \par \uc2 Document NYTF000020160630ec6u0004z\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 OP-ED CONTRIBUTOR\par \uc2 Editorial Desk; SECTA\par \b \uc2 The G.O.P. Waits for \uc2 Trump\uc2  to Grow Up\b0\par\par\uc2 By NICOLLE WALLACE \par \uc2 1,284 \uc2 words\par \uc2 30 June 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 27\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Republicans on both sides of the \uc2 Trump\uc2  Divide are waiting for things that will never happen.\par \par \uc2 The party establishment -- including donors who should be writing big checks by now, experienced operatives who should be competing for top spots on the campaign, and Republican leaders who should be hammering out state-by-state victory plans -- is waiting for \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  to stop acting like \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 It's abundantly clear, however, that a move toward statesmanship will never materialize. The latest example: Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's salesman in chief performance in Scotland, hours after the Brexit vote. ''You know, when the pound goes down, more people are coming to Turnberry,'' he said, seeing a silver lining for the golf course he owns there.\par \par \uc2 Just a few weeks from the national convention, Republicans are stuck in these awkward standoffs that have come to embody everything that is uncomfortable and disorienting about this \uc2 election\uc2 : Our voters, in decisive numbers, picked a guy who embarrasses us.\par \par \uc2 Party leaders have watched the last eight weeks of the \uc2 Trump\uc2  candidacy the way you experience a chase scene in a dream where your legs never move fast enough to outrun the three-headed dragon on roller skates.\par \par \uc2 The cruel cycle of rooting for Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  goes something like this: The terrible press that follows his scandal of the week strengthens the hand of the advisers in Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's family and inner circle who appeal to his competitive streak. They persuade him to finally stick to a script and become a normal candidate for the presidency who delivers a speech like the one on trade that he delivered in Pennsylvania on Tuesday. We are lulled into a false sense of calm when he takes a break from his incessant intraparty trash-talking and racially divisive rhetoric. But just as one scandal ebbs and Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  appears primed to stick to a single message for an entire news cycle, he veers off course with an unscripted utterance on a morning news program.\par \par \uc2 If he were able to take a break from attacking his former opponents or other Republican leaders, he might accomplish his stated goal of uniting the party, although he has also declared that he'll go it alone if he can't bring the party along. The party would like to be brought along. Books will be written about what the much-maligned party establishment should have done and could have done to ward off Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's nomination. But the truth is that he won decisively because he speaks directly and plainly to the anxieties that the Republican base feels. He deserves credit for acknowledging their economic despair and mounting fears about Islamic extremism.\par \par \uc2 The problem with Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's campaign lies in the solutions he proposes -- a lurch toward the isolationism, protectionism and nativism that President George W. Bush worried about when he faced difficulty mustering support for trade pacts, immigration reform and war in the Middle East.\par \par \uc2 And the problem with the party's waiting game is that it replaces the sorts of activities that a fully functioning campaign should be doing. Before he flew to Scotland last week, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  delivered a professionally written speech from a teleprompter criticizing Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 . A campaign firing on all cylinders would have then flooded the battleground states with events by surrogates -- Republican governors and senators who could echo his message in the local news media. It would also have announced paid advertising and appearances in crucial states. Not a trip to a Scottish golf course. Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  managed to stay off the TV programs that often send him wildly off message, but the speech wasn't followed by any sustained strategy to reinforce the case he laid out against \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 In fact, most of the would-be surrogates have been too busy rebuking Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  for his post-Orlando dalliance with conspiracy theories and his attacks on a federal judge he deemed to be biased against him to take part in a strategy session.\par \par \uc2 Even being \uc2 Trump\uc2  surrogates probably causes them enough concern. They're probably worried that the swing voters they are counting on to return them to the House or Senate will be turned off by a candidate at the top of the ticket who disparages women, mocks disabled people and pokes fun at prisoners of war for getting captured in the first place. It counts as progress at this point that party leaders have not had any reason to condemn a \uc2 Trump\uc2  statement for at least seven days.\par \par \uc2 For his part, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  is waiting for respect. He believes he deserves the party's admiration for his political achievements, his success as a businessman and his potential to transform and broaden the party's appeal. He is brand new at the business of politics, and he vanquished the aspirations of 16 accomplished rivals in less time than it took \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  to shake off Bernie Sanders. Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  is waiting for party leaders to stop reprimanding him for his lean (that is, skeletal) campaign operation, his politically incorrect statements and his inconsistent positions. You can almost see him in his office in \uc2 Trump\uc2  Tower turning to \uc2 Chris Christie\uc2 , whom he's come to rely on at moments of crisis, and saying: ''Chris, what gives with these hand-wringers? Don't they want to win?''\par \par \uc2 He also seems to be waiting for the news media to realize that the joke is on them. He manipulates many in the media, stroking their egos by offering enormous access, long phone calls to reporters and frequent appearances on his favorite television programs. While it annoys Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  to be criticized, he understands what \uc2 Sarah Palin\uc2  understood -- his supporters are rooting for him, not the talking heads on TV. So when pundits count him down or out, his fans defend their guy against the arrogant members of the ''rigged'' media, whom Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  lovingly describes as ''among the most dishonest I have ever met.''\par \par \uc2 Those in Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's inner circle are waiting for the political conversation to turn to events that they believe will determine the outcome of the \uc2 election\uc2 : the vice-presidential pick, the conventions and the debates. Governor Christie, who has been given the vital behind-the-scenes assignment of head of the presidential transition, points out that even a politically weakened Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  still bests his Democratic opponent in a recent poll on questions about trustworthiness, fixing Washington and fighting terrorism.\par \par \uc2 To that end, his advisers are waiting for their candidate to recognize that learning just a few more things about national security and counterterrorism might reverse his June nose-dive. Even polls in battleground states taken during what has been Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's worst month in his bid for president show that he's neck-and-neck with Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  on questions about who can better protect the country. Those advisers must be waiting for the night when Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  goes to bed with a copy of ''The Looming Tower'' instead of his iPhone and \uc2 Twitter\uc2  feed.\par \par \uc2 As I recall all too well from my dating days, waiting for a man to change is a fool's errand, but in the case of Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , it may be the fools' only choice.\par \par \uc2 Follow The \uc2 New York Times\uc2  Opinion section on \uc2 Facebook\uc2  and \uc2 Twitter\uc2  (@NYTOpinion), and sign up for the Opinion Today newsletter.\par \par \uc2 Nicolle Wallace, a political analyst for NBC and the author, most recently, of the novel ''Madam President,'' was a senior adviser to the 2008 John McCain presidential campaign and White House communications director for George W. Bush.\par \par \uc2 Document NYTF000020160630ec6u0002y\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 Foreign Desk; SECTA\par \b \uc2 France's Far Right Seizes Opportunity in Anti-Establishment Anger\b0\par\par\uc2 By ADAM NOSSITER; Reporting was contributed by Melissa Eddy and Victor Homola from Berlin, Elisabetta Povoledo from Rome and Beno\u238\'00\'EEt Morenne from Paris. \par \uc2 1,349 \uc2 words\par \uc2 29 June 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 10\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 PARIS -- Among the many populist movements in Europe encouraged by Britain's vote to leave the \uc2 European Union\uc2  , none was more energized than France's far-right National Front, whose leader, \uc2 Marine Le Pen\uc2 , exulted soon after the results were announced that it was ''a day of joy.''\par \par \uc2 For nearly 30 years, the National Front has been vilifying the \uc2 European Union\uc2  while striking the same anti-immigration themes that animated the campaign in Britain. Now, with Britain having demonstrated the breadth and depth of opposition to the concentration of powers in Brussels and Europe's open-borders policy, \uc2 Ms. Le Pen\uc2  is seizing the opportunity to build support for herself and her party heading into next year's presidential \uc2 election\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 ''This gives us additional legitimacy to carry forward this same debate in France,'' she told journalists on Friday, calling for a ''Frexit'' referendum.\par \par \uc2 The far-right party took particular heart that support for cutting ties with the \uc2 European Union\uc2  came from places and voters in Britain that are very similar to the National Front's base of support in France: working people who see themselves as losers from globalization; rural areas; and small and medium-size cities that feel left behind.\par \par \uc2 With President \uc2 Fran\u231\'00\'E7ois Hollande\uc2  of the governing Socialist Party lagging badly in the polls and the main center-right party wounded by internal problems, \uc2 Ms. Le Pen\uc2  is widely expected to do well enough in the initial round of presidential voting next spring to make it to the final round against a candidate from one of the mainstream parties.\par \par \uc2 Actually winning the presidency remains a more remote prospect. But the issues raised by the British vote -- sovereignty, national identity, immigration and a popular backlash against what is perceived as an out-of-touch elite -- provide \uc2 Ms. Le Pen\uc2  with a powerful platform.\par \par \uc2 In an Op-Ed in The \uc2 New York Times\uc2  on Tuesday, \uc2 Ms. Le Pen\uc2  wrote that the British vote was about one fundamental question: ''Do we want an undemocratic authority ruling our lives, or would we rather regain control over our destiny?''\par \par \uc2 The idea of a referendum in France on membership in the \uc2 European Union\uc2  was curtly dismissed by Mr. Hollande in a meeting with \uc2 Ms. Le Pen\uc2  at the \u201\'00\'C9lys\u233\'00\'E9e Palace on Saturday. The National Front is not backing down, though.\par \par \uc2 Ms. Le Pen\uc2 's niece, \uc2 Marion Mar\u233\'00\'E9chal-Le Pen\uc2 , a rising star in the party, said in a television interview on Monday that the so-called Brexit vote would inaugurate ''a Europe where one doesn't give up one's sovereignty as a nation, for the benefit of stateless bureaucrats in Brussels.''\par \par \uc2 For all the differences between France, a founding member of the bloc and a consistent force in seeking greater unity on the Continent, and Britain, which joined late and rejected membership in initiatives like the common European currency, there are enough similarities in their economies and electorates to give hope to the National Front for a breakthrough.\par \par \uc2 There are the gleaming stores and corporate headquarters of Paris, and wealth-creating, successful cities like Toulouse and Lyon. But then there is the France of abandoned villages and small towns, from which the last baker and butcher have fled, and the France of medium-size cities whose empty storefronts line main streets -- what the newspaper Le Monde on Monday called ''Ashfield-sur-Garonne'' and ''Thurrock-sur-Loire.''\par \par \uc2 ''In France, you've got to recognize the gulf between dynamic metropolises and a rural area that feels looked down on and abandoned,'' \uc2 Alain Jupp\u233\'00\'E9\uc2 , a former prime minister and likely presidential candidate for the center-right Republicans, said in Le Monde on Monday.\par \par \uc2 Sixty percent of the population lives in ''Peripheral France,'' as the French geographer and sociologist Christophe Guilluy calls it, -- ''those who are no longer useful to the economy, who live in the rural areas and the small towns,'' he said in an interview.\par \par \uc2 ''No establishment party represents these areas,'' Mr. Guilluy said. ''That's why you've got \uc2 Trump\uc2 , Brexit and the National Front,'' he added, referring to \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2  , the presumptive Republican presidential nominee\par \par \uc2 Anti-establishment anger is increasingly evident among the working-class left in France, mirroring a phenomenon in Britain in which disaffected Labour Party voters abandoned their party's traditional pro-European stance to register their displeasure with policies and political leaders they felt had left them behind.\par \par \uc2 ''They've been governing for years against their own program,'' said Jean-Marc Sanglier, a printing worker who attended an anti-Hollande demonstration in Paris last week. He was doggedly participating in the season's 10th straight march against a proposed overhaul of the country's labor laws by Mr. Hollande's increasingly market-oriented Socialists -- a betrayal in the eyes of Mr. Sanglier and his thousands of fellow marchers.\par \par \uc2 ''Brexit is exactly the same as the National Front; it's a vote based on the same sociology and demographics,'' said Mr. Guilluy, whose work has earned him the anger of the French left and much attention in the news media partly because it stresses working-class cultural anxieties in the face of immigration.\par \par \uc2 The themes that defined the referendum in Britain have also resonated in France because of the terrorist attacks of the past year and a half and the longstanding problems France has had assimilating Muslim immigrants.\par \par \uc2 When Mr. Hollande reacted to the British vote in a televised address on Friday, the first priority he cited was ''the security and defense of our Continent, to protect our frontiers.''\par \par \uc2 Nicolas Sarkozy\uc2  , the former president who is running again as a center-right Republican, called France a ''Christian country, in its culture and its mores,'' in a much remarked-on speech this month at Saint-Andr\u233\'00\'E9-lez-Lille that called attention to the country's ''cultural, moral and even spiritual identity.''\par \par \uc2 Emmanuelle Reungoat, a National Front specialist at the University of Montpellier, said the British vote ''was centralized around finding migrants a risk.''\par \par \uc2 ''In France, this could serve the National Front,'' she said. ''It's an adaptation to the agenda of the National Front.''\par \par \uc2 The British vote was also seized on to varying degrees by other far-right parties around Europe. \uc2 Geert Wilders\uc2  of the Party for Freedom in the Netherlands joined \uc2 Ms. Le Pen\uc2  in quickly calling for a referendum on membership in the bloc, although the anti-immigrant Alternative for Germany stopped short of doing the same. That party has called for a ''Europe of Nations'' -- a new emphasis on national sovereignty -- while avoiding the question of an exit from the bloc.\par \par \uc2 In Austria, the far-right Freedom Party suggested making a vote contingent on whether the \uc2 European Union\uc2  continued with its ''migration madness,'' as its leader put it. Italy's Five Star Movement, the second most popular party there, called for a nonbinding referendum on leaving the euro currency.\par \par \uc2 In France, the British vote has accentuated the split between the mainstream parties in France, none of whom are calling for an exit, and the National Front. ''It's almost as though I used a curse word,'' \uc2 Ms. Le Pen\uc2  said acidly as she left the Elys\u233\'00\'E9e after her fruitless pitch to Mr. Hollande for a referendum.\par \par \uc2 Given the array of other issues facing France, including a near-stagnant economy and high unemployment, it remains to be seen how central an issue membership in the bloc might be in the presidential race. But the National Front appears intent on using the moment.\par \par \uc2 ''I am European by civilization, and I am French by nationality,'' Ms. Mar\u233\'00\'E9chal-Le Pen said on Monday. ''I wouldn't defend this cold monster that saps European identity.''\par \par \uc2 Marine Le Pen, leader of the National Front in France, at the European Parliament in Brussels on Tuesday. She urges a French vote on European Union membership akin to last week's British one.

\par\par \b \uc2 Politics & Ideas: The Presidential Stakes Keep Climbing\b0\par\par\uc2 By William A. Galston   \par \uc2 851 \uc2 words\par \uc2 29 June 2016\par \uc2 The Wall Street Journal\par \uc2 J\par A11\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 The Hague -- After listening to a day of passionate debate about the future of Europe at the annual meeting of the \uc2 European Council on Foreign Relations\uc2  on Monday, I realized that the stakes in the U.S. presidential \uc2 election\uc2  are even higher than I had thought. The fate of the entire postwar order hangs in the balance, and with it the prospects for democracy world-wide. Without vigorous American leadership, the prospects are not bright.\par \par \uc2 Like many other peoples, Americans are turning inward, preoccupied with economic and social divisions. This is understandable, and the next president will have to address these concerns boldly and persistently. Effective international leadership always depends on a solid foundation of domestic support.\par \par \uc2 But the next president won't have the luxury of setting foreign concerns aside until the economy is fixed. Europe is in crisis. Liberal internationalism is back on its heels; ethno-nationalist populism is on the march.\par \par \uc2 The French are no less hostile to the \uc2 European Union\uc2  than are the British, and in the wake of the Brexit vote last week, Marine Le Pen's National Front is calling for a referendum to end France's membership. Germany, by far the strongest nation in Europe, is the obvious candidate for continental leadership but for historical reasons resists that role.\par \par \uc2 Meanwhile, Russia's President \uc2 Vladimir Putin\uc2  senses a historic opportunity to exploit Europe's divisions for his own purposes -- to weaken the sanctions imposed against Russia in the wake of its invasion of eastern Ukraine and annexation of Crimea, and eventually to undermine what remains of Europe's economic and military unity. It is no accident that Mr. Putin has openly extended financial support to the National Front. If Europe doesn't hold together when facing a rearmed and resurgent Russia, the gains for democracy and free markets since the fall of the Berlin Wall and the collapse of the Soviet Union may well be rolled back.\par \par \uc2 Now is the worst possible time for the U.S. to pull back and, as \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  would have it, to reframe America's relations with Europe as a transaction to be terminated if the sums don't come up right. Franklin Roosevelt understood that a democratic Europe was a vital national interest of the U.S. So did Ronald Reagan and every other postwar president. U.S. diplomacy in 2017 and beyond must reflect this core reality.\par \par \uc2 This means that the next president must abandon the rhetoric of a "pivot" to Asia, which Europeans inevitably interpret as diminished American concern for their fate. The next administration can give Europe its due without abandoning East Asia to the tender mercies of an increasingly aggressive China.\par \par \uc2 U.S. complaints about insufficient European military and diplomatic burden-sharing are a hardy perennial of trans-Atlantic relations. The complaints have proved ineffectual in the past, and now is the very worst time to press them again.\par \par \uc2 On the economic front, both \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  and \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  have rejected the proposed Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), a comprehensive trade and investment agreement among 12 nations of Asia and the Americas. Neither candidate can easily reverse this opposition, at least to the agreement's current terms.\par \par \uc2 The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) now being negotiated between the U.S. and the \uc2 EU\uc2  is another matter altogether. The European standard of living is comparable to our own, and its labor and environmental standards are in some ways tougher. Whatever the merits of the accusation that the TPP would accelerate the outsourcing of American jobs to low-wage countries, no such charge can be leveled plausibly against TTIP. If negotiations aren't completed during the current administration, the next president should accelerate the talks, aiming for an agreement by next spring.\par \par \uc2 At the same time, we should do everything we can to help the U.K. in its hour of need. President Obama's unsuccessful effort to influence the Brexit vote included the threat that if Britain left the \uc2 EU\uc2 , it would be relegated to the "back of the queue" for future trade talks. The next president should abandon this ill-judged threat and work in parallel with the TTIP talks to conclude a similar bilateral accord with the U.K.\par \par \uc2 But none of this can succeed unless the American people are persuaded that outward-facing military, diplomatic and economic arrangements are consistent with their own well-being. Increased defense spending, which enhances job-creation as well as national security, may well be needed. New measures to cushion vulnerable Americans against the wage and employment shocks created by trade are essential.\par \par \uc2 Given current circumstances, robust internationalism is inconsistent with the fiscal austerity imposed by budget sequestration, let alone \uc2 Paul Ryan\uc2 -style proposals for retrenchment in the social programs that working Americans rely on for what is left of their security. Whatever its proponents may say, a smaller government at home means retreat abroad. This is the road to disaster, and we must not take it.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=wjco20160629000091"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document J000000020160817ec6t00018\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw272\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4080\pichgoal600

We know \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  and \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  stand out as the two candidates with the worst public images in decades of presidential politics. But the pervasiveness of that sourness stands out when you examine the misgivings of each candidate's supporters.\par \par \uc2 Let's first look at the bigger backdrop. In the latest Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll conducted June 19-23, 60% of registered voters hold a negative view of Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , the presumptive Republican nominee, while 55% see Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , the presumptive Democratic pick, in a negative light. Both have seen their images deteriorate slightly in the past month, and both top any similar numbers seen by a party nominee in modern politics.\par \par \uc2 But in what may be its own record, 13% of both of the candidates' supporters say they hold a negative view of their chosen candidate. By comparison, 2% of President \uc2 Barack Obama\uc2 's supporters and 5% of \uc2 Mitt Romney\uc2 's felt that way about them at this point in 2012.\par \par \uc2 The Journal pollsters then asked a series of questions to test voter sentiment toward the worst imputed characteristics of the two candidates.\par \par \uc2 Take Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 . Is he too volatile and lacking in the right temperament for the job? Does he make statements that are offensive or intolerant? Does he lack core principles and beliefs? Do his business practices reveal a record of taking advantage of people for his gain?\par \par \uc2 In all, 60% or more of those polled said yes when asked, one by one, if those traits were serious enough to be a concern in electing Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 . But what's striking is how many of those harboring those sentiments -- which might have served to nix a candidate in a normal \uc2 election\uc2  cycle -- are \uc2 Trump\uc2  supporters. In all, at least a quarter of those who say they back Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  to be the next president cited the same levels of concern about his temperament, offensiveness and so on.\par \par \uc2 The trend is even more striking with Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 . Does she have a record of being dishonest and untrustworthy? Is she too close to Wall Street? Has she made the wrong foreign policy decisions? Is she more of the same and so much a part of the political establishment she can't make the changes the country needs?\par \par \uc2 Again, 60% or more of all respondents said yes, those characteristics are serious enough to be a concern in electing her president. But among Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's supporters, 41% said she has a record of being dishonest, 39% said she is too close to Wall Street and around a third said she made the wrong decisions on foreign policy and was more of the same.\par \par \uc2 What about that most fundamental of questions: Does this person have a background and set of values you can identify with?\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  comes in at 30% and Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  at 36%, meaning a minority of voters identify with the backgrounds and values of the two.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=wjco20160629000053"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document J000000020160817ec6t00011\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw272\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4080\pichgoal600

\par\par \b \uc2 Election\uc2  2016: Benghazi Report Spreads Blame Widely --- \uc2 Clinton\uc2  faces little new criticism in GOP-led panel's account of 2012 attack in Libya\b0\par\par\uc2 By Byron Tau   \par \uc2 729 \uc2 words\par \uc2 29 June 2016\par \uc2 The Wall Street Journal\par \uc2 J\par A4\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 WASHINGTON -- Congressional Republicans' most comprehensive report yet on the 2012 terrorist attacks in Benghazi, Libya, outlined few new criticisms of \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , highlighting more broadly what it called an array of failings by the Obama administration.\par \par \uc2 The House Select Committee on Benghazi faulted multiple agencies for lacking an overall Libya strategy, and it characterized the \uc2 U.S. government\uc2  as slow and disorganized in responding to the attacks on two diplomatic and intelligence facilities once they were under way. The report largely confirmed the existing story line -- that a group of anti-American Libyan militants stormed U.S. installations in a carefully planned assault, killing four Americans, including Christopher Stevens, the ambassador to Libya.\par \par \uc2 But the document, the last in a series of congressional investigations into the attacks, is likely to provide political fodder as it landed in the middle of a presidential campaign that is focusing in large part on questions of terrorism and security. Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , the presumptive Democratic nominee, who was secretary of state at the time of the attacks, has faced intense criticism from Republicans over the episode.\par \par \uc2 Democrats have charged that the two-year investigation was aimed solely at damaging Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's presidential aspirations. Several Republican candidates and organizations used the 2014 creation of the committee in fundraising solicitations. A staffer working for the Republicans on the committee at one point sued, alleging in his legal complaint that the committee's work was partisan, before later dropping the allegation. House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy last year in a TV interview connected the Benghazi committee to Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's slipping poll numbers at the time.\par \par \uc2 The document presented few notable facts not found by congressional committees and a State Department review board. It did portray an administration, especially Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , looking to showcase the success of the 2011 military intervention in Libya that ousted dictator Moammar Gadhafi. It found that State Department employees were preparing for Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  to potentially visit Libya in late 2012 and seeking a policy success for her to announce, including potentially the establishment of a permanent U.S. presence in Benghazi.\par \par \uc2 The report said Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  and top-level State Department officials, including Under Secretary of State for Management Patrick Kennedy, should have known about concerns that terrorist groups were operating freely in the region.\par \par \uc2 "The intelligence on which Kennedy and the secretary were briefed daily was clear and pointed -- Al Qa'ida, al Qa'ida like groups, and other regional extremists took refuge in the security vacuum created by the Libya government," the report found.\par \par \uc2 The State Department didn't respond regarding Mr. Kennedy's role. But Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , in daylong testimony before the committee last October, said the peril in Libya was widely known.\par \par \uc2 "We were certainly aware that the situation across Libya was becoming more dangerous, and that there were particular concerns about eastern Libya," Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  said. "There was never any recommendation by anyone -- the intelligence community, the \uc2 Defense Department\uc2 , the State Department officials responsible for Libya -- to leave Benghazi."\par \par \uc2 Two of the House panel's seven Republican members wrote their own addendum to the report, arguing President Barack Obama's administration misled the public about the nature of the attacks because he was locked in a tight re-\uc2 election\uc2  race at the time.\par \par \uc2 Records uncovered by the committee and released last year show that Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  emailed her daughter, Chelsea, the night of the attack saying it was perpetrated by an al Qaeda-like group. But days later, the Obama administration was saying the protest was the result of a spontaneous protest sparked by an anti-Islamic film that was circulating on the internet.\par \par \uc2 The five Democrats on the panel released their own report Monday, arguing, as they have repeatedly, that the investigation was motivated by a partisan focus on Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  herself reiterated that charge Tuesday.

\par\par \b \uc2 U.S. News: Court's Term Disappoints Conservatives\b0\par\par\uc2 By Jess Bravin   \par \uc2 864 \uc2 words\par \uc2 29 June 2016\par \uc2 The Wall Street Journal\par \uc2 J\par A3\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 WASHINGTON -- In October, the Supreme Court appeared poised to deliver long-sought conservative victories across the legal spectrum, with opinions expected to roll back affirmative action, uphold abortion restrictions, curb class actions and cut the power of public-employee unions.\par \par \uc2 That didn't happen. Justice Antonin Scalia died in February, reducing the number of conservatives on the court and creating a dynamic where it split evenly four times and also issued narrower rulings than it might have otherwise.\par \par \uc2 Justice \uc2 Anthony Kennedy\uc2 , long a swing vote, also sided with liberals on such issues as affirmative action in university admissions and tough state rules for abortion clinics, letting the court's left fend off a conservative onslaught.\par \par \uc2 "I think it's a turning point," said Ronald Rotunda, a law professor at Chapman University in Orange, Calif. "I think we've passed the high point for conservatives."\par \par \uc2 Whether conservatives regain momentum largely depends on the presidential \uc2 election\uc2 , Mr. Rotunda said. Senate Republicans have been blocking President \uc2 Barack Obama\uc2 's court nominee, U.S. Circuit Judge \uc2 Merrick Garland\uc2 , hoping to preserve the vacancy for a conservative if Republican \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  defeats Democrat \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 No matter who wins, Justice Scalia's death portends a generational change at the court, with Justices Kennedy, \uc2 Ruth Bader Ginsburg\uc2  and Stephen Breyer in their 70s or 80s.\par \par \uc2 Conservatives did prevail in some areas. The court in June blocked the Obama administration from implementing a plan to defer deportations and authorize work for some four million illegal immigrants whose children are U.S. citizens or lawful residents. The justices' 4-4 deadlock left intact a lower-court order halting the program while litigation proceeds.\par \par \uc2 Police won a major victory this month, with a 5-3 ruling permitting the use of evidence collected after illegally stopping a pedestrian. The court said that because an identification check after the illegal stop pulled up an outstanding warrant -- in this case, for a traffic violation -- the officer's subsequent search of the pedestrian was lawful.\par \par \uc2 But on nearly every big issue, the court frustrated conservative expectations. Cases that had been carefully developed by activists to capitalize on the court's rightward tilt following the 2006 retirement of Justice Sandra Day O'Connor crashed into a majority unwilling to overrule precedent.\par \par \uc2 Conservatives had lined up "test cases tailor-made for a court including Justice Scalia," said Mary Ziegler, a law professor at Florida State University.\par \par \uc2 One set of cases, for instance, was designed to build on the court's 5-4 Hobby Lobby decision in 2014, which allowed for-profit corporations to claim religious exemptions from Affordable Care Act regulations requiring employee health plans to cover contraception.\par \par \uc2 The follow-on case brought by Christian charities and universities sought to invalidate the Obama administration's workaround for religious employers that object to contraception. But the eight-member court was unable to resolve the case, instead sending it back to lower courts with a strong nudge for the plaintiffs and government to settle the dispute.\par \par \uc2 "You can see the trend continuing with the order of the court on pharmacies," Ms. Ziegler added, noting that the court on Tuesday turned away an appeal from pharmacy owners seeking a religious exemption from a Washington state law requiring drug stores to dispense all approved medication, including emergency contraception.\par \par \uc2 Justice Kennedy -- who tempered his deciding vote in Hobby Lobby with a concurring opinion encouraging compromise between the government and religious objectors -- sided with liberals to turn down the appeal, over a published dissent by three conservatives.\par \par \uc2 ---\par \par \uc2 Businesses Failed to Win Curbs on Class Actions\par \par \uc2 Corporate America had high hopes going into the term, with several cases presenting opportunities to pare back class-action litigation.\par \par \uc2 But even before the February death of Justice Antonin Scalia -- the court's most committed critic of class actions -- the rulings began to fall short of the body blow that business had sought against consumer and worker plaintiffs.\par \par \uc2 In January, the court frustrated business with a 5-4 decision allowing damages even when plaintiffs can't prove economic harm -- for example, up to $1,500 for receiving a junk text or robocall, the amount set by federal law. Over Justice Scalia's dissent, the court held that a defendant couldn't kill a class action by offering the lead plaintiff the maximum statutory damages.\par \par \uc2 Even more disappointing was a March decision that refused to bar class-action plaintiffs from using statistical evidence. Business had framed their argument as the necessary extension of a 2011 Scalia decision rejecting such evidence in a massive class-action against \uc2 Wal-Mart Stores Inc\uc2 ., only to see a 6-2 court say statistical research can fill gaps in certain cases.\par \par \uc2 To be sure, business notched some wins. Earlier in June, for instance, the court threw out a Labor Department regulation extending overtime to service advisers at a car dealership. And it handed out victories on the intellectual-property patent-law front, making it easier for patent holders to win larger financial damages from copycats and helping companies challenge weak patents that lack true originality.\par \par \uc2 -- Jess Bravin\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=wjco20160629000050"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document J000000020160817ec6t0000o\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 THE 2016 RACE\par \uc2 National Desk; SECTA\par \b \uc2 Trump\uc2 's Speech Shows the Challenge of Running on Economic Nostalgia\b0\par\par\uc2 By NEIL IRWIN \par \uc2 857 \uc2 words\par \uc2 29 June 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 17\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2  went to a suburb of Pittsburgh called Monessen on Tuesday to talk about the steel industry and talk about trade. The mix of location and topic was uniquely appropriate for a major economic speech, though probably not in the way Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  apparently intended.\par \par \uc2 ''Today I am going to talk about how to make America wealthy again,'' he said. ''We are going to put American-produced steel back into the backbone of our country. This alone will create massive numbers of jobs.''\par \par \uc2 He's right that the number of steel industry jobs -- more precisely ''iron and steel mills and ferroalloy manufacturing,'' in government data-speak -- is down by 44 percent in the Pittsburgh area since 1990, a span in which the United States entered the \uc2 North American Free Trade Agreement\uc2  and engaged in much more extensive trade with China.\par \par \uc2 But two things are worth knowing. Before Nafta was even a gleam in a trade negotiator's eye, Pittsburgh had already lost the biggest chunk of its steelworking jobs. The culprit in that era was both international competition and the introduction of mini-mills, which allowed the production of steel with far fewer man-hours. Because of that and other technological innovations that improved productivity, total American steel output is about the same now as it was in 1990, even with far fewer workers.\par \par \uc2 That steep contraction in steel production jobs has been more than counterbalanced by a rise in other types of work. The 5,100 steel production jobs lost in Pittsburgh are dwarfed by the 66,000 health care jobs gained in the same time span. Pittsburgh has often been viewed as the very model of a city moving beyond its heavy industrial history to find new prosperity in areas like health care, banking, and professional services.\par \par \uc2 And that shows the fundamental challenge Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  faces in seeking -- as he did in Tuesday's speech -- to put opposition to trade deals at the center of his economic agenda in the presidential race. The economics of nostalgia may capture the hearts of a certain portion of voters. But it is disconnected from the decades-long direction of the United States economy and the interests of the businesses that are historically a crucial part of the Republican coalition.\par \par \uc2 That shift has been one of the more remarkable turns in what has been a remarkable race. The \uc2 U.S. Chamber of Commerce\uc2  and the \uc2 National Association of Manufacturers\uc2  rapidly took to \uc2 Twitter\uc2  to blast Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's plans as likely to lead to ''higher prices, fewer jobs and a weaker economy,'' as the Chamber's official account put it.\par \par \uc2 There are very real questions about the ways trade deals have sped up a decline in American manufacturing, pumped up trade deficits and pressured wages down across the board. These complaints have been a staple of labor unions and politicians on the left for ages; \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  has pledged to renegotiate deals to be more favorable to American workers if elected.\par \par \uc2 That's what makes it striking that -- rather than temper his primary-season language criticizing trade deals -- Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  is, if anything, running to Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's left on the subject. He even cited the work of the \uc2 Economic Policy Institute\uc2 , a liberal think tank, in the speech. Notably, these were not off-the-cuff comments, but rather an enumerated platform scripted and read from a teleprompter.\par \par \uc2 But in making the utter rejection of Nafta and normalized trade relations with China central to his campaign, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  is evoking a different United States. Since peaking in World War II at 38 percent of all jobs, manufacturing employment has been on a steady downward trajectory almost continuously ever since.\par \par \uc2 Currently 8.5 percent of American jobs are in manufacturing. Anyone younger than 35 has never lived in a world where more than one in five jobs were in factories.\par \par \uc2 Some of that is surely because of more open trade with places where wages are lower. But it is also because of remarkable advances in technology that mean a huge, gleaming factory making airplane parts or industrial fasteners might need only a dozen workers to keep it running rather than a hundred. America's economy has kept growing because factory output has risen even as manufacturing employment has fallen.\par \par \uc2 As Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  faces a general \uc2 election\uc2 , the question is how much his message of economic nostalgia will resonate, particularly beyond the older Americans who mourn a lost age.\par \par \uc2 In other words, it's easy to see why the people who used to work in those 5,100 no-longer-existent steel jobs in the Pittsburgh area might vote for Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 . But how will he fare with those additional 66,000 health care workers? The answer may well determine the \uc2 election\uc2 , and the course of the United States's economic relationship with the rest of the world.\par \par \uc2 The Upshot provides news, analysis and graphics about politics, policy and everyday life.

\par\par \uc2 National Desk; SECTA\par \b \uc2 Events Upend Predicted Tilt of the Court\b0\par\par\uc2 By ADAM LIPTAK \par \uc2 1,564 \uc2 words\par \uc2 29 June 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 1\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 WASHINGTON -- Conservatives thought this Supreme Court term would be different.\par \par \uc2 Still reeling from losses last year in major cases on health care and same-sex marriage, they welcomed a new docket in October studded with cases that seemed poised to move the law to the right.\par \par \uc2 But then came two unexpected turns of events. Justice Antonin Scalia, the longest-serving member of the court's five-justice conservative wing, died. And Justice \uc2 Anthony M. Kennedy\uc2  veered left in two of the term's biggest cases, joining the court's liberals in significant decisions favoring affirmative action and abortion rights.\par \par \uc2 For the second term in a row, the court led by Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. delivered liberal decisions at a rate not seen since the famously liberal court led by Chief Justice Earl Warren in the 1950s and 1960s.\par \par \uc2 Yet the court, which ended its term on Monday, remains in a period of great transition. With one vacant seat and the possibility of more to come, it is almost certainly entering a new era, the shape of which will depend on the outcome of the presidential \uc2 election\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 For now, Justice Scalia's absence has handed Chief Justice Roberts the difficult task of steering his colleagues toward consensus in big cases. Over the past term, when he succeeded the resulting decisions were sometimes so narrow that they barely qualified as rulings. When he failed, the court either deadlocked or left him in dissent.\par \par \uc2 Before Justice Scalia died, the court had agreed to hear cases that conservative advocacy groups hoped would help business interests and Republican politicians, while dealing setbacks to public unions, colleges with racial admissions preferences and abortion providers. Just four days before his death, the court seemed to send an assertive signal, blocking the Obama administration's effort to combat global warming by regulating emissions from coal-fired power plants. The vote was 5 to 4, with the court's conservatives in the majority.\par \par \uc2 Things soon changed. Justice Scalia's death left the court's eight remaining members evenly divided along ideological lines, and a case that had threatened to cripple public unions, Friedrichs v. \uc2 California Teachers Association\uc2 , No. 14-915, illustrates the impact of his absence.\par \par \uc2 When it was argued in January, a month before Justice Scalia died, the court's conservatives seemed ready to say that forcing public workers to support unions they have declined to join violates the First Amendment. Soon after the argument, the publicly available evidence indicates, Chief Justice Roberts assigned the majority opinion to Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr., who in two earlier opinions had made clear that he was ready to overturn a 1977 decision allowing such unions to require the payments.\par \par \uc2 But in March, the month after Justice Scalia died, the court announced that it had deadlocked in the case. As is the custom, the brief order gave no reasons and did not say how the justices had voted. The decision left the 1977 precedent in place.\par \par \uc2 A second deadlock, in United States v. Texas, No. 15-674, effectively destroyed President Obama's plan to shield as many as five million immigrants from deportation. But it could have been worse for the president. While the tie vote left in place an appeals court decision blocking the effort, Justice Scalia, if he had been alive, would almost certainly have provided the fifth vote for a comprehensive rebuke to what Republicans say is a pattern of unconstitutional overreach by Mr. Obama.\par \par \uc2 The alternative to a deadlock was sometimes a muddle. In May, the court unanimously returned a major case on access to contraception, Zubik v. Burwell, No. 14-1418, to the lower courts for further consideration in the hope that the two sides could somehow settle their differences. ''The court expresses no view on the merits'' of the case, the unsigned opinion said.\par \par \uc2 If an eight-member court was deadlocked or toothless, it turned out that a seven-member court was prepared to take a major step. In Fisher v. University of Texas, No. 14-981, a long-running challenge to a race-conscious admission program at the \uc2 University of Texas, Austin\uc2 , the court was missing both Justice Scalia and Justice \uc2 Elena Kagan\uc2 , who had recused herself because she worked on the case as solicitor general.\par \par \uc2 The case had generally been viewed as a threat to affirmative action, particularly after the court agreed to take a second look at it last June. Instead, Justice Kennedy, abandoning his earlier hostility to race-conscious programs, joined the court's remaining liberals to endorse the Texas program by a 4-to-3 vote. If Justice Scalia had been alive, the case would almost certainly have ended in a deadlock.\par \par \uc2 Justice Scalia was a dominant presence on the court, and his influence could exceed the power of his single vote. But it is also possible that Justice Scalia played a role in pushing Justice Kennedy to the left. When the Fisher case was argued in December, Justice Scalia's comments from the bench brought aspects of it into vivid relief. He said that some minority students may be better off at ''a less advanced school, a slower-track school where they do well.''\par \par \uc2 ''I don't think it stands to reason,'' Justice Scalia said, ''that it's a good thing for the University of Texas to admit as many blacks as possible.''\par \par \uc2 Vikram Amar, dean of the University of Illinois College of Law, said there had been a change in tone at the court since Justice Scalia died. ''In Fisher,'' Dean Amar said, ''even though the dissent Justice Alito read from the bench was frank, it was not as barbed and incendiary as Justice Scalia's likely would have been.''\par \par \uc2 Justice Kennedy also joined the court's liberals in a 5-to-3 decision on Monday striking down parts of a restrictive Texas abortion law and strengthening the ''undue burden'' standard that the court announced in 1992.\par \par \uc2 The silencing of Justice Scalia's voice seemed to help other justices find theirs. Two weeks after Justice Scalia died, Justice \uc2 Clarence Thomas\uc2  broke a decade-long silence by asking questions from the bench.\par \par \uc2 Justice \uc2 Sonia Sotomayor\uc2 , already a major presence at arguments, took on an even larger role. This month, she wrote a lashing dissent, rooted in the concerns of the \uc2 Black Lives Matter movement\uc2 , in a case on police stops.\par \par \uc2 Justice Thomas remained the most conservative member of the court based on voting patterns this term, while Justice Sotomayor overtook Justice \uc2 Ruth Bader Ginsburg\uc2  as the most liberal one, according to an analysis by Lee Epstein, a law professor and political scientist at Washington University in St. Louis, and Kevin Quinn, a political scientist at the University of California, Berkeley.\par \par \uc2 Justice Sotomayor's votes in criminal cases also make her one of the most liberal justices since 1937, while Justice Alito is among the most conservative, to the right of even Justice Thomas.\par \par \uc2 In all, though, the justices are doing what they can to find common ground, Professor Epstein said.\par \par \uc2 ''Without Scalia, it's still the Kennedy court, but Kagan and Breyer had a very good term,'' she said. ''Both were in the majority in divided cases over 80 percent of the time, and the Democratic side of the court yet again won victories in some of the term's biggest cases.''\par \par \uc2 There have been five versions of the Roberts court since the chief justice took charge in 2005. Justice Sandra Day O'Connor left not long after, followed by Justices David H. Souter and John Paul Stevens. But the court was nonetheless ideologically stable for a decade, from the arrival of Justice Alito in 2006 to the death of Justice Scalia this year.\par \par \uc2 The court's new volatility is likely to continue for some time. Even after Justice Scalia is replaced, other openings could be on the horizon: By the time the next president is inaugurated, Justice Stephen G. Breyer will be 78, Justice Kennedy will be 80, and Justice Ginsburg will be 83.\par \par \uc2 Republican senators have vowed to block Mr. Obama's Supreme Court nominee, Judge \uc2 Merrick B. Garland\uc2 , meaning that the court will remain short-handed for some time. Even if \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  wins the presidency and Democrats make gains in the Senate, it may be spring before a new justice is confirmed.\par \par \uc2 ''The odds are more likely than not that there will be an entire next term with eight justices,'' said one leading Supreme Court advocate, Andrew J. Pincus of \uc2 Mayer Brown\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 The term that ended on Monday included a half-dozen potential blockbusters, but all of them had been put on the docket before Justice Scalia died. Since then, the court has been accepting cases in uncontroversial areas, notably intellectual property.\par \par \uc2 ''I don't think it wants to take on more cases in which it's going to be closely divided and that could end up 4-4,'' Mr. Pincus said, ''unless there is some very compelling reason to do that.''\par \par \uc2 Follow The \uc2 New York Times\uc2 's politics and Washington coverage on \uc2 Facebook\uc2  and \uc2 Twitter\uc2 , and sign up for the First Draft politics newsletter.\par \par \uc2 Even after the current vacancy is filled, other Supreme Court openings could be on the horizon given three justices' ages.

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Across New York on Tuesday night, incumbents in the state's congressional primaries appeared to be on track to keep their seats, while the aftereffects of the presidential primary season rippled through other contests, setting up unpredictable clashes over the balance of power in the House of Representatives in the fall.\par \par \uc2 Breezing past their challengers: Representative Gregory W. Meeks, of the Fifth District, which covers a large chunk of Queens and parts of Nassau County; Representative Nydia M. Vel\u225\'00\'E1zquez, of the Seventh, which includes parts of northern Brooklyn and Queens; Representative Jerrold L. Nadler, of the 10th, which runs down the West Side of Manhattan and into southern Brooklyn; Representative Carolyn B. Maloney, of the 12th, which straddles the East River to cover eastern Manhattan, waterfront Queens and northern Brooklyn; and Representative Jos\u233\'00\'E9 E. Serrano, of the 15th, in the Bronx.\par \par \uc2 All five, who are Democrats, will have an even easier time of it in the general \uc2 election\uc2 , given that their districts are deep blue.\par \par \uc2 But in other cases, Tuesday's matchups were but a prelude to November's, in which every seat not safely in partisan territory will be buffeted by the uncertain effects of having \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2  at the top of the Republican ticket.\par \par \uc2 Democrats are hoping that an aversion to Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  will help them pick up more seats in the Republican-controlled House of Representatives than they otherwise would in the fall, though the presumptive Republican presidential nominee is popular in parts of upstate New York and Long Island.\par \par \uc2 The ramifications of \uc2 Trump\uc2 's candidacy will be tested in districts like the First, on Long Island, where the Republican incumbent, Lee Zeldin, is a stout \uc2 Trump\uc2  supporter. Two Democrats -- Anna Throne-Holst, a former Southampton town supervisor, and Dave Calone, a venture capitalist and a former federal prosecutor -- were battling for the chance to challenge him, with Ms. Throne-Holst holding on to a very slim lead around 11 p.m. on Tuesday.\par \par \uc2 One high-profile contest centered on the 19th District, in the Hudson Valley, where Zephyr Teachout, a law professor who made her political name with an unexpectedly rugged challenge to \uc2 Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo\uc2  in the 2014 primary, blew past Will Yandik, an environmentalist and farmer, in the Democratic primary. Ms. Teachout, who was backed by Senator Bernie Sanders, is running to replace Representative Chris Gibson, a Republican who had considered running for governor in 2018 but decided instead to retire from politics.\par \par \uc2 The Republican results in the 19th on Tuesday night began as more of a muddle, in large part because of an unexplained error on the ballots sent to more than 50 Columbia County polling sites.\par \par \uc2 Only two candidates were running -- John Faso, a former state assemblyman who also made an unsuccessful bid for the governor's office, and Andrew Heaney, a businessman. But a third candidate, Bob Bishop, was mistakenly included on the ballot, even though he dropped out several weeks ago.\par \par \uc2 With optical scanning machines prepared for only two candidates, votes for Mr. Faso, who was listed third, were coming up as blanks. Though the county Board of Elections had distributed corrected ballots by midafternoon Tuesday, any ballots cast before then had to be counted by hand, said Greg Fingar, the chairman of the county Republicans.\par \par \uc2 It made little, if any, difference: Mr. Faso, the favorite going in, was declared the winner.\par \par \uc2 In the 13th District, nine candidates were vying to replace Representative Charles B. Rangel, with Adriano D. Espaillat and Keith L. T. Wright considered the front-runners.\par \par \uc2 In Long Island's Third District, Tom Suozzi, a former Nassau County executive, defeated four other Democrats for the nomination to replace Representative Steve Israel, a former Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee chairman, who is leaving Congress after 16 years.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Suozzi will face State Senator Jack M. Martins, a Republican, in the fall.\par \par \uc2 Representative Sean Patrick Maloney, a Democrat, will try to hold his seat in the northern suburbs of Westchester and the lower Hudson Valley against Phil Oliva, an adviser to Rob Astorino, the Westchester County executive, who won the Republican primary over Kenneth Del Vecchio, a filmmaker and \uc2 Trump\uc2  supporter.\par \par \uc2 The Democratic primary in the 24th District, which includes Syracuse, was seen as a test for the clout of Mr. Sanders, who had endorsed Eric Kingson, a Social Security expert. Mr. Kingson lost to the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee-backed Colleen Deacon, a former aide to Senator Kirsten E. Gillibrand, who will go on to challenge Representative John Katko, the Republican incumbent.\par \par \uc2 Another Republican incumbent in central New York, Representative Richard Hanna of the 22nd District, is retiring. The Republican nominee to replace him will be Claudia Tenney, a state assemblywoman, who defeated George K. Phillips, who has twice unsuccessfully run for the seat, and Steven M. Wells, a businessman, on Tuesday night.\par \par \uc2 The Democratic candidate, Kim Myers, a businesswoman from Binghamton, was unopposed.\par \par \uc2 Document NYTF000020160629ec6t0005m\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 LETTER FROM AMERICA\par \uc2 National Desk; SECT\par \b \uc2 Handicapping the Odds of a \uc2 Clinton\uc2  Landslide\b0\par\par\uc2 By JOHN HARWOOD \par \uc2 693 \uc2 words\par \uc2 29 June 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 The New York Times on the Web\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Based on evidence from the last three decades, polarization in American politics has eliminated landslide presidential victories.\par \par \uc2 But could \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2  trigger one again?\par \par \uc2 His extraordinary White House bid has raised the question. For \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , now leading solidly in the polls, it looms over strategic choices ranging from selection of a running mate to how she contrasts herself with the presumptive Republican nominee.\par \par \uc2 In theory, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's message of change, iconoclastic background and stances on issues from taxes to trade create the possibility of appealing broadly across a divided electorate.\par \par \uc2 In practice, his tempestuous persona, harsh rhetoric and thin preparation have repelled important segments of his own Republican Party as well as Democratic constituencies.\par \par \uc2 In a Washington Post/ABC News poll last week, nearly one-third of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents, and two-thirds of voters over all, characterized Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  as unqualified.\par \par \uc2 Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  led by 12 percentage points, larger than any \uc2 Election\uc2  Day margin in the past seven presidential contests. In the \uc2 New York Times\uc2  polling average, she leads Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , 45 percent to 39 percent.\par \par \uc2 For more than three decades after World War II, lopsided presidential victories occurred regularly. In the 1950s, Dwight Eisenhower twice reached 55 percent or more of the popular vote.\par \par \uc2 Lyndon Johnson, in 1964, and Richard Nixon, in 1972, topped 60 percent. Ronald Reagan won in 1984 with 59 percent, matching Mr. Nixon by carrying 49 states while harvesting a record 525 electoral votes.\par \par \uc2 Election\uc2  outcomes have narrowed since. \uc2 Information Age\uc2  realignment hardened party lines, making Republicans and Democrats more ideologically distinct and reducing the ability of nominees to lure crossover votes.\par \par \uc2 No one since Mr. Reagan has reached 54 percent. No one since George H. W. Bush in 1988 has reached 400 electoral votes.\par \par \uc2 ''Party lines are very rigid,'' said Alan Abramowitz, an \uc2 Emory University\uc2  expert on presidential voting. ''It precludes anyone from getting close to 60 percent of the vote.''\par \par \uc2 That comforts Republicans desperate to keep control of Congress but disheartened by Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's uneven performance, modest staff and paltry campaign treasury.\par \par \uc2 ''Even with \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  running a campaign out of the cave man era, this still has the potential to be a competitive race,'' said Scott Reed, who ran Bob Dole's 1996 presidential bid and now directs the \uc2 U.S. Chamber of Commerce\uc2 's efforts to maintain the Senate Republican majority.\par \par \uc2 The strength of Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's showing in November will be directly linked to her chances of lifting fellow Democrats.\par \par \uc2 In recent economic and national security speeches, she has cast the broadest possible net by attacking Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  on personal rather than ideological grounds.\par \par \uc2 ''He is not just unprepared, he is temperamentally unfit,'' Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  said. Subsequent endorsements of Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  by Brent Scowcroft, national security adviser for the elder president Bush, and \uc2 Henry Paulson\uc2 , Treasury secretary for the younger, buttressed her argument.\par \par \uc2 The choice of a running mate represents another strategic landmark.\par \par \uc2 Some \uc2 Clinton\uc2  allies favor Elizabeth Warren, reasoning that the fiery Massachusetts senator would stoke enthusiasm among liberals drawn to Bernie Sanders in Democratic primaries. Cultural and demographic changes, they argue, make the party's base wide enough to win.\par \par \uc2 Those who are hoping for a larger victory talk of a more muted choice with broader appeal, like Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia. More improbably, she could aim big by selecting a compatible Republican -- say, \uc2 Robert M. Gates\uc2 , who served as defense secretary under Presidents George W. Bush and Obama.\par \par \uc2 Big in 2016 won't be big by historical standards in any case. Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , seeking to become America's first female president, carries more political baggage than Mr. Obama did in running to become the first African-American one.\par \par \uc2 The strategist David Axelrod recalls his 2008 victory as ''a magic carpet ride,'' with an outgoing Republican incumbent bogged down by war, financial crisis, and approval ratings below 30 percent. Mr. Obama won by seven percentage points with 365 electoral votes.\par \par \uc2 ''Can you do the 49-state kind of thing?'' Mr. Axelrod asked. ''I think the answer to that is no.''\par \par \uc2 Document NYTF000020160629ec6t00057\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

Thomas Kaplan contributed reporting from New York. \par \uc2 1,372 \uc2 words\par \uc2 29 June 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 1\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 MONESSEN, Pa. -- \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2  vowed on Tuesday to rip up international trade deals and start an unrelenting offensive against Chinese economic practices, framing his contest with \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  as a choice between hard-edge nationalism and the policies of ''a leadership class that worships globalism.''\par \par \uc2 Speaking in western Pennsylvania, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  sought to turn the page on weeks of campaign turmoil by returning to a core set of economic grievances that have animated his candidacy from the start. He threatened to withdraw from the \uc2 North American Free Trade Agreement\uc2  and pledged to label China a currency manipulator and impose punitive tariffs on Chinese goods.\par \par \uc2 He attacked Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  on her past support for the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a trade pact negotiated by the Obama administration, and challenged her to pledge that she would void the agreement in its entirety. Noting that Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  had backed free-trade agreements like Nafta in the past, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  warned, ''She will betray you again.''\par \par \uc2 At a rally later in the day in eastern Ohio, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  attacked the Trans-Pacific Partnership in more provocative terms, saying it was a ''rape of our country.''\par \par \uc2 As a policy manifesto, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's Pennsylvania speech was an attack on the economic orthodoxy that has dominated the Republican Party since World War II. It is an article of faith among establishment Republicans and allied groups like the \uc2 U.S. Chamber of Commerce\uc2 , which represents the interests of large corporations, that trade is good and more trade is better.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , by contrast, has made blistering attacks on trade his primary economic theme. In his address he rejected the standard view that countries benefit by importing goods, arguing that globalization helped ''the financial elite,'' while leaving ''millions of our workers with nothing but poverty and heartache.''\par \par \uc2 It is a critique that has been leveled for years, mainly by a small group of liberal economists who have gained little traction even on the Democratic side. On Tuesday, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  not only embraced their views, but also cited the work of the liberal \uc2 Economic Policy Institute\uc2  by name.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , as president, would have significant authority to raise trade barriers, and his speech Tuesday included his most detailed account to date of his plans to do so, saying that he would pull the United States from Nafta if Mexico and Canada did not agree to renegotiate it.\par \par \uc2 But it is far from clear that any president has the power to reverse globalization. Under existing law, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  could impose tariffs only on specific imports. The most likely effect would be to shift production to other low-cost nations.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's address opened his first swing-state tour of the general \uc2 election\uc2  race. After he muddled around the political map since his last Republican rivals withdrew, and veered away from the campaign last week for a trip to Scotland, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's tour this week through Pennsylvania and Ohio was the start of a concerted effort to carve a path to 270 electoral votes on daunting political terrain.\par \par \uc2 The language and location of Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's speech encapsulated his aspirational strategy for the general \uc2 election\uc2 : His greatest source of support has been white working-class men, and his campaign hopes to compete in traditionally Democratic-leaning states, like Pennsylvania and Michigan, to offset his deep unpopularity with Hispanic voters and women, which may put swing states like Florida and Colorado out of reach.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  delivered his address at a steel plant in the heart of coal country, on a stage flanked by blocks of compressed steel wiring, aluminum cans and other metals. And for the second time in two weeks, he spoke carefully from a script. Aides to Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , who has faced criticism throughout the race for factual exaggerations and outright falsehoods, circulated a copy of the speech with 128 footnotes documenting its claims.\par \par \uc2 Still, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  could not resist the occasional ad-libbed line to skewer Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  or boast of his own achievements. He said, for example, that he had forced her to use the term ''radical Islamic terrorism.''\par \par \uc2 And he took credit for pressuring Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  to oppose the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal, though at the time she faced far greater pressure from a primary challenge on the left, from Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's speech drew rebukes from two sides: The \uc2 Clinton\uc2  campaign attacked his credibility as a critic of free trade, and deployed Senator Sherrod Brown of Ohio, a populist Democrat who is viewed as a potential running mate for Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , to accuse Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  of hypocrisy.\par \par \uc2 ''With all of his personal experience profiting from making products overseas, \uc2 Trump\uc2 's the perfect expert to talk about outsourcing,'' Mr. Brown said, reciting a list of \uc2 Trump\uc2  products, from suits to picture frames, that he said were made in other countries. ''We know just in my state alone where \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  could have gone to make these things,'' he added.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  also drew a cold response from traditionally Republican-leaning interests for his heated attacks on international trade agreements. The \uc2 U.S. Chamber of Commerce\uc2 , which spends millions of dollars in federal elections, almost entirely in support of Republican candidates, criticized Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's speech on \uc2 Twitter\uc2  and claimed that his policies would hurt the economy.\par \par \uc2 ''Even under best-case scenario, \uc2 Trump\uc2 's tariffs would strip us of at least 3.5 million jobs,'' the group wrote in one \uc2 Twitter\uc2  message.\par \par \uc2 For Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , who has shifted and doubled back on high-profile policy pronouncements, trade has been a rare area of consistency in the 2016 race.\par \par \uc2 At nearly every campaign rally, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  has knocked trade deals with China as unfair to the American worker so frequently as to make his percussive pronunciation of China a hallmark of impersonators.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  appeared in his speech to pre-empt criticism from economists and business groups that have argued his policy proposals would lead to a damaging trade war with China and perhaps other countries.\par \par \uc2 ''We already have a trade war,'' Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  told the crowd, departing from his prepared remarks. ''And we're losing, badly.''\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , who has struggled for months to win support from the conservative business community, also attended a fund-raiser in West Virginia on Tuesday hosted by a coal executive, Robert E. Murray.\par \par \uc2 It remains to be seen if Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  will stick closely to the trade-focused message he delivered in Pennsylvania. At an evening rally in eastern Ohio, he returned to a familiar set of red-meat themes, calling for a wall on the Mexican border and reiterating his vow to waterboard Islamic State terrorists.\par \par \uc2 But to win that state in November, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  hopes to outflank Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  with economically distressed voters who may have voted Democratic in the past, and trade remains an issue that stirs up voters across party lines.\par \par \uc2 In a nod to potential crossover voters, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  at one point on Tuesday quoted Mr. Sanders by name in criticizing Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Though he dwelled at greatest length in Pennsylvania on what he described as the damaging economic consequences of globalization, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  also laced his remarks with broader nationalist language, arguing that the United States would lose its sovereignty and national pride by negotiating too freely with the world.\par \par \uc2 ''They get the expansion. We get the joblessness,'' Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  said of trade deals with foreign countries. ''That's the way it works -- not going to happen anymore.''\par \par \uc2 Find out what you need to know about the 2016 presidential race today, and get politics news updates via \uc2 Facebook\uc2 , \uc2 Twitter\uc2  and the First Draft newsletter.\par \par \uc2 In Monessen, Pa., Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2  threatened to withdraw from Nafta, label China a currency manipulator and impose punitive tariffs on Chinese goods.; Ellen and Bob Rush, left, waited Tuesday for Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  to speak on the economy at a steel plant in Monessen.

\par\par \uc2 National Desk; SECTA\par \b \uc2 Benghazi Panel Finds No Misdeeds by \uc2 Clinton\b0\par\par\uc2 By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN; Eric Schmitt contributed reporting. \par \uc2 1,490 \uc2 words\par \uc2 29 June 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 1\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 WASHINGTON -- Ending one of the longest, costliest and most bitterly partisan congressional investigations in history, the House Select Committee on Benghazi issued its final report on Tuesday, finding no new evidence of culpability or wrongdoing by \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  in the 2012 attacks in Libya that left four Americans dead.\par \par \uc2 The 800-page report delivered a broad rebuke of the \uc2 Defense Department\uc2 , the \uc2 Central Intelligence Agency\uc2  and the State Department -- and the officials who led them -- for failing to grasp the acute security risks in Benghazi, and especially for maintaining outposts there that they could not protect.\par \par \uc2 The committee, led by Representative Trey Gowdy, Republican of South Carolina, also harshly criticized an internal State Department investigation that it said had allowed officials like Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , then the secretary of state, to effectively choose who would examine their actions. In addition, it included some new details and context about the night of the attacks on the American diplomatic compound and reiterated Republicans' complaints that the Obama administration had sought to thwart the investigation by withholding witnesses and evidence.\par \par \uc2 The report, which included perhaps the most exhaustive chronology of the attacks to date, did not dispute that United States military forces stationed in Europe could not have reached Benghazi in time to rescue the personnel who died -- a central finding of previous inquiries.\par \par \uc2 Still, it issued stinging criticism of the overall delay in response and the lack of preparedness on the part of the government.\par \par \uc2 ''The assets ultimately deployed by the \uc2 Defense Department\uc2  in response to the Benghazi attacks were not positioned to arrive before the final, lethal attack,'' the committee wrote. ''The fact that this is true does not mitigate the question of why the world's most powerful military was not positioned to respond.''\par \par \uc2 But the lack of any clear finding of professional misconduct or dereliction of duty was certain to fuel further criticism of the length of the investigation -- more than two years -- and the expense, estimated at more than $7 million. It also bolstered Democrats' allegations that the inquiry was specifically intended to damage Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's presidential prospects.\par \par \uc2 After a campaign stop in Denver, Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  said that the investigation had uncovered nothing to contradict past findings, and that the House committee's work had assumed a ''partisan tinge.''\par \par \uc2 ''I'll leave it to others to characterize this report,'' she said, ''but I think it's pretty clear it's time to move on.''\par \par \uc2 Yet even as Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  seemed eager to press forward, she must still contend with the fallout from the committee's most significant, if inadvertent, discovery: that she exclusively used a private email server during her four years as secretary of state. That revelation has spurred separate investigations into whether classified material was mishandled, including a continuing inquiry by the F.B.I.\par \par \uc2 In a sign that Mr. Gowdy was also facing pressure from the right, two of the committee's conservative members, Representatives Jim Jordan of Ohio and Mike Pompeo of Kansas, wrote a 48-page addendum including somewhat harsher criticism of Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  and the Obama administration.\par \par \uc2 After the attack, ''with the presidential \uc2 election\uc2  just 56 days away, rather than tell the American people the truth and increase the risk of losing an \uc2 election\uc2 , the administration told one story privately and a different story publicly,'' Mr. Jordan and Mr. Pompeo wrote.\par \par \uc2 Technically, the report is not final until the full committee formally votes to accept it, which it is scheduled to do July 8.\par \par \uc2 Among the committee's chief findings:\par \par \uc2 \u226\'00\'E2\u8211\'20\'13\u160\'00\'A0 Despite authorization from President Obama, no American military forces were deployed to Benghazi on the night of the attacks, and Marines stationed in Spain repeatedly received conflicting orders.\par \par \uc2 \u226\'00\'E2\u8211\'20\'13\u160\'00\'A0 The Libyan forces that helped evacuate Americans from a C.I.A. annex to the Benghazi airport were not part of militias allied with the United States, but were fighters previously loyal to Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi of Libya.\par \par \uc2 \u226\'00\'E2\u8211\'20\'13\u160\'00\'A0 Susan E. Rice, then the United States ambassador to the United Nations, made numerous false statements about the Benghazi attack on television that one State Department press officer described in an email as ''off the reservation on five networks!''\par \par \uc2 \u226\'00\'E2\u8211\'20\'13\u160\'00\'A0 Senior State Department officials -- including Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's chief of staff, \uc2 Cheryl D. Mills\uc2  -- exerted too much influence over the Accountability Review Board that conducted the department's own inquiry, casting doubt on its independence and findings.\par \par \uc2 \u226\'00\'E2\u8211\'20\'13\u160\'00\'A0 The Obama administration repeatedly sought to obstruct the select committee's investigation by delaying or refusing to respond to requests for documents and testimony.\par \par \uc2 The committee made scant mention of procedures put in place since the Benghazi attacks, which fundamentally changed the way American embassies and consulates operate.\par \par \uc2 The State Department has taken a maximalist approach to security that some diplomats now say makes it difficult for them to carry out their responsibilities. The \uc2 Defense Department\uc2  has increased the number of Marine guards at diplomatic posts and created new crisis-response teams.\par \par \uc2 Democrats on the committee complained that they had been excluded from decisions on the report, and noted that the Benghazi investigation had dragged on longer than the inquiries into the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks; the assassination of President John F. Kennedy; the attack on Pearl Harbor; and the response to Hurricane Katrina.\par \par \uc2 In the most dramatic confrontation over the two years of the investigation, Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  testified before the committee for more than eight hours in October. The hearing was widely perceived to have backfired on Republicans, as she answered their questions and coolly deflected their attacks.\par \par \uc2 By the time of her testimony, Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  had already taken responsibility for the State Department's handling of the attacks.\par \par \uc2 Previous investigations concluded that State Department officials had erred in not better securing the diplomatic compound amid reports of a deteriorating security situation. But they also determined that the attacks had come with little warning and that it would have been difficult to intervene once they had begun.\par \par \uc2 The investigations generally concluded that after the attack, the Obama administration's talking points were flawed but not deliberately misleading.\par \par \uc2 The Pentagon had no forces that could be readily sent to Benghazi when the crisis began. The closest AC-130 gunship was in Afghanistan. There were no armed drones within range of Libya. There was no Marine expeditionary unit, a large seaborne force with its own helicopters, in the Mediterranean Sea.\par \par \uc2 The Africa Command also did not have on hand a force able to respond rapidly to emergencies. Every other regional command had one at the time. The Pentagon was caught unprepared for this type of crisis.\par \par \uc2 On the night of the attacks, the Pentagon was able to divert an unarmed Predator drone operating 90 miles away to Benghazi, and the C.I.A. later used it to help plan an escape route for the surviving Americans. But other military forces were too far away or could not be mobilized in time, military commanders have said.\par \par \uc2 The unclassified version of an independent 2012 report, headed by Thomas R. Pickering, a former diplomat, concluded that ''there simply was not enough time, given the speed of the attacks, for armed U.S. military assets to have made a difference.''\par \par \uc2 But that report did not address whether it would have been prudent to station quick-reaction forces in the region, a step the Pentagon has since taken.\par \par \uc2 At a news conference at the Capitol on Tuesday, Mr. Gowdy praised as heroes the Americans who died in the attacks on Sept. 11, 2012. They included Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens and Sean Smith, a State Department information officer, who were killed at the main American diplomatic compound in Benghazi by a mob of militia fighters who had been incited by an American-made video deriding the Prophet Muhammad. The fighters were apparently further inflamed by news of an assault on the American Embassy in Cairo.\par \par \uc2 Two other Americans, Tyrone S. Woods and Glen A. Doherty, who were contractors for the C.I.A., died later when a separate annex run by the agency was hit by mortars. The attacks spanned about eight hours.\par \par \uc2 At the time the select committee was created, there had been at least seven congressional inquiries into the Benghazi attacks in addition to the State Department's review, with all of them reaching much the same conclusion.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Gowdy urged Americans to read all 800 pages of the report. ''You can read this report from pillar to post in less time than our fellow Americans were under attack in Benghazi,'' he said.\par \par \uc2 Follow The \uc2 New York Times\uc2 's politics and Washington coverage on \uc2 Facebook\uc2  and \uc2 Twitter\uc2 , and sign up for the First Draft politics newsletter.\par \par \uc2 Trey Gowdy, the Republican who led the House select committee on the 2012 Benghazi attacks.

\par\par \b \uc2 Election\uc2  2016: New Poll Finds Opening For Third-Party Candidates\b0\par\par\uc2 By Peter Nicholas   \par \uc2 743 \uc2 words\par \uc2 28 June 2016\par \uc2 The Wall Street Journal\par \uc2 J\par A4\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 Deep dislike for the two leading presidential candidates is creating an opening for third-party hopefuls, potentially scrambling the race as voters cast about for alternatives, a new Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll shows.\par \par \uc2 With majorities of registered voters holding negative views of Democrat \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  and Republican \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2 , two other candidates notched a level of support that could prove meaningful in a tight race.\par \par \uc2 Libertarian \uc2 Gary Johnson\uc2  and Green Party candidate Jill Stein together drew backing from 16% of the 1,000 people surveyed. When voters had the option of choosing the third-party candidates, Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's lead over Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  dropped from 5 percentage points to 1 point.\par \par \uc2 The presence of third-party candidates on the ballot could add a measure of unpredictability to the \uc2 election\uc2 . The Libertarian Party expects to be on the ballot in all 50 states, the Green Party in at least three-quarters of states.\par \par \uc2 Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  led Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  by 46% to 41% when voters were asked which of the two they favored. Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  led by only a single point, 39% to 38%, when voters could also choose Mr. Johnson or Ms. Stein.\par \par \uc2 On the four-candidate ballot, some 83% of those who favored Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  in a two-way race stuck with her as their preference, while 13% split off and threw their support to Mr. Johnson or Ms. Stein.\par \par \uc2 Given the same choices, 89% of \uc2 Trump\uc2  voters stayed loyal to him, while 9% moved to Mr. Johnson or Ms. Stein.\par \par \uc2 The poll also shows that independent voters could be an important factor in the \uc2 election\uc2 . Polling in the fall of 2012 found that only 11% of independents favored third-party candidates in that presidential race, compared with 35% in the new Journal/NBC News survey, which was conducted June 19-23.\par \par \uc2 Indeed, Mr. Johnson outpaced Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  among independents, 23% to 15%, in the new poll.\par \par \uc2 Those whose views on the race haven't hardened seem open to choosing Mr. Johnson or Ms. Stein. These "persuadable" voters comprised nearly three in 10 of those surveyed.\par \par \uc2 Of them, 28% leaned toward Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  and 25% toward Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 . Some 21% favored Mr. Johnson and 12% went for Ms. Stein.\par \par \uc2 Pollsters cautioned that voters are more apt in the summer before an \uc2 election\uc2  to say they will back third-party candidates. When the race heats up in the fall, they often revert to the major-party contenders.\par \par \uc2 Yet the 2016 presidential race has often defied conventional thinking. One difference between this \uc2 election\uc2  and past ones is the unpopularity of the two main candidates.\par \par \uc2 Some 55% of voters said in the new survey that they saw Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  in a negative light. For Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , the figure was 60%. The ratings are worse than those of any Republican or Democratic nominee dating to 1992.\par \par \uc2 When asked if they backed Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  or Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  in the general \uc2 election\uc2 , 9% told the interviewers that they would vote for neither.\par \par \uc2 The poll suggests that voters feel little personal connection to either candidate. Asked if they shared Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's values, 36% said yes while 61% said no. Only 30% said they shared Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's values, compared with 68% who said they didn't. Those numbers are far worse than for any of the Republican and Democratic nominees in 2008 and 2012.\par \par \uc2 On this measure, Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  has lost ground compared with her first presidential bid, in 2008. In April of that year, voters were evenly split on the question of whether they shared her values.\par \par \uc2 Fred Yang, a Democratic pollster who conducted the Journal/NBC News survey with Republican Bill McInturff, said: "This really will be an \uc2 election\uc2  in which voters will be holding their noses."\par \par \uc2 Mr. McInturff said: "Given the historic dissatisfaction with the two major-party candidates, there's an opening for a larger share of the vote for the third- and fourth-party candidates than we've seen since [Ross] Perot."\par \par \uc2 Running as an independent in 1992, Mr. Perot captured 19% of the vote, finishing behind Republican President George H.W. Bush and then-Arkansas Gov. Bill \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , who won the \uc2 election\uc2 . Mr. Perot ran again in 1996 and finished with 8% of the vote.\par \par \uc2 The poll had a margin of error of plus or minus 3.1 percentage points.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=wjco20160628000047"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document J000000020160720ec6s0003v\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw272\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4080\pichgoal600

\par\par \b \uc2 Election\uc2  2016: \uc2 Trump\uc2  Appears to Backpedal on Muslim Ban\b0\par\par\uc2 By Beth Reinhard and Damian Paletta   \par \uc2 529 \uc2 words\par \uc2 28 June 2016\par \uc2 The Wall Street Journal\par \uc2 J\par A4\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  appears to be backing away from one of his signature and most controversial proposals -- banning Muslims from entering the U.S. -- as polls show him falling slightly behind \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Since Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  essentially clinched the GOP presidential nomination in May, amid widespread popularity of his proposed ban among primary voters, he has gradually moved away from a blanket religious ban and toward a more nuanced policy targeting countries with a record of terrorism.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's policy director, Stephen Miller, said in an interview with The Wall Street Journal on Monday, "The best way to prevent continued radicalization from developing inside America is to suspend temporarily immigration from regions that have been a major source for terrorists and their supporters coming to the U.S."\par \par \uc2 But the evolution of the policy has come in fits and starts, with conflicting statements by Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  that have confused some of his strongest supporters on Capitol Hill. Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  has never said he was wrong about the temporary Muslim ban or explicitly said he was abandoning that policy.\par \par \uc2 Asked about the confusion, one of Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's top foreign-policy advisers, retired Rear Adm. Charles Kubic, said he was "working with the campaign to address this issue." He said he expected a statement from the campaign headquarters this week.\par \par \uc2 Campaign spokeswoman Hope Hicks said Mr. Kubic was not advising the campaign on this issue. But another \uc2 Trump\uc2  representative, Katrina Pierson, confirmed the policy was being clarified. "Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  is going to be refining his policy, putting out specifics, which everyone's been asking for," she said on \uc2 CNN\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  was tied with Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , the presumptive Democratic nominee, in late May and now lags by more than 6 percentage points, according to the Real Clear Politics polling average. The latest Wall Street Journal/NBC News survey showed him with 41% support, compared with 46% for Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Counter-terrorism and national-security experts who disagreed with a Muslim ban said a geographic immigration policy still raised concerns, because Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  so far had not detailed which countries would qualify and how he would measure their records on terrorism.\par \par \uc2 Typically, presidential candidates travel abroad to flaunt their foreign-policy chops, but Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's first trip overseas this past weekend was focused on promoting his new golf course in Scotland. When pressed by reporters for details on his national-security policies, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  said he would block immigrants from "countries with great terrorism."\par \par \uc2 Two of Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's foreign-policy advisers on Monday said they were unavailable for comment or didn't have permission to speak to reporters.\par \par \uc2 Carl Paladino\uc2 , the 2010 Republican gubernatorial nominee in New York and a top \uc2 Trump\uc2  supporter, said he didn't think Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  was changing his national-security policy.\par \par \uc2 "I don't think it was ever a ban directed at religion," said Mr. Paladino, who attended a recent speech by Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  in Manhattan that focused on banning Syrian refugees who haven't been properly vetted, rather than Muslims.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=wjco20160628000049"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document J000000020160720ec6s0003u\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw272\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4080\pichgoal600

\par\par \b \uc2 Election\uc2  2016 --- CAPITAL JOURNAL: How the 1930s Are Echoing in Today's Politics\b0\par\par\uc2 By Gerald F. Seib   \par \uc2 825 \uc2 words\par \uc2 28 June 2016\par \uc2 The Wall Street Journal\par \uc2 J\par A4\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 Lingering economic anger and anxiety. A rebellion against the existing political order. A rise of nationalism and a retreat from international entanglements.\par \par \uc2 After last week's "Brexit" vote in Britain, and amid a tumultuous U.S. presidential campaign, that sounds like a description of the political lay of the land in 2016. In fact, it's a description of global sentiment in the 1930s, which increasingly looks like the best parallel to today's environment.\par \par \uc2 The political ferment of the 1930s led to cataclysmic consequences, of course, and there's little reason to think that's where things are heading today. Still, the parallels are close enough to suggest that nobody should be surprised that a sustained period of economic anxiety and anger would lead to a flirtation with unorthodox, perhaps even radical, political experiments. A look back suggests that mainstream politicians ignore the underlying sentiments at their own risk.\par \par \uc2 The lesson of 2016 so far is that wounds and resentments from the deep recession that began in 2007 and the financial collapse of 2008 remain painful enough that they have compelled voters across the industrialized world to make choices that once would have seemed implausible. Some 13 million voted for \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  in the primary season, and 12 million for Sen. Bernie Sanders. Both were marginal figures before this year, and their messages once would have been considered well out of the mainstream.\par \par \uc2 In Europe, parties of the socialist left and nationalist right are enjoying bursts of popularity and, in some cases, actual power. In Japan, Prime Minister \uc2 Shinzo Abe\uc2  sounds nationalistic notes not heard in more than half a century. Russia's \uc2 Vladimir Putin\uc2  is thriving by reviving his nation's nationalist sentiment. And in Britain, those who have spent years grousing about ending ties to the \uc2 European Union\uc2  suddenly got their hearing -- and a shocking victory.\par \par \uc2 In all these developments, there are echoes of the 1930s. The economic event that touched off that decade's political tremors was, of course, the Great Depression, a jolt considerably worse than the recent recession.\par \par \uc2 Then as now, it took years for the political repercussions to play out. The first impact came when Democrat Franklin Roosevelt buried Herbert Hoover in the \uc2 election\uc2  of 1932 and roared into the White House with what seemed to some a radical economic prescription for pulling out of the Depression ditch.\par \par \uc2 But throughout the decade, voters also flirted with even less-conventional figures and ideas. On the left, the Progressive Party created by Robert La Follette took hold in Wisconsin. Upton Sinclair, an avowed socialist not unlike Bernie Sanders, won the Democratic nomination for governor of California in 1934.\par \par \uc2 Populism took root as well. Huey Long, a figure with distinct similarities to Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , became Louisiana's governor and, ultimately, a national figure with presidential notions. Henry Wallace's version of agricultural populism was appealing enough that he became vice president.\par \par \uc2 Harsher voices were heard as well. Father Charles E. Coughlin found that the new-media innovation of the day, a national radio network, was a perfect platform for dispersing a populist and xenophobic message, and his National Union for Social Justice became a national force.\par \par \uc2 Amid the economic distress at home, calls to retreat from the world stage took on new appeal. The sentiment actually was codified in Congress, in the form of the Neutrality Act of 1935. Pacifism became a campus fad.\par \par \uc2 The convulsions in Europe were bigger, of course. Fascists rose in Germany and Italy, and found they had cheerleaders scattered across the West, including in the U.S. Great Britain tried to avoid getting entangled in the continent's affairs, with disastrous consequences. Leaders in Moscow, meanwhile, stepped in.\par \par \uc2 Obviously, the parallels between then and now are far from exact. Most notably, today's political churning isn't accompanied by a parallel rise in militarism. In his history of the period, "The Glory and the Dream," William Manchester summarized the effects of the combination of extreme nationalism and militarism:\par \par \uc2 "Before Roosevelt's second presidential campaign, Mussolini had seized Ethiopia; Spain had burst into flame; Germany had rearmed, occupied the Rhineland...In Tokyo militant young officers drove Hirohito's government toward expansionism and imperialism."\par \par \uc2 With the possible exception of Mr. Putin taking Crimea away from Ukraine, nothing remotely like that scenario is developing today.\par \par \uc2 But for political leaders, the one takeaway is quite relevant. Public sentiments of anger and alienation aren't to be belittled or dismissed, for their causes can be legitimate and their consequences powerful.\par \par \uc2 That, ultimately, is what Mr. Roosevelt did in steering between the more extreme sentiments of left and right that were coursing around him. He showed that a conventional politician could survive and prosper -- not by dismissing the seemingly illogical emotions around him but by channeling them.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=wjco20160628000046"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document J000000020160720ec6s0003s\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 Foreign Desk; SECTA\par \b \uc2 Climate Partnership Is Key Topic at North American Leaders' Meeting\b0\par\par\uc2 By IAN AUSTEN and CORAL DAVENPORT; Ian Austen reported from Ottawa, and Coral Davenport from Washington. \par \uc2 1,453 \uc2 words\par \uc2 28 June 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 4\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 OTTAWA -- When \uc2 Justin Trudeau\uc2 , the prime minister of Canada, appeared at the United Nations this spring to sign the Paris climate accord, the rapturous ovation he received was worthy of the celebrity he had become, a leader full of promise and of promises, especially on climate change.\par \par \uc2 On Wednesday, as Canada convenes a North American Leaders' Summit here, the youthful Canadian will meet the last celebrity to emerge to such adulation on the world stage, and President Obama will have some lessons to impart. Climate change will be a central topic of the summit meeting and of Mr. Obama's address to Canada's House of Commons.\par \par \uc2 The leaders of the United States, Mexico and Canada will announce a North America-wide climate partnership, syncing their national policies to cut greenhouse gas emissions. They will pledge a joint goal of generating 50 percent of North America's electricity from zero-carbon sources by 2025, up from 37 percent today. White House officials said that power mix would include wind, solar, hydropower, nuclear energy and coal or gas power paired with carbon capture technology. They will also announce that Mexico will join an existing agreement between the United States and Canada to collectively regulate leaks of methane, a potent greenhouse gas that escapes from oil and gas wells.\par \par \uc2 But all of that will come with a note of caution. Unlike his Canadian counterpart, the American president's hair is now gray, his speeches wizened by his experiences -- and his message is likely to reflect the hard lessons he has learned as he has tried for nearly eight years to curb the climate-warming emissions of Canada's neighbor to the south.\par \par \uc2 ''Trudeau is facing the same fossil-fuel-lobby reality that Obama encountered,'' said Paul Bledsoe, a former climate adviser in the \uc2 Clinton\uc2  administration who now consults on climate policy. ''In a way, Canada is a test case for the penetration of renewable energy in a fossil-rich country.''\par \par \uc2 The parallels between the leaders are striking, even if the younger man's efforts have only begun. During his first eight months in office, Mr. Trudeau, 44, has put climate change at the heart of his agenda, after his predecessor, \uc2 Stephen Harper\uc2 , a Conservative, reneged on Canada's commitments under the first global climate pact, the Kyoto Protocol.\par \par \uc2 When President Obama, then new to office, attended the 2009 climate change summit meeting in Copenhagen, he too was cheered by environmentalists and many world leaders as a drastic departure from his predecessor, George W. Bush, a Texas oilman who had also pulled his country out of Kyoto.\par \par \uc2 But both have learned that adulation on the world stage does not necessarily translate into action at home on a problem as intractable as climate change.\par \par \uc2 After vowing in Copenhagen to make the United States a leader in the fight on global warming, Mr. Obama saw his climate change bill torpedoed in Congress. Only toward the end of his second term was he able to push through a climate policy that he had always thought of as a Plan B -- a suite of regulations on coal-fired power plants -- and those too are stalled, this time by a federal lawsuit.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Obama sees something of a kindred spirit in the prime minister.\par \par \uc2 ''On the world stage, his country is leading on climate change and cares deeply about development, so from my perspective, what's not to like?'' Mr. Obama said of Mr. Trudeau during the prime minister's state visit in March.\par \par \uc2 But on the smaller stage here in Canada's capital, Mr. Trudeau is bumping up against the same opposing forces that stymied Mr. Obama in Washington.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Trudeau has acknowledged the difficulties. ''Climate change will test our intelligence, our compassion and our will,'' he told the United Nations in April. ''But we are equal to that challenge.''\par \par \uc2 Canada's economy relies heavily on oil and gas production, particularly in Alberta, where production of petroleum from the heavily polluting oil sands is a major source of government revenue, and the global collapse of oil prices has left the region suffering. Like Mr. Obama, Mr. Trudeau is experiencing pushback to efforts to reduce oil demand.\par \par \uc2 It was Mr. Harper who submitted Canada's climate change plan to the Paris negotiations, a plan widely criticized as weak. But for all his passionate speeches about climate change, Mr. Trudeau can offer an alternative only after he works out a new pact with Canada's 10 provincial governments. So far, nothing has emerged.\par \par \uc2 ''We were excited by Trudeau in Paris -- he took an opposite stand from the previous government,'' said Laurence Tubiana, the French climate change envoy. ''But it's not easy to make policies happen.''\par \par \uc2 Indirectly, just the \uc2 election\uc2  of Mr. Trudeau helped Mr. Obama carry out a major environmental decision, the rejection of the Keystone XL oil pipeline, which would have carried nearly a million barrels of oil from Alberta's oil sands to Gulf Coast refineries. While American environmentalists begged him to reject the project, Mr. Obama delayed his decision for years in part to avoid straining relations with Canada.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Trudeau's \uc2 election\uc2  in October 2015 changed the calculus. Although a Keystone supporter, the prime minister had put the pipeline much lower on his agenda than his climate change commitments. Less than a month after his \uc2 election\uc2 , Mr. Obama rejected the pipeline.\par \par \uc2 The first time Mr. Obama called Mr. Trudeau after a congratulatory \uc2 election\uc2 -night call was to give him a heads-up about his Keystone decision. But the call grew into a broader discussion on joint climate change plans. ''That call could have gone very differently,'' said Mr. Obama's senior climate change adviser, Brian Deese. ''But instead of acrimony, they both resolved that there was a real opportunity for our countries to increase our partnership on climate change.''\par \par \uc2 The two then met at the Paris climate summit meeting a month later. Then Mr. Trudeau set Canada's bureaucracy into motion, appointing Catherine McKenna, an international trade lawyer, as his minister of environment and climate change.\par \par \uc2 ''Catherine and her team were warmly welcomed. Her message was essentially, 'Canada's back,''' said Todd Stern, the former United States climate envoy.\par \par \uc2 But Mr. Trudeau's push for a national plan to tax carbon emissions is still a matter of negotiation. Some provinces, including Alberta, Quebec and British Columbia, have put plans in place to tax or price emissions. Others have refused.\par \par \uc2 Brad Wall\uc2 , the premier of oil-producing Saskatchewan, has vowed never to sign any carbon tax agreement.\par \par \uc2 Meanwhile, in the wake of Keystone XL's failure, politicians from western Canada are pushing Mr. Trudeau to support new pipelines to the United States.\par \par \uc2 Rachel Notley\uc2 , the premier of Alberta, said she believed Mr. Trudeau was warming to the idea. ''He's become more aware of what it means for our economy, what it means to reposition and get our product to market, and get a better price for our product,'' she said.\par \par \uc2 And climate change remains a sensitive subject on both sides of the border. When the Canadian Green Party leader, \uc2 Elizabeth May\uc2 , linked a huge wildfire in Fort McMurray, Alberta, ''to the global climate crisis,'' she was rebuked by several other politicians, including Mr. Trudeau. Her comments were seen as a distasteful attempt to use the disaster for political purposes, a charge sometimes mirrored in the United States.\par \par \uc2 Still, support is growing for climate measures in Canada. Ontario, the most populous province, introduced a package of climate change measures earlier this month that included joining Quebec's cap-and-trade system, which, in turn, is linked to California's program.\par \par \uc2 Climate diplomats say that while Mr. Trudeau's international celebrity will not be enough to push through tough domestic climate policies, it will not hurt.\par \par \uc2 ''If you have Trudeau, who is a much more charismatic figure and gets press attention, then that amplifies what he says and gives a sense of momentum,'' Mr. Stern said. ''It's a good thing.''\par \par \uc2 Follow The \uc2 New York Times\uc2 's politics and Washington coverage on \uc2 Facebook\uc2  and \uc2 Twitter\uc2 , and sign up for the First Draft politics newsletter.\par \par \uc2 Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada and President Obama at the White House in March.

\par\par \uc2 Express; SECT\par \b \uc2 Obama White House Veterans Gleefully Enter the Podcast World\b0\par\par\uc2 By JONAH ENGEL BROMWICH \par \uc2 1,027 \uc2 words\par \uc2 28 June 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 The New York Times on the Web\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 David Axelrod was having a candid conversation with an old colleague when, almost accidentally, the two made some news.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Axelrod, a former senior adviser to President Obama, was talking to \uc2 Eric H. Holder Jr\uc2 ., the former attorney general, on his podcast, ''The Axe Files.'' He had asked Mr. Holder for his thoughts on Edward J. Snowden, the intelligence contractor who leaked classified documents about the \uc2 National Security Agency\uc2  in 2013.\par \par \uc2 ''We can certainly argue about the way in which Snowden did what he did, but I think that he actually performed a public service by raising the debate that we engaged in,'' Mr. Holder said.\par \par \uc2 It was the first such public admission from the man who was the top law enforcement official in the United States when Mr. Snowden fled the country. The podcast comment was covered widely in the news media.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Holder's appearance on ''The Axe Files'' made him another member of a group that might informally be called the Obama-casters. Since the president made a much-noted appearance on the popular podcast ''WTF With Marc Maron'' in June 2015, three prominent former staffers have started their own shows, sometimes securing lengthy -- and occasionally newsworthy -- interviews with their administration peers.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Axelrod's podcast, produced by the Institute of Politics at the \uc2 University of Chicago\uc2  and \uc2 CNN\uc2 , started in September. In May, Mr. Obama's former speechwriter \uc2 Jon Favreau\uc2  and Dan Pfeiffer, a former senior White House adviser, started the weekly ''Keepin' It 1600.''\par \par \uc2 Together, the two shows have hosted close to a dozen former and current members of Mr. Obama's administration, eliciting in-depth conversations with major figures including Samantha Power, the United States ambassador to the United Nations; \uc2 David Plouffe\uc2 , who managed Mr. Obama's 2008 presidential campaign; and Ben Rhodes, a national security adviser.\par \par \uc2 While administration officials often embrace media roles after leaving the White House, podcast experts say there is something about the medium that makes particular sense for this administration.\par \par \uc2 ''To a certain extent, they're doing what all White Houses do. They find out what the hot medium of the time is and they exploit it,'' said \uc2 Andy Bowers\uc2 , the co-founder of Panoply, Slate's podcast network. ''But I feel like podcasting is a medium that is perfectly in sync with the Obama White House and Obama himself.''\par \par \uc2 Mr. Maron agreed, saying that podcasts help to promote intimate personal discussions, something President Obama embraced during their conversation.\par \par \uc2 ''He's very human as presidents go, I think,'' Mr. Maron said.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Axelrod, who had not been much of a podcast listener, was taken with the format after hearing Mr. Obama on Mr. Maron's show.\par \par \uc2 ''I thought it was one of the best conversations that I'd heard him have,'' Mr. Axelrod said. ''It was revealing and interesting, and I thought 'Boy, this would be fun.' ''\par \par \uc2 Mr. Axelrod's podcast typically consists of a single in-depth interview. He has welcomed reporters and several guests from across the aisle, including \uc2 Mitt Romney\uc2 , whom he helped to defeat in the 2012 presidential \uc2 election\uc2 . (The two joked about \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2 .)\par \par \uc2 Mr. Favreau and Mr. Pfeiffer's podcast is produced by The Ringer, the new website from the sports pundit Bill Simmons. It is faster paced and usually begins with the two hosts bantering about the week in politics -- and these days, disparaging Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's presidential campaign -- before speaking with a guest. (Mr. Simmons hosted President Obama on his own show in 2012, the first time any sitting president had appeared on a podcast.)\par \par \uc2 Neither Mr. Axelrod nor Mr. Favreau sees it as part of their shows' mission to scoop their more traditional media competitors, but in separate interviews, both men acknowledged that breaking news was desirable because it helped promote their podcasts. And each said that guests would be more likely to speak genuinely without resorting to talking points if they were not expecting an inquisition.\par \par \uc2 ''A lot of the folks who are on with me, certainly the more prominent public officials, if you start asking the usual questions that they're likely to get on TV, they start giving you the likely answers,'' Mr. Axelrod said. ''And all of a sudden, it's not really a conversation anymore; it's more of a Kabuki dance.''\par \par \uc2 ''People are more likely to break news because you sit, and you're comfortable and you're having a conversation and you let your guard down a little bit more'' on podcasts, Mr. Favreau said.\par \par \uc2 The Obama administration has been experimental in its communications strategy, often resorting to newer media outlets to spread the president's message. Mr. Obama seems to have taken a liking to comedians: A frequent guest on the late-night circuit during campaigns, he has also appeared on ''Between Two Ferns,'' a satirical show hosted by the comedian Zach Galifianakis, and Jerry Seinfeld's web series ''Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee.''\par \par \uc2 ''The nature of communications in the modern era is that there is no bully pulpit anymore,'' Mr. Axelrod said of such appearances. ''You have to reassemble it all the time from different pieces, and you have to be aware of new ways of communicating in order to keep ahead of the curve.''\par \par \uc2 Administration officials have also been known to express irritation with more traditional media outlets, and Mr. Favreau said that the podcasts provide an antidote to the rushed discussion that is typical of cable news.\par \par \uc2 ''Those of us who were in the Obama White House, that was always sort of our critique of the Washington political conversation: That it was surface level, and it was a way of relaying talking points and repeating conventional wisdom,'' he said.\par \par \uc2 Asked to elaborate on similarities between the character of the Obama administration and the podcasting world, Mr. Favreau emphasized that it was important in both to have ''the time and space to have a more nuanced, subtle conversation.''\par \par \uc2 ''Everybody would say that's very Obama-like,'' Mr. Favreau said. ''Because he can be professorial.''\par \par \uc2 Follow Jonah Bromwich on Twitter @Jonesieman.\par \par \uc2 Document NYTF000020160628ec6s0006w\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 The background music of my life is the steady drumbeat of tweets about how \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  stole the presidential primary from Bernie Sanders.\par \par \uc2 It's there when I wake up in the morning. It's there when I go to sleep at night. The constant thrumming of \uc2 election\uc2  fraud conspiracists is like the noise made by that board game in the movie ''Jumanji.''\par \par \uc2 I didn't write about this during the primary season, since I didn't want to dignify the views of conspiracy theorists. But they're still going.\par \par \uc2 The allegations are remarkably consistent. They go like this: Mr. Sanders did better in the early exit polls than he did in the final result. Therefore, Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  probably stole the \uc2 election\uc2 . The exit polls are a sufficient basis to make this determination, in the eyes of the conspiracists, because exit polls are used internationally to detect fraud. They're supposedly very accurate and ''well controlled'' (where this phrase comes from, I don't know). Furthermore, they say, the exit polls were right on the G.O.P. side -- confirming the underlying validity of the methodology and raising suspicions about the Democratic vote count.\par \par \uc2 All of this starts with a basic misconception: that the exit polls are usually pretty good.\par \par \uc2 I have no idea where this idea comes from, because everyone who knows anything about early exit polls knows that they're not great.\par \par \uc2 We can start in 2008, when the exit polls showed a pretty similar bias toward Barack Obama. Or in 2004, when the exit polls showed John Kerry easily winning an \uc2 election\uc2  he clearly lost -- with both a huge error and systematic bias outside of the ''margin of error.'' The national exits showed Kerry ahead by three points (and keep in mind the sample size on the national exit is vastly larger than for a state primary exit poll) and leading in states like Virginia, Ohio and Florida -- which all went to George W. Bush.\par \par \uc2 The story was similar in 2000. The early exit polls showed Al Gore winning Alabama, Arizona, Colorado and North Carolina. Mr. Bush won these states by between six and 15 points. The exit polls showed Mr. Gore winning Florida by six points -- leading the networks to call the race before 8 p.m. in the East.\par \par \uc2 The same thing happened in 1996. It was actually even worse in 1992. The exit polls had Bill \uc2 Clinton\uc2  winning Texas, which went to George H.W. Bush, and basically everywhere.\par \par \uc2 Now, how can this happen? There are a lot of sources for exit poll error -- even more than in an ordinary poll. Here are a few:\par \par \uc2 \u226\'00\'E2\u8211\'20\'13\u160\'00\'A0 Differential nonresponse, in which the supporters of one candidate are likelier to participate than those of another candidate. Exit polls have limited means to correct for nonresponse, since they can weight only by visually identifiable characteristics. Hispanic origin, income and education, for instance, are left out.\par \par \uc2 \u226\'00\'E2\u8211\'20\'13\u160\'00\'A0 Cluster effects, which happen when the precincts selected aren't representative of the overall population. This is a very big danger in state exit polls, which include only a small number of precincts. As a result, exit polls have a larger margin of error than an ordinary poll of similar size. These precincts are selected to have the right balance of Democratic and Republican precincts, which isn't so helpful in a primary.\par \par \uc2 \u226\'00\'E2\u8211\'20\'13\u160\'00\'A0 Absentee voters aren't included at all in states where they represent less than 20 percent or so of the vote.\par \par \uc2 For all these reasons, exit polls can be very inaccurate and systematically biased. With this kind of history, you can see why no one who studies the exit polls believes that they can be used as an indicator of fraud in the way the conspiracy theorists do.\par \par \uc2 But why were exit polls so tilted toward Mr. Sanders? It's impossible to be 100 percent sure, but the best-known bias in the exit poll offers a very good explanation: young voters.\par \par \uc2 Young voters are far likelier to complete the exit polls than older voters, according to data from \uc2 Edison Research\uc2 , the organization that conducts the exit polls. The gap is particularly pronounced when the interviewers are also younger, but the gap persists even when older interviewers are conducting the exit interviews.\par \par \uc2 The exit polls try to correct for this bias by giving more weight to older respondents. The way it works is pretty novel: Interviewers guess the age of voters as they leave the polling place. Then the responses are weighted to match the age of all the voters who showed up, based on the guesses of the interviewer.\par \par \uc2 This could work, in theory. In practice, it falls short. There's a persistent, decades-long bias toward young voters in the exit polls -- even in the final, ''adjusted'' data -- when compared with census or voter file data.\par \par \uc2 You can see that in data from the 2012 presidential \uc2 election\uc2 , which I wrote about a few weeks ago. Over all, the exit polls showed that 19 percent of voters were ages 18 to 29, compared with around 15 percent in census and voter file data. Notably, the census is an extremely high-quality survey -- so you can just pack away any theory that \uc2 election\uc2  administrators are tossing the votes of young voters in basically every jurisdiction across the country.\par \par \uc2 Why does this bias exist, despite the exit poll effort to adjust for nonresponse by age? It's hard to say; if the exit polls had the data to identify the cause, they presumably could fix it. There are at least a few possibilities -- like biased guesses, trimming weights (where they're not weighting older voters enough), or the absence of old absentee voters in some states -- but there's no way to be really sure.\par \par \uc2 What's clear is that this bias persisted in the 2016 Democratic primary. Voter registration files are just starting to be updated, and they all show that Democratic primary voters were far older than the exit polls suggested.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Sanders, of course, is a candidate with historic strength among young voters -- so it should be no surprise that the exit polls were particularly biased in his direction. Nor should it be a surprise that the exit polls were also biased toward Mr. Obama in 2008, or Democrats in many recent elections.\par \par \uc2 I'd also note that the age bias of the exit polls wouldn't have much of an effect on the Republican results: There are far fewer young voters in the Republican primary, and there wasn't much of a split between older and younger Republicans.\par \par \uc2 There are other challenges with exit polls in the primaries. Usually, the exit polls select precincts by partisanship -- ensuring a good balance of Democratic and Republican precincts. This helps in a general \uc2 election\uc2 . It doesn't do as much good in a primary.\par \par \uc2 If you're looking for the exit polls to identify fraud in the United States, you're out of luck. They would need to be redesigned: sampling many more precincts, calling more early voters and taking steps to boost response rates -- like short questionnaires, rather than the long ones used in the United States. That's not going to happen. The news media uses exit polls to get a sense of ''why'' voters did what they did, not to validate the \uc2 election\uc2  results. It's not going to spend millions more dollars to increase the accuracy of early exit polls.\par \par \uc2 What should be telling, though, is that the news media organizations that commission the exit polls, and \uc2 Edison Research\uc2 , which conducts them, do not believe that their own data is good enough to call the Democratic primary results into question.\par \par \uc2 The Upshot provides news, analysis and graphics about politics, policy and everyday life.

\par\par \uc2 National Desk; SECTA\par \b \uc2 Justices Overturn Texas Abortion Limits\b0\par\par\uc2 By ADAM LIPTAK; Julie Hirschfeld Davis and Alan Rappeport contributed reporting from Washington, and Manny Fernandez from Houston. \par \uc2 1,543 \uc2 words\par \uc2 28 June 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 1\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 WASHINGTON -- The Supreme Court on Monday reaffirmed and strengthened constitutional protections for abortion rights, striking down parts of a restrictive Texas law that could have drastically reduced the number of abortion clinics in the state, leaving them only in the largest metropolitan areas.\par \par \uc2 The 5-to-3 decision was the court's most sweeping statement on abortion since \uc2 Planned Parenthood\uc2  v. Casey in 1992, which reaffirmed the constitutional right to abortion established in 1973 in Roe v. Wade. It found that Texas' restrictions -- requiring doctors to have admitting privileges at nearby hospitals and clinics to meet the standards of ambulatory surgical centers -- violated Casey's prohibition on placing an ''undue burden'' on the ability to obtain an abortion.\par \par \uc2 If Casey limited the right established in Roe, allowing states to regulate abortion in ways Roe had barred, Monday's decision effectively expanded that right. It means that similar requirements in other states are most likely also unconstitutional, and it imperils many other kinds of restrictions on abortion. It is also sure to energize anti-abortion forces and make abortion a central issue in the presidential campaign.\par \par \uc2 The decision concerned two parts of a law that imposed strict requirements on abortion providers in Texas signed into law in July 2013 by Rick Perry, the governor at the time.\par \par \uc2 One required all clinics in the state to meet the standards for ambulatory surgical centers, including regulations concerning buildings, equipment and staffing. The other required doctors performing abortions to have admitting privileges at a nearby hospital.\par \par \uc2 ''We conclude,'' Justice Stephen G. Breyer wrote for the majority, ''that neither of these provisions offers medical benefits sufficient to justify the burdens upon access that each imposes. Each places a substantial obstacle in the path of women seeking a previability abortion, each constitutes an undue burden on abortion access, and each violates the federal Constitution.''\par \par \uc2 Justices \uc2 Anthony M. Kennedy\uc2 , \uc2 Ruth Bader Ginsburg\uc2 , \uc2 Sonia Sotomayor\uc2  and \uc2 Elena Kagan\uc2  joined the majority opinion. Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. and Justices \uc2 Clarence Thomas\uc2  and Samuel A. Alito Jr. dissented.\par \par \uc2 Justice Kennedy's vote was the crucial one, and it came as a relief to abortion rights groups, which have long viewed his thinking on the issue as a contradictory muddle.\par \par \uc2 In the Casey decision, he joined Justices Sandra Day O'Connor and David H. Souter in a joint opinion that reaffirmed the core of Roe v. Wade. But Justice Kennedy's reputation as an abortion rights champion had otherwise been undeserved, said David S. Cohen, a law professor at Drexel University, as Casey was the only case in which he had found an abortion restriction unconstitutional in his 28 years on the Supreme Court.\par \par \uc2 Professor Cohen said Justice Kennedy's vote in Monday's case was a puzzle. He may have been swayed by the burdens placed on women having to drive hundreds of miles to obtain abortions, Professor Cohen said, or by the lack of medical evidence justifying the restrictions -- or both.\par \par \uc2 Many states have enacted restrictions in recent years that test the limits of the constitutional right to abortion, and the ruling in the new case, Whole Woman's Health v. Hellerstedt, No. 15-274, enunciated principles that will apply to all of the ones said to be justified by a concern for women's health.\par \par \uc2 In a message posted on Twitter, President Obama said he was ''pleased to see the Supreme Court reaffirm'' that ''every woman has a constitutional right to make her own reproductive choices.''\par \par \uc2 Ken Paxton, Texas' attorney general, said, ''The court is becoming a default medical board for the nation, with no deference being given to state law.''\par \par \uc2 The Texas law was passed in 2013 by the Republican-dominated Texas Legislature and turned a Democratic state senator, Wendy Davis, who conducted an 11-hour filibuster against the law, into a national political star.\par \par \uc2 Last June, the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, in New Orleans, largely upheld the contested provisions of the Texas law, saying it had to accept lawmakers' assertions about the health benefits of abortion restrictions. The appeals court ruled that the law, with minor exceptions, did not place an undue burden on the right to abortion.\par \par \uc2 Justice Breyer said the appeals court's approach was at odds with the proper application of the undue-burden standard. The Casey decision, he said, ''requires that courts consider the burdens a law imposes on abortion access together with the benefits those laws confer.''\par \par \uc2 In dissent, Justice Thomas said the majority opinion ''reimagines the undue-burden standard,'' creating a ''benefits-and-burdens balancing test.'' He said courts should resolve conflicting positions by deferring to legislatures.\par \par \uc2 ''Today's opinion,'' Justice Thomas wrote, ''does resemble Casey in one respect: After disregarding significant aspects of the court's prior jurisprudence, the majority applies the undue-burden standard in a way that will surely mystify lower courts for years to come.''\par \par \uc2 The majority opinion considered whether the claimed benefits of the restrictions outweighed the burdens they placed on a constitutional right. Justice Breyer wrote that there was no evidence that the admitting-privileges requirement ''would have helped even one woman obtain better treatment.''\par \par \uc2 At the same time, he wrote, there was good evidence that the admitting-privileges requirement caused the number of abortion clinics in Texas to drop from 40 to 20.\par \par \uc2 In a second dissent, Justice Alito, joined by Chief Justice Roberts and Justice Thomas, said the causal link between the law and the closings was unproven. Withdrawal of state funds, a decline in the demand for abortions and doctors' retirements may have played a role, Justice Alito wrote.\par \par \uc2 Justice Breyer wrote that the requirement that abortion clinics meet the demanding and elaborate standards for ambulatory surgical centers also did more harm than good.\par \par \uc2 ''Abortions taking place in an abortion facility are safe -- indeed, safer than numerous procedures that take place outside hospitals and to which Texas does not apply its surgical-center requirements,'' he wrote, reviewing the evidence. ''Nationwide, childbirth is 14 times more likely than abortion to result in death, but Texas law allows a midwife to oversee childbirth in the patient's own home.''\par \par \uc2 In dissent, Justice Alito said there was good reason to think that the restrictions were meant to protect women. ''The law was one of many enacted by states in the wake of the Kermit Gosnell scandal, in which a physician who ran an abortion clinic in Philadelphia was convicted for the first degree murder of three infants who were born alive and for the manslaughter of a patient,'' he wrote.\par \par \uc2 Justice Breyer acknowledged that ''Gosnell's behavior was terribly wrong.''\par \par \uc2 ''But,'' he added, ''there is no reason to believe that an extra layer of regulation would have affected that behavior.''\par \par \uc2 The clinics challenging the law said it had already caused about half the state's 41 abortion clinics to close. If the contested provisions had taken full effect, they said, the number of clinics would again be cut in half.\par \par \uc2 The Supreme Court's decision rippled through the presidential campaign, with Democrats and Republicans looking to rally voters with reminders that the future of the court is at stake.\par \par \uc2 The next president will have at least one and potentially several vacancies to fill, and \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  and \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2  have both warned that the fate of laws on immigration, guns and abortion will most likely be determined by who gets to fill those openings.\par \par \uc2 Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , the presumptive Democratic nominee, seized on the court's ruling to warn that Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , her Republican opponent, poses a threat to women. She recalled his suggestion this year that abortion should be banned and that women who violate that ban should be penalized. She also said that with other states also seeking to restrict access to abortions and with Republicans seeking to defund \uc2 Planned Parenthood\uc2 , proponents of abortions rights could not afford to let up.\par \par \uc2 ''We've seen a concerted, persistent attack on women's health and rights at the federal level,'' Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  said in a statement. ''Meanwhile, Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  has said women should be punished for having abortions.''\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  has since retracted his assertion that women should be punished for having abortions, but the re-emergence of the issue is likely to put him on the defensive because of his previous support of abortion rights.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  made no direct public comments on Monday's decision.\par \par \uc2 Still, for many Republicans, the decision added urgency to their desire to keep Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  from winning the presidency.\par \par \uc2 ''Today's disappointing decision is another reminder of what's at stake in this \uc2 election\uc2  and why we can't afford to let \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  win,'' Reince Priebus, the chairman of the Republican National Committee, said.\par \par \uc2 Follow The \uc2 New York Times\uc2 's politics and Washington coverage on \uc2 Facebook\uc2  and Twitter, and sign up for the First Draft politics newsletter.\par \par \uc2 Follow \uc2 Adam Liptak\uc2  on Twitter @adamliptak.\par \par \uc2 Demonstrators gathered outside the Supreme Court in Washington on Monday. The decision was the court's most sweeping statement on abortion since 1992.

\par\par \uc2 Politics; SECT\par \b \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  Hires Former Adviser to Ted Cruz\b0\par\par\uc2 By MAGGIE HABERMAN \par \uc2 447 \uc2 words\par \uc2 28 June 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 The New York Times on the Web\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2  has hired a veteran political strategist and former adviser to Senator Ted Cruz as his de facto communications director, a significant move as Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  shifts toward a more traditional campaign structure.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, has brought on Jason Miller, of Jamestown Associates, to oversee his campaign's interactions with the news media, according to a news release from the campaign. Until now those interactions have been done through a lone spokeswoman.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Miller's hire was first reported by Bloomberg Politics. It signals a new phase of Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's campaign, after a major shake-up that included the ouster of his campaign manager, \uc2 Corey Lewandowski\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 An aide to Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  did not respond immediately to a request for comment. But the people briefed on the hiring said it was the first in a series of coming changes to beef up the team.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Miller worked for the presidential campaign of Mr. Cruz, the last-standing potentially serious challenger to Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  in the primaries. Mr. Cruz withdrew from the race after losing the Indiana primary on May 3. Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's description of Mr. Cruz as ''Lyin' Ted'' helped sink his candidacy.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Miller is a veteran of a number of campaigns, including \uc2 Rudolph W. Giuliani\uc2 's presidential effort in 2008. He has a deep reservoir of relationships with national reporters.\par \par \uc2 His firm, Jamestown Associates, used to employ Ken Kurson, the editor of The New York Observer, which is owned by Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's son-in-law, \uc2 Jared Kushner\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 The firm earned notoriety in the 2014 midterm elections when it was banned from work by the \uc2 National Republican Senatorial Committee\uc2  because it represented insurgent challengers to Republican senators in primaries. That outsider approach dovetails with Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's own message in the presidential race.\par \par \uc2 When in 2011 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  considered running for president, one of his advisers put together a theoretical plan for a campaign that included Mr. Miller as the campaign manager. In that race, the person imagined as the New Hampshire state director was Mr. Lewandowski.\par \par \uc2 The campaign is also adding Michael Abboud as a communications coordinator, helping with a newly formed rapid response operation. And Alan Cobb, who was a close ally of Mr. Lewandowski, has been reassigned as the director of coalition groups.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  said in a news release that he was ''constantly building a superior political team'' for the fall general \uc2 election\uc2  against \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Find out what you need to know about the 2016 presidential race today, and get politics news updates via \uc2 Facebook\uc2 , \uc2 Twitter\uc2  and the First Draft newsletter.\par \par \uc2 Document NYTF000020160628ec6s0004u\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 Politics; SECT\par \b \uc2 Supreme Court's Abortion Decision Reverberates in Presidential Campaign\b0\par\par\uc2 By ALAN RAPPEPORT \par \uc2 407 \uc2 words\par \uc2 28 June 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 The New York Times on the Web\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 The Supreme Court's decision to strike down parts of a restrictive abortion law in Texas rippled through the presidential campaign after its release on Monday, with Democrats and Republicans looking to rally voters with reminders that the future of the court was at stake in November.\par \par \uc2 The next president looks to have at least one and potentially several vacancies to fill in the next four years, and \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  and \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2  have both warned that the fate of laws on immigration, guns and abortion will probably be determined by who gets to fill those openings.\par \par \uc2 Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , the presumptive Democratic nominee, seized on the court's ruling to warn that Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , her presumptive Republican opponent, poses a threat to women. She recalled his suggestion this year that abortion be banned and that women who violate that ban be penalized. She also said that with other states also seeking to restrict access to abortions and with Republicans seeking to defund \uc2 Planned Parenthood\uc2 , proponents of abortions rights could not afford to let up.\par \par \uc2 ''We've seen a concerted, persistent attack on women's health and rights at the federal level,'' Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  said in a statement. ''Meanwhile, \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  has said women should be punished for having abortions.''\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  has since retracted his assertion that women should be punished for having abortions, but the re-emergence of the issue is likely to put him on the defensive because of his previous position in support of abortion rights.\par \par \uc2 Still, the Whole Woman's Health v. Hellerstedt decision added urgency to many Republicans' desire to keep Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  from winning the presidency. Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  has used the prospect of liberal justices filling the court to compel skeptical Republicans to back him, and on Monday, the \uc2 Republican National Committee\uc2  echoed that argument.\par \par \uc2 ''The next president will likely appoint multiple justices to the Supreme Court that could determine its course for decades to come,'' said Reince Priebus, the chairman of the Republican National Committee. ''We must always fight to protect life, and today's disappointing decision is another reminder of what's at stake in this \uc2 election\uc2  and why we can't afford to let \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  win.''\par \par \uc2 Find out what you need to know about the 2016 presidential race today, and get politics news updates via \uc2 Facebook\uc2 , \uc2 Twitter\uc2  and the First Draft newsletter.\par \par \uc2 Document NYTF000020160628ec6s0004r\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw272\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4080\pichgoal600

\par\par \b \uc2 Gillibrand Tests Her Clout --- Senator backs several first-time candidates for Congress, even if they aren't party's pick\b0\par\par\uc2 By Mike Vilensky  \par \uc2 870 \uc2 words\par \uc2 27 June 2016\par \uc2 The Wall Street Journal\par \uc2 J\par A15\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.  \par \par \uc2 Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand has dived into New York's Democratic primaries, endorsing, funding and advising several first-time congressional candidates in a test of the junior senator's own star power.\par \par \uc2 In Syracuse, Ms. Gillibrand is campaigning for Colleen Deacon, 39 years old, who was a waitress on food stamps before entering politics and worked for six years as the senator's regional aide. Ms. Gillibrand is also backing Zephyr Teachout, the law professor who challenged \uc2 Gov. Andrew Cuomo\uc2  two years ago, in a Hudson Valley primary.\par \par \uc2 In Harlem, in a crowded Democratic primary to succeed retiring Rep. Charlie Rangel, Ms. Gillibrand is backing veteran state legislator Keith Wright. In the race for retiring Republican Rep. Richard Hanna's Broome County seat, Ms. Gillibrand helped recruit businesswoman Kim Myers. A Gillibrand-founded political action committee donated $10,000 to Ms. Myers's congressional campaign.\par \par \uc2 On Long Island, Ms. Gillibrand campaigned for Anna Throne-Holst, the former Southampton town supervisor running against former federal prosecutor Dave Calone. "I'm looking to be her mini-me in Congress," Ms. Throne-Holst said.\par \par \uc2 Depending on the outcome of the primaries on Tuesday and the general \uc2 election\uc2  in November, Ms. Gillibrand, 49 years old, could find herself with a handful of new allies or adversaries.\par \par \uc2 Her efforts are rooted in a campaign she began five years ago called Off the Sidelines to fund and advise female candidates. "We're encouraging women to run, even when there are primaries," she said during an interview, "and supporting them when they get in, even if they're not the party's choice."\par \par \uc2 In past years, she supported Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii and Rep. Terri Sewell of Alabama, then both first-time congressional candidates, in their primaries.\par \par \uc2 Her more recent efforts to sway New York's House delegation show a confidence in her statewide appeal, boosted by her support for relatively nonpartisan issues like combating sexual assault in the military, analysts said.\par \par \uc2 In a January poll conducted by Siena College, nearly two-thirds of New York Democrats had a favorable opinion of Ms. Gillibrand. Upstate, "her numbers are as good as ever for a Democrat," said Steven Greenberg, a Siena pollster.\par \par \uc2 She isn't the only senator assisting first-time candidates. Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont has blessed and raised funds for several others. One of them, Eric Kingson, 70, is running against Ms. Deacon, Ms. Gillibrand's pick for the upstate New York race.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Kingson, a Syracuse University professor, is part of the group that Mr. Sanders's supporters call "Bernie's Army."\par \par \uc2 Ms. Gillibrand doesn't have a nickname for her own cadre. "I don't see the candidates that way," she said.\par \par \uc2 Ms. Deacon, who, like Ms. Gillibrand, is a \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  supporter, said she decided to run for office after Ms. Gillibrand suggested it.\par \par \uc2 "I said, really?" Ms. Deacon said. "Then I thought, why not?"\par \par \uc2 Mr. Kingson criticized Ms. Gillibrand's endorsement of Ms. Deacon as "playing an old, insider's Washington game."\par \par \uc2 He and Ms. Deacon are also vying with Syracuse attorney \uc2 Steve Williams\uc2 . The winner will face incumbent Republican Rep. John Katko.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Calone, running on Long Island against Ms. Throne-Holst, said his endorsements from local Suffolk County politicians are more meaningful than a stamp of approval from a U.S. senator.\par \par \uc2 A Gillibrand-founded political action committee also donated this year to the campaigns for Democratic congressional candidates Mike Derrick and John Plumb, both seeking to unseat Republican incumbents in upstate New York.\par \par \uc2 Ms. Gillibrand sent out a fundraising appeal for Ms. Teachout, who has outraised her Democratic primary opponent, and the Teachout campaign sent out mailers touting the endorsement.\par \par \uc2 It remains to be seen how Ms. Gillibrand's endorsement could affect candidates in November's general \uc2 election\uc2 , particularly upstate, where there is still tension over her support for stronger gun-control laws.\par \par \uc2 Republican congressional candidate Andrew Heaney, who, like Ms. Teachout, is running for the seat to be vacated by Rep. Chris Gibson, said the senator "promised to protect our Second Amendment rights and betrayed that promise," and constituents haven't forgotten it.\par \par \uc2 Ms. Gillibrand has said she changed her feelings on gun rights after learning more about the issue and meeting with gun-violence victims.\par \par \uc2 Charles Schumer\uc2 , New York's senior senator, is expected to become leader of the Senate Democrats next year, and political observers speculated Ms. Gillibrand's statewide profile could rise as he becomes more involved in national issues. In that case, they say, she could benefit from indebted, newly elected lawmakers.\par \par \uc2 Ms. Gillibrand disagreed, saying Mr. Schumer would have "greater responsibilities to the whole country, but I don't think he'll miss a beat in New York." She said her work pushing candidates stems from wanting to "pay it forward" after Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  helped her get into politics.\par \par \uc2 Ms. Gillibrand's name has also been floated as a potential gubernatorial candidate. Asked if she is eyeing the governor's job, she said she is "honored to serve in the Senate."\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=wjco20160627000100"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document J000000020160627ec6r0002e\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 CORRECTION APPENDEDPHOENIX -- Karina Ruiz and other protesters blocked a busy road here last week hours after the Supreme Court denied relief from deportation for millions of undocumented parents, including her father.\par \par \uc2 ''No papers, no fear!'' she chanted, pumping her fists in the air.\par \par \uc2 But with a small army of police officers assembled nearby, ready to make arrests, there was ample fear amid the bravado.\par \par \uc2 Whether to speak out or stay hidden has long been a quandary for the millions of undocumented immigrants in the United States. The court's decision on Thursday is amplifying that angst as immigrants wonder how aggressively they can push for change, or just lead normal lives, when one wrong move could mean a one-way trip to the country they left.\par \par \uc2 ''It's hard for the community,'' Eliana Fernandez said. ''They were thinking their life was going to be different, they could come out of the shadows, but now it's like, 'Sorry.'''\par \par \uc2 Ms. Fernandez, 28, is an immigrant from Ecuador and a case manager for \uc2 Make the Road New York\uc2 , an advocacy group. On Friday, she attended a protest in Lower Manhattan against the deadlocked court's ruling.\par \par \uc2 ''When you have a lot at stake,'' Ms. Fernandez said, ''it takes a lot of guts to go out and say, 'I'm undocumented.'''\par \par \uc2 For younger immigrants, who grew up as states like Arizona were enacting hard-edge policies to crack down on illegal immigration, visibility remains the best strategy. They say that stepping out of the shadows and speaking publicly is a way to humanize their plight and counter the arguments that they are dangerous or a drain on the United States.\par \par \uc2 It was the strategy that activists used four years ago to persuade the Obama administration to allow young people without documents to live and work legally in the country if they met certain age restrictions and had lived continuously in the United States for at least five years when the program took effect.\par \par \uc2 ''I can't sit in silence,'' said Ms. Ruiz, 31, who is the president of the Arizona Dream Act Coalition, a group that campaigns for immigrants' rights and education, and the mother of three children born in the United States.\par \par \uc2 ''Politicians don't have our backs, so I have to fight,'' she said. ''This is my life.''\par \par \uc2 For other immigrants, Thursday's ruling was a stark reminder of the fragility of their situation. The Obama administration would have protected from deportation at least four million parents who are undocumented but whose children are legal residents or American citizens. Now, even though President \uc2 Obama\uc2  made clear after the court's decision that deporting these parents would not be a priority, fear lingers and a presidential campaign looms.\par \par \uc2 Melissa Montano, 29, has been working for immigrants' rights since she was in high school in Los Angeles. She asked to be identified by her middle name out of fear of attracting attention, and said the immigration authorities had retaliated by starting deportation proceedings against some outspoken activists.\par \par \uc2 Ms. Montano and her mother have openly acknowledged their lack of legal status since 2010, the year Arizona passed a law giving the police broad powers to stop anyone they suspected of being in the country illegally. The measure changed the course of the nation's immigration debate as many states followed suit with similarly tough laws.\par \par \uc2 Ms. Montano said they did not feel completely safe. ''This is an everyday struggle for us,'' she said.\par \par \uc2 Ms. Fernandez immigrated from Ecuador at 14, and received relief from deportation because she arrived so young. She and her husband, who is undocumented, have two American-born children. Because of the court's deadlock, he is vulnerable to deportation.\par \par \uc2 Many of the people who blocked the street in Phoenix spent Friday morning at a vigil outside the county jail where four protesters were detained for refusing orders to disperse. The protesters were eventually released.\par \par \uc2 Ms. Ruiz visited her father on Thursday night. He does not have documents, and she wanted to apologize for giving him hope that he would be able to remain here legally.\par \par \uc2 ''I'm trying to cheer him up,'' Ms. Ruiz said. ''It's hard.''\par \par \uc2 Hector Romero, 25, said that he had been able to suppress his anxiety even though his mother was deported to Mexico, but that his sisters got nervous each time their father drove more than a few hours from his home in Los Angeles. Their father, a carwash worker who has no immigration papers, keeps his head down to avoid being caught, Mr. Romero said.\par \par \uc2 ''To be undocumented,'' he said, ''means always being in fear and walking a thin line.''\par \par \uc2 On Friday, Mr. Romero and his father were at work at the carwash, carrying on as they always had.\par \par \uc2 Unbowed by the defeat, Ms. Ruiz directed a group of high school students who had volunteered to knock on doors across Latino enclaves in Phoenix to register eligible voters. The November elections are particularly meaningful, she said.\par \par \uc2 After all, \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, has vowed to build a wall along the border with Mexico and deport 11 million unauthorized immigrants across the United States.\par \par \uc2 Also on the ballot in Arizona is Sheriff Joe Arpaio of Maricopa County, who is known for his tough talk on illegal immigration as well as his workplace raids and neighborhood roundups of illegal immigrants\par \par \uc2 ''To a lot of Latinos, this \uc2 election\uc2  is personal,'' Ms. Ruiz said.\par \par \uc2 For Abril Gallardo, 25, an organizer for Living United for Change in Arizona, an advocacy group in Phoenix, the fight is for a moratorium on deportations until Congress agrees on a plan for a wholesale rewriting of the immigration laws.\par \par \uc2 ''Keep our families together,'' she said. ''That's the main priority.''\par \par \uc2 For Angel Olvera of Pasadena, Calif., an organizer with the National Day Laborer Organizing Network, it is about teaching his two American-born children to make the right choices.\par \par \uc2 ''The government denied us a right to fight for what we want, but we are just going to keep fighting,'' said Mr. Olvera, an undocumented immigrant from Mexico.\par \par \uc2 ''I came to this country because I know my kids are going to have a better chance. But now I am going to be struggling just as I have always done so that they can one day vote for the right candidates, the ones that will do something for our community.''\par \par \uc2 Isabel Medina, 49, came to the United States from Michoac\u225\'00\'E1n State in Mexico for the same reason. She has worked as a house cleaner, factory worker and medical assistant in the two decades she has lived in East Los Angeles. After her 21-year-old son gained the right to live and work in the United States under an Obama administration program for certain young immigrants, Ms. Medina began volunteering more in politics. Now, she works with the Coalition for Human Immigrant Rights of Los Angeles, trying to urge elected officials to pass comprehensive immigration reform.\par \par \uc2 Ms. Medina said she would probably stop traveling between states and to parts of the country that are less welcoming to immigrants than California, now that the Supreme Court decision has reawakened long-forgotten fears.\par \par \uc2 ''I am devastated,'' she said, ''but I am not defeated.''\par \par \uc2 Correction: June 28, 2016, Tuesday\par \par \uc2 This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: Because of an editing error, an article on Monday about the reaction of undocumented immigrants to the recent Supreme Court ruling on President \uc2 Obama\uc2 's immigration policies, misstated the requirements for young immigrants to live and work legally in the United States under a policy established by the president in 2012. They had to meet certain age requirements and had to have lived in the country for at least five years when the program took effect; they did not need to have graduated from college or completed two years of military service.\par \par \uc2 A roadblock on Thursday in Phoenix to protest a Supreme Court decision that exposed as many as five million unauthorized immigrants to deportation.; Karina Ruiz, 31, is an activist whose father is undocumented and vulnerable to deportation.

\par\par \uc2 Metropolitan Desk; SECTA\par \b \uc2 Congressional Hopefuls Face Off in Primaries; Power Balance Could Shift\b0\par\par\uc2 By WILLIAM NEUMAN \par \uc2 1,123 \uc2 words\par \uc2 27 June 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 17\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Come November, the New York State congressional delegation is certain to look different, with several incumbents retiring, and those remaining forced to deal with the effect of \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, on the ballot.\par \par \uc2 But before the general \uc2 election\uc2 , primary voters will first choose congressional candidates on Tuesday, in districts around the state that could ultimately help shape the balance of power in the House of Representatives.\par \par \uc2 ''These House races will be very significant if the Democrats nationally are going to make any kind of major dent in the Republican majority,'' said Bruce Gyory, a Democratic political consultant who is not working on any of the primary races.\par \par \uc2 Republicans hold a commanding advantage in the House, and while it appears unlikely that their party could lose its majority, many experts predict that Democrats could narrow the margin considerably -- especially if there is a backlash against Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 The marquee matchup in New York in November could be in the 19th Congressional District in the Hudson Valley and the Catskills, where Representative Chris Gibson, a Republican, is retiring after three terms. Mr. Gibson is following what he has referred to as a self-imposed term limit, and strong candidates from each party -- both former hopefuls for governor -- appear poised to win the primaries.\par \par \uc2 On the Republican side, the leading candidate is John Faso, a former state assemblyman who twice ran unsuccessfully for statewide office, including a 2006 bid for governor against Eliot Spitzer. He is running against Andrew Heaney, a businessman.\par \par \uc2 Zephyr Teachout is running in the Democratic primary. Ms. Teachout went from a virtual unknown to an unexpected political sensation in 2014, when she mounted a surprisingly strong primary challenge to \uc2 Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Her opponent in the 19th District primary is Will Yandik, a farmer and environmentalist.\par \par \uc2 A recent Siena College poll showed Mr. Faso and Ms. Teachout with large leads.\par \par \uc2 ''This has the makeup of a really interesting four-month battle to November,'' Steven Greenberg, of the Siena College Research Institute, said.\par \par \uc2 ''That's going to be a battle royale,'' said Bill Lipton, the New York State director of the Working Families Party, which has endorsed Ms. Teachout.\par \par \uc2 Another retiring incumbent is in the Third District, on Long Island, where Representative Steve Israel, a Democrat, will be leaving Congress after 16 years. Mr. Israel is a former chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee.\par \par \uc2 In the Democratic primary to replace Mr. Israel, the most prominent candidate is Tom Suozzi, the former Nassau County executive. He has four opponents. They include Anna Kaplan, an Iranian Jewish immigrant and member of the North Hempstead Town Board who has received the endorsement of the state chapter of the \uc2 National Organization for Women\uc2 ; and Steve Stern, a Suffolk County legislator who was endorsed by Mr. Israel.\par \par \uc2 The district includes parts of Suffolk, Nassau and Queens Counties. Mr. Stern has a potential advantage because he is based in Suffolk County, while the other candidates are from Nassau and could split the vote among their base. Mr. Suozzi has the endorsement of Melinda Katz, the Queens borough president, and could benefit from a strong get-out-the-vote effort there.\par \par \uc2 The Republican candidate for the fall \uc2 election\uc2  is State Senator Jack M. Martins.\par \par \uc2 Lawrence Levy, the executive dean of the National Center for Suburban Studies at \uc2 Hofstra University\uc2 , said the district was normally considered safe for the Democrats but that Mr. Martins posed a threat because he had shown an ability to appeal to moderate Democrats.\par \par \uc2 ''By enrollment and congressional voting patterns, it's solidly Democratic and it would take a Republican with incredible crossover skills to be able to win that,'' Mr. Levy said. ''Martins is about the closest thing that the Republicans have to that.''\par \par \uc2 In central New York, Richard Hanna, a three-term Republican, chose not to seek re-\uc2 election\uc2  in the 22nd District.\par \par \uc2 Several Republicans are facing off in the primary there, including Claudia Tenney, a state assemblywoman with Tea Party support who staged a strong primary challenge from the right against Mr. Hanna two years ago.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Gyory, the consultant, said Democrats hoped that if Ms. Tenney won the primary, their candidate, Kim Myers, a Binghamton, N.Y., businesswoman who does not face a primary challenger, would have a chance to carry the district by capturing moderate Republican votes.\par \par \uc2 Another race where the incumbent is retiring is in the 13th District in Upper Manhattan and the Bronx, represented by Charles B. Rangel, who was first elected to Congress in 1970. Nine Democrats are in a tight battle in the primary there, but the area is so heavily Democratic that the winner is almost assured victory in the fall.\par \par \uc2 There are at least two districts with battles among Democrats seeking to challenge Republican incumbents who could be vulnerable in November.\par \par \uc2 In the 24th District, which includes Syracuse, three Democrats are fighting for the chance to face Representative John Katko, a Republican. The district has flip-flopped repeatedly between the two parties.\par \par \uc2 On the Democratic side, Bernie Sanders, the presidential hopeful and senator from Vermont, has endorsed Eric Kingson, an expert on Social Security. He is running against Colleen Deacon, a former aide to Senator Kirsten E. Gillibrand, and \uc2 Steve Williams\uc2 , a local lawyer. It was not clear how influential Mr. Sanders's endorsement would be.\par \par \uc2 On Long Island, Lee Zeldin, the Republican incumbent in the First District, has emerged as a strong supporter of Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 . He gained national attention recently when he defended the presidential hopeful's attack on a judge in a lawsuit involving \uc2 Trump\uc2  University; Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  had said the judge was biased because he was Mexican, even though he was born in the United States.\par \par \uc2 In defending Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , Mr. Zeldin suggested that President Obama could be considered a racist because of some of his policies and statements.\par \par \uc2 The Democratic primary candidates in the district are Anna Throne-Holst, a former Southampton town supervisor, and Dave Calone, a venture capitalist and a former federal prosecutor.\par \par \uc2 ''Zeldin is going to test the \uc2 Trump\uc2  effect on down ballot races,'' Mr. Levy, of the National Center for Suburban Studies, said. ''Suffolk is a little more conservative, thus a little more fertile for \uc2 Trump\uc2 . Will support for him help Zeldin? At the time that he went all in, I imagine that he thought so. If \uc2 Trump\uc2 's numbers keep falling, it could turn out to be a bad bet.''\par \par \uc2 Zephyr Teachout, a Democrat, is a candidate for Congress in the 19th District. John Faso is the leading Republican candidate.

\par\par \uc2 THE INTERPRETER\par \uc2 Foreign Desk; SECT\par \b \uc2 A Lesson From 'Brexit': On Immigration, Feelings \uc2 Trump\uc2  Facts\b0\par\par\uc2 By AMANDA TAUB \par \uc2 1,452 \uc2 words\par \uc2 27 June 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 The New York Times on the Web\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 CORRECTION APPENDEDWASHINGTON -- The economic fallout from Britain's vote to leave the \uc2 European Union\uc2  was swift and stark. The pound cratered to its lowest level in three decades. When the \uc2 London Stock Exchange\uc2  opened the next morning, its leading share index immediately fell by more than 8 percent, the largest single-day drop since the 2008 financial crisis.\par \par \uc2 This was pretty much what financial analysts had predicted. And it is clear from polling data and interviews with voters that those who voted for ''Brexit'' had been well warned about the economic risks. They just cared more about something else: immigration.\par \par \uc2 Most research has found that immigration has bolstered the British economy. But voters supporting the Leave campaign either were unpersuaded by the evidence, did not think it had benefited them or felt the downsides outweighed the upsides.\par \par \uc2 Brexit is not just a blow to the British economy, but also strikes at a core assumption behind the modern liberal order: that voters will act in their self-interest.\par \par \uc2 The progress of the last 50 years, particularly in Europe, has made it easy to buy into the idea that the forces of nationalism, xenophobia and prejudice are mere irrationalities, market distortions that will naturally fade away in the long arc of history.\par \par \uc2 Last week's vote highlighted -- not for the first time, but with unusual clarity -- the hole in that theory. For many people, identity trumps economics. They will pay a high price (literally, in this case) to preserve a social order that makes them feel safe and powerful.\par \par \uc2 That dynamic is not limited to Britain, or to this referendum. It is playing out in democracies around the world, and immigration has become its focal point.\par \par \uc2 Many citizens, particularly those who have suffered under the economic pressures of globalization, express their anxiety over these changes by focusing on another form of change: foreigners in their midst. Halting immigration, even if the actual effect is to worsen their own economic situation, seems like a way of staving off those larger changes.\par \par \uc2 Democratic governments have shown over and over that they have no answer for this anxiety, even as the stakes, in Europe and globally, continue mounting.\par \par \uc2 Facts Cannot Compete With Feelings\par \par \uc2 The economist \uc2 Michael Clemens\uc2  has called immigration a ''trillion-dollar bill lying on the sidewalk'': a tremendous increase in wealth waiting to be seized by any country that is attractive to immigrants and willing to welcome them. Loosening restrictions on global labor flows, he argues, would offer a bigger boost to global economies than would dropping all restrictions on trade and capital.\par \par \uc2 But evidence does not vote -- people do. And it turns out that the gains of immigration often feel elusive, whereas the costs can be perceived as heavier than they really are.\par \par \uc2 A poll released June 20 by Ipsos/MORI showed that 47 percent of voters planning to support Brexit said immigration had been bad for Britain's economy. Never mind that a study by Britain's National Institute of Economic and Social Research found that immigration had increased the country's gross domestic product and had lowered the cost of government services like health care and pensions, which in turn helped reduce taxes.\par \par \uc2 To be sure, just because immigration is a net positive for the country as a whole does not mean that it benefits all of its people. The geographic breakdown of Thursday's vote showed that the regions where the Leave campaign fared the best were areas that tend to have few immigrants but also lower wages, according to analysis conducted by Torsten Bell, the director of the Resolution Foundation, a British think tank.\par \par \uc2 This suggests that economic anxiety might be expressed as anti-immigration sentiment even by Britons who have not lost jobs to foreigners.\par \par \uc2 ''You tend to see anti-immigrant sentiment in areas hit by changing economic circumstances or global crises,'' said Alexandra Cirone, a fellow at the \uc2 London School of Economics\uc2 . ''Framing this globalization problem as immigration can also tug on the heartstrings of potential voters, regardless of the actual facts.''\par \par \uc2 How Economic Pressures and Demographic Change Blur\par \par \uc2 So why do people take their economic anxiety out on faceless foreigners? The right answer is probably the simplest one: Immigrants do change their new countries in a million tiny but noticeable ways, even if taking local jobs may not be one of them. Those changes can still be unsettling, even though many changes are undeniably positive.\par \par \uc2 For people who are already destabilized by economic strain, those social changes contribute to a feeling that something precious is being lost, that their country is turning away from the things they value and toward a new and unfamiliar future.\par \par \uc2 The Leave campaign spoke to those anxieties by arguing that immigration (which, it sometimes implied, would be nonwhite) had brought Britain to the ''breaking point.'' British tabloids covered crimes by asylum-seekers in lurid detail and warned that refugees were a ''swarm'' that could ''swamp'' the country.\par \par \uc2 That phenomenon is hardly limited to Britain. In the United States, net immigration from Mexico has been at zero since 2010, but Republican primary voters still cheered \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's promise to build a wall on the southern border as though it would solve whatever was worrying them.\par \par \uc2 Brian Klaas, also a fellow at the \uc2 London School of Economics\uc2 , said there were many parallels between supporters of Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  and the U.K. Independence Party, a prime backer of Brexit.\par \par \uc2 Both might be ''a working-class person who has felt completely dislocated and left behind by the global economy,'' Mr. Klaas said. ''Both feel that they have been left behind by globalization, and they have both determined that the problem is not just immigration, but also a shadowy government bureaucracy far away.''\par \par \uc2 In Australia, rising anti-immigration sentiment has focused especially on refugees from Southeast Asia, often disparaged as ''boat people.'' The country's leadership, under growing popular pressure, created a system of offshore detention centers to warehouse refugees indefinitely rather than allow them onto Australian shores. These centers have been accused of abuses including rape, assault and child sexual abuse.\par \par \uc2 When Anti-Immigrant Backlash Is Expressed at the Polls\par \par \uc2 Anti-immigrant backlash can play out in several ways. Immigrants may experience xenophobic attacks or be endangered by legal limbo. But the consequences can also be much broader.\par \par \uc2 Brexit, of course, has shown that there can be severe economic risks. But there are political risks as well. In Hungary, for instance, anti-immigrant sentiment has buoyed President \uc2 Viktor Orban\uc2 's popularity, as well as that of the far-right Jobbik party. Mr. Orban has been criticized for restrictions on press freedom and judicial independence.\par \par \uc2 In Greece, a platform of open hostility to foreigners and slogans like ''Greece belongs to the Greeks'' have made the neo-fascist Golden Dawn the third-biggest party in Parliament. The party won a half-million votes in the September \uc2 election\uc2 , even though its most prominent leaders were on trial for murder at the time.\par \par \uc2 A relatively new body of social science research portrays a group of ''authoritarians'' who are dispersed across demographics but desire conformity, order and social norms. These can be ''activated,'' as the scholars describe it, when they feel threatened by social change, and then will seek harsh, punitive policies that target outsiders and restore the status quo.\par \par \uc2 As Jonathan Haidt, a social psychologist and professor at New York University's Stern School of Business, put it: ''It's as though a button is pushed on their forehead that says, 'In case of moral threat, lock down the borders, kick out those who are different and punish those who are morally deviant.'''\par \par \uc2 Experts on this phenomenon say it helps explain the seemingly sudden support, in the United States, for Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  and his proposals for mass deportations and a ban on all Muslim immigration.\par \par \uc2 In other words, social change and economic stress -- exactly what many pro-Brexit communities have been experiencing in recent years -- often lead to a rise in anti-immigrant sentiment.\par \par \uc2 Globalization is not going away, and neither are the changes that it brings, including the rise in migration and the division of societies into economic winners and losers. The turmoil created by Brexit may itself become the source of more change, more stress, more instability.\par \par \uc2 Online Correction: June 26, 2016, Sunday\par \par \uc2 This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: Because of an editing error, an earlier version of this article misstated the day on which Britain voted on a referendum on whether to leave the \uc2 European Union\uc2 .

\par\par \uc2 LETTER FROM WASHINGTON\par \uc2 National Desk; SECT\par \b \uc2 Ballot Is Expected to Offer Stark Choice on Economy\b0\par\par\uc2 By ALBERT R. HUNT | BLOOMBERG VIEW \par \uc2 677 \uc2 words\par \uc2 27 June 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 The New York Times on the Web\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 The contempt that \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  and \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2  express for each other will continue to play out in vitriolic sound bites. But their profound differences on what to do about the economy and the struggling middle class are far more important.\par \par \uc2 ''This \uc2 election\uc2  will be won by whichever candidate convinces middle-class voters they are better for their jobs and future prospects,'' said Stephen Moore, an economist at the Heritage Foundation and an adviser to Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Gene B. Sperling, a leading economic official under President \uc2 Bill \uc2 Clinton\uc2  and President Obama, and an adviser to Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , said, ''This is about whether economic forces hollow out the middle class or whether those forces strengthen the middle class, creating jobs and higher wages.''\par \par \uc2 As the economy has recovered from the 2008 crisis, the unemployment rate has shrunk to less than half of what it was eight years ago and wages have started to rise. But median average family income, in real dollars, is less than it was 10 years ago.\par \par \uc2 On the issue voters say is their top concern, the two presumptive nominees offer radically different remedies. Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  goes out of her way to show that most of her initiatives are paid for.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , in defiance of Republican orthodoxy, seems unfazed by debt. He proudly says that borrowing fueled his business ventures and has even suggested that as president, he might try to negotiate down American debt obligations.\par \par \uc2 Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's agenda includes calls for a higher minimum wage, 12 weeks' paid leave for chronically ill workers and parents with a newborn, more funds for job training and education, especially higher education, and a $275 billion infrastructure plan.\par \par \uc2 She would raise taxes by $1.1 trillion over the next decade, the \uc2 Tax Policy Center\uc2  estimates. These raises are mainly aimed at wealthier Americans and include higher capital gains taxes on assets held for longer periods, a larger estate tax for wealthy heirs, and closing some corporate loopholes and advantages enjoyed by hedge fund and private equity executives.\par \par \uc2 These increases will be offset, however, by a subsequent middle-class tax cut.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , by contrast, has offered huge tax cuts, which policy experts estimate will cost $9 trillion to $11 trillion over a decade. He also vows to end or soften many federal regulations, which he calls job killers. Look for him to focus on a pro-growth energy policy that his camp calculates would split two of Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's important constituencies: labor and environmentalists.\par \par \uc2 But the core of Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's proposals for job creation involves getting tough on trade by renegotiating previous treaties and imposing heavy duties on imports, particularly from China or Mexico. Although international laws and the need for congressional approval could inhibit such actions, a president does have flexibility to impose some trade sanctions.\par \par \uc2 In the coming months, each candidate will be pressed to provide more specifics; Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  has been especially vague.\par \par \uc2 He has delegated two advocates of supply-side tax cuts to revise his plan to make it less costly. One of them, Mr. Moore of \uc2 the Heritage Foundation\uc2 , says the objective is to cut the projected deficit by at least two-thirds, to around $3 trillion over a decade. This, he says, would be achieved primarily by limiting deductions for upper-income taxpayers.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Sperling suggests that a middle-class tax cut, higher education and a larger infrastructure plan ''are candidates for expansion'' by Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Until more specifics are forthcoming, it is difficult to gauge the economic impact of either candidate's plans. Several economic analyses, including those by Moody's Analytics and the \uc2 U.S. Chamber of Commerce\uc2 , have estimated that Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's plans, primarily because they rely on protectionism, deportation of undocumented workers and debt, would throw the economy into a recession. Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  rejects that contention and says that he would create growth of 6 percent a year, a level last achieved in 1983.\par \par \uc2 Document NYTF000020160627ec6r0004n\par }\par \b \uc2
