\par\par \uc2 National Desk; SECTA\par \b \uc2 Early Voting Limits the Time for \uc2 Trump\uc2  to Save Campaign\b0\par\par\uc2 By PATRICK HEALY \par \uc2 1,318 \uc2 words\par \uc2 17 August 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 1\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Advisers to \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2  keep reassuring Republicans that there is still plenty of time to rescue his candidacy -- nearly three months to counter \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's vast operation in swing states and get Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  on message.\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 Trump\uc2  team had better check the calendar.\par \par \uc2 Voting actually starts in less than six weeks, on Sept. 23 in Minnesota and South Dakota, the first of some 35 states and the District of Columbia that allow people to cast ballots at polling sites or by mail before Nov. 8. Iowa is expected to have ballots ready by the end of September, as are Illinois and two other states.\par \par \uc2 The electoral battlegrounds of Arizona and Ohio are to begin voting on Oct. 12, nearly four weeks before \uc2 Election\uc2  Day. And North Carolina and Florida will be underway before Halloween.\par \par \uc2 Early voting has become a critical, even decisive factor in presidential elections: President Obama was sufficiently ahead in the early vote in Iowa and Nevada in 2012 that his campaign shifted resources from those states to others, according to former advisers, who also credited enthusiastic early voting in 2008 for his victory in North Carolina and elsewhere.\par \par \uc2 Nearly 32 percent of voters cast their ballots before \uc2 Election\uc2  Day in 2012, according to census data, compared with 29.7 percent in 2008 and 20 percent in 2004.\par \par \uc2 With Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  spending aggressively to try to dominate the early vote, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , who has repeatedly created distractions for himself in the past two weeks, is in jeopardy not just of being outmaneuvered but also of running out of chances to improve perceptions of him enough to win over undecided voters.\par \par \uc2 ''When you have something as catastrophic as the \uc2 Trump\uc2  campaign is becoming, there aren't enough weeks left to turn things around, and little ability to organize effectively and capture a strong share of the early vote,'' said Mike Murphy, a veteran Republican strategist who worked on behalf of Jeb Bush during the primaries.\par \par \uc2 If Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  swamps Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  in the early vote in some swing states, she can move staff and money to the most competitive places -- like Florida, North Carolina and Ohio, judging from recent polls -- while he scrambles to battle on multiple fronts.\par \par \uc2 ''As many as 40 percent of voters cast ballots in the early states, and you can't organize overnight, or even in just a few weeks, and win them,'' said Neil Newhouse, who was \uc2 Mitt Romney\uc2 's pollster in 2012. ''Truthfully, if the \uc2 Clinton\uc2  campaign inherited what the Obama campaign put together, they've got to have a head start in this over the \uc2 Trump\uc2  campaign.''\par \par \uc2 Indeed, Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's team, which includes a number of former top Obama campaign lieutenants, has been working with county officials to ensure that voters in swing states have places to cast their ballots early, organizing voters at the neighborhood level, and contacting those who may not know that they must request absentee ballots in jurisdictions that do not automatically send them.\par \par \uc2 Some \uc2 Clinton\uc2  allies are also organizing ''souls to the polls'' buses that take church members to vote immediately after Sunday church services in Democratic strongholds like Cleveland.\par \par \uc2 Early voters tend to be older and more partisan, and many choose to cast absentee ballots by mail, while others prefer to go to polling sites during special evening and weekend hours. In Arizona, many vote early rather than stand in long lines in the heat on \uc2 Election\uc2  Day.\par \par \uc2 Early voting rules and times vary widely by state, and some Republican-led legislatures have sought to put new limits on options like Sunday and evening voting -- attempts that have been struck down in several court rulings. The \uc2 Clinton\uc2  campaign has ''voter protection teams'' of lawyers pushing for as much early voting as possible.\par \par \uc2 ''In every state, our goal is to use all available tools so more voters have their voices heard in this \uc2 election\uc2  -- whether that's by mail, early vote, absentee, or on \uc2 Election\uc2  Day,'' said Marlon Marshall, the \uc2 Clinton\uc2  campaign's director of state campaigns and engagement. ''We've been working for months to reach out to voters to make casting their ballot as easy and accessible as possible.''\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  is lagging far behind. Unlike Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , he has not been running television ads, which are crucial for engaging early voters, and he has state organizers of varying experience levels and scattershot ground troops in most places. His campaign is leaning on the \uc2 Republican National Committee\uc2  to open state offices to help with early voting. Both Mr. Romney and the 2008 Republican nominee, Senator \uc2 John McCain\uc2 , had more aggressive operations at this point.\par \par \uc2 Paul Manafort\uc2 , Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's campaign chairman, said he did not think early voting would put Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  at a disadvantage, expressing confidence that the campaign's ground operation would be well organized and executed and that Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  would ultimately attract enough undecided voters to win.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Manafort said the presidential debates would be critical for Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 ; in the past, strong debate performances have led to a surge in early voting for the perceived winner, a boost that Mr. Romney enjoyed after he was widely seen as beating Mr. Obama in their first debate.\par \par \uc2 ''We are organizing for this,'' Mr. Manafort said about early voting. ''We have very experienced people involved.'' He declined to provide details.\par \par \uc2 After Mr. Romney's performance in that first 2012 debate, Republicans turned out in droves to vote or cast absentee ballots; Mr. Obama recovered in the next debate, and his ground forces mobilized so strongly in some places that he was able to cut back on campaigning in some key states. He visited Des Moines on the eve of the \uc2 election\uc2  ''for nostalgia, not need,'' said \uc2 David Plouffe\uc2 , a longtime Obama adviser.\par \par \uc2 ''If you have an accurate model of how you are performing in early vote, you have an exact picture of where the race stands,'' Mr. Plouffe said. In 2012, he added, the early vote trends in Iowa and Nevada meant ''we could spend more time and money in Florida, most importantly.'' Mr. Obama ended up winning Iowa and Nevada by about six percentage points and carried Florida with a one-point margin, he said.\par \par \uc2 But Mr. Obama and Mr. Romney also had campaign organizations capable of capitalizing on strong debate performances. ''I don't know if \uc2 Trump\uc2  has a great debate or gets a spike in support after it,'' said Mr. Murphy, the Republican strategist, ''but he certainly doesn't have the machinery to take advantage of it by getting those people to the polls.''\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  has pointed to the usually large numbers of people at his rallies, and their evident enthusiasm, as signs of strong support that will translate into energetic early voters. But during the Republican primaries, some \uc2 Trump\uc2  admirers at his rallies admitted they were not registered and had no plans to vote, and \uc2 Trump\uc2  advisers say that their voter registration efforts have been relatively modest.\par \par \uc2 Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , by contrast, urges people at her rallies to register to vote, pointing them to clipboard-carrying volunteers who have forms to dispense and details about when, where and how to cast ballots.\par \par \uc2 ''Hillary's getting into early voting details while \uc2 Trump\uc2  can't get past making awful sound bites,'' said Bill Carrick, a Democratic strategist and media consultant. ''The idea that he can fix things and win over swing voters in the final week or two -- that's not how elections are won anymore. It's wishful thinking.''\par \par \uc2 Find out what you need to know about the 2016 presidential race today, and get politics news updates via \uc2 Facebook\uc2 , \uc2 Twitter\uc2  and the First Draft newsletter.\par \par \uc2 (A1); Early voting in Waterloo, Iowa, in 2012.

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 First there was ''low energy.'' Now increasingly it's ''no stamina.''\par \par \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2  dispatched his Republican primary opponents with the power of branding, most notably billing Jeb Bush as a weak-wattage candidate who lacked the pizazz to be president. As Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  faces an uphill battle in the general \uc2 election\uc2  campaign against \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , the Republican presidential nominee is trying to reprise the winning formula that got him this far, slipping it into rallies and speeches that his opponent appears too tired to lead the country.\par \par \uc2 In a prominent national security address on Monday, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  could not have been more explicit when he said that Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  ''lacks the mental and physical stamina to take on ISIS, and all the many adversaries we face.''\par \par \uc2 The remark drew chortles on social media, with some pointing out that the commander in chief is not needed on the front lines against the Islamic State these days and others recalling that Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  received a draft deferment during the Vietnam Warbecause of bone spurs in his feet. Women on \uc2 Twitter\uc2  said the comment reeked of sexism. The former tennis star Martina Navratilova wondered if Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  was giving himself too much credit.\par \par \uc2 Trump\uc2  Questions \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's 'Mental And Physical Stamina'- anybody wants to see DT in a t- shirt and shorts?:) {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://t.co/D6HItLwVab"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 https://t.co/D6HItLwVab}}}\uc2  -- Martina Navratilova (@Martina) August 15, 2016\par \par \uc2 But Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , who has also given Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  the moniker ''Crooked Hillary,'' has clearly settled on the line of attack as one that will stick and sting.\par \par \uc2 At a rally in Florida last week, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  criticized Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  for giving short speeches and not campaigning with sufficient vigor.\par \par \uc2 ''She makes the speech, she turns off the teleprompter,'' Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  said. ''Look, what happens, she gives a short speech then she goes home, goes to sleep, she shows up two days later.''\par \par \uc2 Referring to Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's remark that she may have ''short-circuited'' when discussing her private email server, he added: ''Remember, short circuit. Remember that, right? Short circuit.''\par \par \uc2 However, tarring Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  as tired is not entirely new for Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 During a speech in June, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  tried to explain the death of Ambassador Chris Stevens in the 2012 attacks in Benghazi, Libya, as a result of Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's fatigue.\par \par \uc2 ''He was left helpless to die as \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  soundly slept in her bed,'' Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  said. ''That's right. When the phone rang, as per the commercial, at 3 in the morning, \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  was sleeping.''\par \par \uc2 And Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  tested a similar line late last year in Iowa when he suggested that Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  was spending too little time in the state.\par \par \uc2 ''You don't see her for five or six days,'' said Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , who frequently flies home to his Manhattan penthouse after most days on the campaign trail. ''She goes home, goes to sleep.''\par \par \uc2 The questioning of Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's energy levels comes as some of her conservative critics have been trying to push the narrative that she is battling an undisclosed illness that makes her unfit for the presidency. Last week, the Fox News host Sean Hannity devoted considerable time on Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's rumored medical problems. The right-wing Drudge Report has also prominently displayed images of Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  appearing to stumble and looking unwell.\par \par \uc2 Kathleen Hall Jamieson, a communications professor at the University of Pennsylvania, said that Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  appeared to be nodding to age and sex stereotypes of women being too frail to handle strenuous activities.\par \par \uc2 ''He is playing into that loop of clips that Sean Hannity is playing,'' Ms. Jamieson said. ''What does it mean that she's not up to it? It could be 'she's a woman and you know what happens when a woman gets older.'''\par \par \uc2 Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  has generally laughed off questions about her fitness, often reminding skeptics that she logged nearly a million miles as secretary of state.\par \par \uc2 Find out what you need to know about the 2016 presidential race today, and get politics news updates via \uc2 Facebook\uc2 , \uc2 Twitter\uc2  and the First Draft newsletter.\par \par \uc2 Document NYTF000020160817ec8h0004k\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  has opened a nine-percentage-point lead over \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2  in Florida, according to a new poll released on Tuesday that shows minority voters and women buttressing her presidential campaign.\par \par \uc2 The survey from \uc2 Monmouth University\uc2  found that 48 percent of likely voters support Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , while 39 percent back Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 . \uc2 Gary Johnson\uc2  of the Libertarian Party trails with 6 percent and the Green Party's Jill Stein has 1 percent.\par \par \uc2 The margin is wider than other Florida polls that show Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  trailing by about four points in the state, where he maintains a residence and scored a resounding victory in the primary \uc2 election\uc2 . With Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  leading in several battleground states, Florida could prove essential for Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's chances in November.\par \par \uc2 ''The gender split among white voters in Florida is huge,'' said \uc2 Patrick Murray\uc2 , director of the Monmouth University Polling Institute. ''Men are drawn to \uc2 Trump\uc2 's message while women are not. These offsetting factors give \uc2 Clinton\uc2  the edge.''\par \par \uc2 Race is also a big factor in Florida and Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  has the support of 69 percent of nonwhite voters. While Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  has a 14-point lead among white voters, this is smaller than the 24-point advantage that \uc2 Mitt Romney\uc2 , the 2012 Republican nominee, had in the \uc2 election\uc2  four years ago.\par \par \uc2 Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  is also outperforming Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  in areas that in recent months have been his strengths: the economy and terrorism. More Florida voters now see the Democratic nominee as being better suited to steer the economy, create jobs and handle the threat of an attack on American soil.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  handily defeated Senator \uc2 Marco Rubio\uc2  of Florida in the state's primary in March and the fact that he is struggling in the state could now weigh on Mr. Rubio's re-\uc2 election\uc2  hopes. So far, Mr. Rubio, who decided late to run again, is maintaining a modest lead against his leading Democratic rival, Representative Patrick Murphy.\par \par \uc2 According to the Monmouth poll, a majority of Florida voters are not aware that Mr. Rubio endorsed Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's presidential bid, and most who do know say it will not determine if they vote for him.\par \par \uc2 The poll had a margin of error of plus or minus five percentage points.\par \par \uc2 Document NYTF000020160817ec8h0004j\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 National Desk; SECTA\par \b \uc2 A Warning by \uc2 Clinton\uc2 : Do Not Be Complacent\b0\par\par\uc2 By MATT FLEGENHEIMER \par \uc2 619 \uc2 words\par \uc2 17 August 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 12\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 PHILADELPHIA -- \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  does not dispute that the presidential campaign is going well for her at the moment.\par \par \uc2 But she would rather not dwell on it.\par \par \uc2 ''Don't be complacent, my friends!'' she told supporters on Tuesday inside a high school gym in West Philadelphia. ''Even though we're doing fine right now, I'm not taking anyone, anywhere, for granted.''\par \par \uc2 As Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  seizes polling advantages over \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2  in essentially every traditional swing state, her team is working to keep supporters energized and engaged, reminding them that winning public surveys in August is worth exactly zero electoral votes in November.\par \par \uc2 Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's visit here on Tuesday -- in the heart of a Democratic neighborhood, in a Democratic city, in what has been a Democratic state in six consecutive presidential races -- was aimed squarely at this decidedly first-world problem.\par \par \uc2 Often sounding as much like a field organizer as a major party nominee, Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  ticked off the particulars of what has become a signature venture of her bid: the registration of three million Americans before \uc2 Election\uc2  Day.\par \par \uc2 In Pennsylvania alone, the campaign said, more than three dozen coordinated campaign and \uc2 Democratic National Committee\uc2  offices have been opened, with plans for 10 more this week. The campaign said it had made more than 1.3 million phone calls in the state, with volunteers logging some 28,000 hours.\par \par \uc2 ''We know what we need to do. The question is whether we will do it,'' Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  said. ''And that all comes down to who shows up and votes.''\par \par \uc2 Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  directed attendees to the ''people waving over there'' in a corner of the gym, with registration forms. She reminded them of the deadline. She asked residents to canvass for her.\par \par \uc2 She recited the address of a new office in West Philadelphia -- ''57th and Cedar! Stop by!'' -- and reminded the crowd of the records of the last two Democratic presidents.\par \par \uc2 ''President Obama,'' she began, to cheers, ''and a guy named \uc2 Clinton\uc2 .''\par \par \uc2 Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  herself was not always so popular in the city, at least compared with her former rival. Though Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  won the Democratic primary in 2008, Senator \uc2 Barack Obama\uc2  earned far more support in Philadelphia, dominating in predominantly black areas like West Philadelphia.\par \par \uc2 Eight years later, she defeated Senator Bernie Sanders in the Pennsylvania primary, outpacing him comfortably in the city.\par \par \uc2 On Tuesday, she suggested to voters that merely winning in November was not the only goal.\par \par \uc2 ''I'm not trying to just win an \uc2 election\uc2 ,'' Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  said. ''I'm trying to build a base of voters who understand that we've got to stand up for these rights, we have to work for these causes.''\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , who almost certainly needs to win Pennsylvania to win the presidency, is hoping to contend in the state by running up huge margins with blue-collar voters, particularly white men.\par \par \uc2 He has said, absent evidence, that he will only lose Pennsylvania ''if cheating goes on.''\par \par \uc2 Addressing the room before Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  arrived on Tuesday, State Senator Vincent Hughes urged residents not to ''get Trumped.''\par \par \uc2 ''This has not been Hillary's first time in West Philadelphia,'' he said. ''She knows these neighborhoods.''\par \par \uc2 As he finished, a volunteer's cry filled the space: ''Anyone need to register?''\par \par \uc2 Find out what you need to know about the 2016 presidential race today, and get politics news updates via \uc2 Facebook\uc2 , \uc2 Twitter\uc2  and the First Draft newsletter.\par \par \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  greeted Pennsylvanians, at least one not yet of voting age, at a campaign event on Wednesday at a high school in West Philadelphia.

\par\par \b \uc2 Election\uc2  2016: \uc2 FBI\uc2  Turns Over \uc2 Clinton\uc2  Probe Material --- Grassley calls for release of documents where possible; agency opposes move\b0\par\par\uc2 By Devlin Barrett   \par \uc2 537 \uc2 words\par \uc2 17 August 2016\par \uc2 The Wall Street Journal\par \uc2 J\par A4\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 WASHINGTON -- The \uc2 Federal Bureau of Investigation\uc2  on Tuesday gave Congress a written summary of interviews with \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  and some of her key aides, a move likely to further fuel political fights over her much-criticized use of private email to do government business.\par \par \uc2 In response, Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman \uc2 Charles Grassley\uc2  (R., Iowa) said much of the information should be released publicly to shed more light on the investigation that has dogged Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  as she pursued and won the Democratic nomination for president.\par \par \uc2 "The \uc2 FBI\uc2  should make as much of the material available as possible," Mr. Grassley said in a statement. "The public's business ought to be public, with few exceptions. The people's interest would be served in seeing the documents that are unclassified."\par \par \uc2 Mr. Grassley said the \uc2 FBI\uc2  sent interview summaries and supporting materials. He added that much of the material isn't classified but is marked for official use only.\par \par \uc2 According to a person familiar with the matter, the unclassified portions of the \uc2 FBI\uc2 's material weren't heavily redacted, with the exception of some names. However, some material that cited \uc2 Central Intelligence Agency\uc2  interests was redacted entirely and provided only to the congressional intelligence committees.\par \par \uc2 In addition to the interview summaries, the \uc2 FBI\uc2  also provided lawmakers on several congressional committees with copies of the 110 emails found on Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's server that contained classified information, though those emails had previously been provided to some members of Congress.\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 FBI\uc2  in July announced it had concluded its investigation of Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's use of a private email server to conduct government business as secretary of state. FBI Director James Comey said that while they found careless behavior they found no reason to charge anyone with a crime.\par \par \uc2 Republicans, who have long criticized Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  over the email practices, have questioned the \uc2 FBI\uc2 's conclusions and demanded to see more details from its case file.\par \par \uc2 In a rare moment of agreement, the \uc2 Clinton\uc2  campaign also argued for the public release of much of the material so that voters can judge the materials for themselves.\par \par \uc2 "This is an extraordinarily rare step that was sought solely by Republicans for the purposes of further second-guessing the career professionals at the \uc2 FBI\uc2 ," a \uc2 Clinton\uc2  campaign spokesman said. "We believe that if these materials are going to be shared outside the Justice Department, they should be released widely so that the public can see them for themselves, rather than allow Republicans to mischaracterize them through selective, partisan leaks."\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 FBI\uc2 , however, in a statement urged that the material not be made public or leaked by the lawmakers and congressional aides who are reviewing it.\par \par \uc2 "The material contains classified and other sensitive information and is being provided with the expectation it will not be disseminated or disclosed without \uc2 FBI\uc2  concurrence," the \uc2 FBI\uc2  said.\par \par \uc2 Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  has said she made a mistake in using a private email server but said she never sent or received any information that was marked classified.\par \par \uc2 ---\par \par \uc2 Byron Tau contributed to this article.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=wjco20160817000132"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document J000000020160817ec8h0004f\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw272\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4080\pichgoal600

Ken Salazar of Colorado, who also was a secretary of the interior, will serve as chairman of Democratic presidential nominee \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's transition team. He will manage the pre-\uc2 election\uc2  effort designed to ensure Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  is prepared to enter office in January if she wins the November \uc2 election\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 In addition, former national security adviser \uc2 Tom Donilon\uc2 , former Michigan Gov. Jennifer Granholm, Center for American Progress President Neera Tanden and Harvard University Institute of Politics director Maggie Williams will serve as co-chairs. Ms. Tanden was the policy director for Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's 2008 presidential campaign, and previously served in her Senate office. Ms. Williams served as a campaign manager for the 2008 race.\par \par \uc2 Ed Meier and Ann O'Leary will run the day-to-day operations of the transition effort as co-executive directors. Both were previously policy advisers to Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's campaign and will shift now into Washington-based planning roles. Heather Boushey will serve as the transition's chief economist.\par \par \uc2 Republican nominee \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  announced in May that New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie had been tapped to fill the role of transition chair for his campaign.

\par\par \b \uc2 Election\uc2  2016: Suburbanites Aid \uc2 Clinton\uc2  in Pennsylvania\b0\par\par\uc2 By Byron Tau and Michael C. Bender   \par \uc2 599 \uc2 words\par \uc2 17 August 2016\par \uc2 The Wall Street Journal\par \uc2 J\par A4\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 PHILADELPHIA -- \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  has energized the plentiful working-class, white voters in Pennsylvania, but \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's lead among African-Americans here and her growing hold on suburban voters have suddenly made Republican hopes of winning this battleground look more remote.\par \par \uc2 Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's lead in the RealClearPolitics aggregate of polls had narrowed to less than a single percentage point in June, but it has now grown to nearly 10 points. A top super PAC backing Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , Priorities USA, on Monday said it was suspending its ads in Pennsylvania, Virginia and Colorado, citing Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's lead in the polls in those states.\par \par \uc2 David Plouffe\uc2 , who orchestrated President \uc2 Barack Obama\uc2 's 2008 campaign, said a \uc2 Trump\uc2  victory in Pennsylvania would now depend on "historically catastrophic" turnout among Democrats and "astronomical" performance from Republicans. "It's not going to happen," he said in an interview.\par \par \uc2 Trump\uc2  campaign officials still views Pennsylvania as competitive, telling lawmakers Tuesday that the state is one of five where they plan to start airing TV ads. David Urban, a senior adviser for \uc2 Trump\uc2 's campaign in Pennsylvania, contends that Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's message of political change will resonate in the state.\par \par \uc2 On Tuesday, Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  came here seeking to cement her support among African-American voters, a central part of her coalition. Speaking at an event in a predominantly black West Philadelphia neighborhood, she urged her supporters not to be complacent. "Even though we're doing fine right now, I'm not taking anybody, anywhere for granted," she said.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  had support from a mere 1% of Pennsylvania's African-American voters in a Wall Street Journal/NBC News/Marist poll earlier this month, with Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  taking 94%. Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's lead was wider than the 93%-to-7% margin won in the 2012 \uc2 election\uc2  by President \uc2 Barack Obama\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 For Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , like other Democrats, the key to winning Pennsylvania is to run up big margins in and around Philadelphia, home to many minority voters. In 2012, Mr. Obama topped his Republican rival, \uc2 Mitt Romney\uc2 , by nearly 500,000 votes in Philadelphia alone, putting him on track for a 300,000-vote, or 5-percentage-point, victory in the state.\par \par \uc2 Republican's point to Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's strength among the state's large bloc of white voters without a four-year college degree, one way of defining working-class whites, as the key to putting the state in the GOP column for the first time since 1988.\par \par \uc2 In the Journal/NBC/Marist survey, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  had a 16-point lead among those voters, compared with a slightly narrower 14-point margin that exit polls showed Mr. Romney winning in Pennsylvania in 2012.\par \par \uc2 Rob Gleason, the state Republican Party chairman, said he expected Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  to perform well in the western part of the state, far from Philadelphia, and in other places where working-class voters have been buffeted by the decline of manufacturing. While Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  draws more support from working-class white voters than did Mr. Romney, he's drawing far fewer college-educated white voters. Many of those voters live in the Philadelphia suburbs, where Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  had built a lead of 52% to 26% over Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  in the poll.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  said at a recent campaign stop that cheating or fraud was the only way he would lose Pennsylvania. His campaign is recruiting "\uc2 election\uc2  observers" in swing states to help monitor the polls for any problems.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=wjco20160817000113"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document J000000020160817ec8h0003w\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw272\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4080\pichgoal600

Based on a net approval rating for \uc2 Barack Obama\uc2  of +6 in the Gallup weekly tracking poll for the week of June 27-July 4, an estimated second quarter change in real GDP of 1.2% according to the \uc2 Bureau of Economic Analysis\uc2 , and the fact that \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  is seeking a third consecutive Democratic term in the White House, the Time for Change Model predicts a narrow victory for \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  -- 51.4% of the major party vote to 48.6%. . . .\par \par \uc2 Based on a predicted vote share of 48.6% for the incumbent party, these results indicate that \uc2 Trump\uc2  should be a clear but not overwhelming favorite to defeat \uc2 Clinton\uc2 : There should be about a 66% chance of a Republican victory.\par \par \uc2 Despite the excellent track record of the Time for Change model, there are good reasons to be skeptical about the 2016 forecast. For one thing, the overwhelming majority of national polls during the spring and summer of 2016 have shown \uc2 Clinton\uc2  leading \uc2 Trump\uc2 . National polls completed shortly before and after the national party conventions gave \uc2 Clinton\uc2  an average lead of about five percentage points, and \uc2 Clinton\uc2  is up by about eight points now. Beyond the poll results, the Time for Change forecasting model is based on two crucial assumptions -- first, that both major parties will nominate mainstream candidates capable of unifying their parties and, second, that the candidates will conduct equally effective campaigns so that the overall outcome will closely reflect the "fundamentals" incorporated in the model. . . .\par \par \uc2 The nomination of \uc2 Trump\uc2  by the Republican Party in 2016 appears to violate both of the Time for Change model's key assumptions. \uc2 Trump\uc2  is clearly not a mainstream Republican and he does not appear to be running a competent campaign -- he has lagged far behind \uc2 Clinton\uc2  in both fundraising and grassroots organizing in the swing states, and his rhetoric on the campaign trail has frequently brought sharp criticism from prominent Republicans as well as Democrats. . . .\par \par \uc2 Based on the results of other recent presidential elections, however, as well as \uc2 Trump\uc2 's extraordinary unpopularity, it appears very likely that the Republican vote share will fall several points below what would be expected if the GOP had nominated a mainstream candidate and that candidate had run a reasonably competent campaign.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=wjco20160817000069"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document J000000020160817ec8h0002o\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw272\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4080\pichgoal600

Galston   \par \uc2 796 \uc2 words\par \uc2 17 August 2016\par \uc2 The Wall Street Journal\par \uc2 J\par A9\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 No one can be wrong about everything, not even \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2 . Buried within his blunderbuss attack on globalism is an important truth: The surge of imports that came after China joined the \uc2 World Trade Organization\uc2  in 2001 has devastated U.S. manufacturing workers.\par \par \uc2 Between the start of 1989 and the end of 1992, manufacturing employment fell from 18.1 million to 16.8 million, according to estimates from the \uc2 Bureau of Labor Statistics\uc2 . But then it stabilized. During President \uc2 Bill \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's two terms, growth in output was more than enough to compensate for rising imports and productivity. By the time Mr. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  left office, manufacturing employment had increased to 17.1 million.\par \par \uc2 Then the roof fell in. Between January 2001 and December 2007, the official beginning of the Great Recession, manufacturing employment fell by 3.4 million. During the next two years, it fell another 2.2 million. By January of 2010, the figure was 11.5 million, down 5.6 million -- nearly 33% -- in less than a decade. Since then it has inched up by 800,000 jobs to 12.3 million.\par \par \uc2 What was China's contribution to this calamity? In 2013 the economists David Autor, David Dorn, and Gordon Hanson published their pathbreaking study "The China Syndrome." Competition from imports, they concluded, explains about one quarter of the aggregate decline in U.S. manufacturing employment between 1990 and 2007. In the most affected regions, public expenditures ballooned for unemployment, disability, retirement and health-care benefits, compounding the economic damage.\par \par \uc2 "Theory suggests that trade with China yields aggregate gains for the US economy," the authors wrote, but in practice the effects were more mixed. Workers and communities struggled to adjust to the trade shock. Their difficulties doing so worsened inequality. The labor market is anything but the frictionless process that theory typically posits.\par \par \uc2 The three economists returned to the fray this year, joined by \uc2 Daron Acemoglu\uc2  and Brendan Price. In "Import Competition and the Great US Employment Sag of the 2000s," they conclude that the flood of imports was a major force behind not only declining manufacturing employment but also weak overall job growth between 1999 and 2011. During this period, they estimate, competition from Chinese imports caused job losses in the range of 2 million to 2.4 million, enough to cut overall employment gains by about half.\par \par \uc2 Two more economists, Justin Pierce and Peter Schott, added an article pungently titled "The Surprisingly Swift Decline of U.S. Manufacturing Employment," which they trace to China's accession to the \uc2 WTO\uc2 . The most exposed industrial sectors experienced the largest increase in Chinese imports and the greatest losses of employment. Adding to the effect on workers, many American plants responded by investing in labor-saving production methods while increasing their reliance on offshore production.\par \par \uc2 Messrs. Autor, Dorn and Hanson speculated in their 2013 paper that the consequences of the surge in Chinese imports "may contribute to public ambivalence toward globalization and specific anxiety about increasing trade with China." The past three years amply confirmed this prediction, as the hardest-hit communities tacked toward populism and economic nationalism.\par \par \uc2 Riding a tide of blue-collar resentment, \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2 , the most trade-skeptical Republican presidential candidate in decades, snatched the nomination from a bevy of more traditionally minded aspirants. On the Democratic side, \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  was compelled to renounce her previous support for the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal. Responding to widespread doubts about the durability of her conversion, she declared last week that "I oppose it now. I'll oppose it after the \uc2 election\uc2 , and I'll oppose it as president."\par \par \uc2 Make no mistake: This statement is the political equivalent of George H.W. Bush's pledge to "read my lips: no new taxes." Breaking that promise helped lead to President Bush's 1992 defeat. If Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  were to support TPP after taking the White House, the consequences would be equally dire.\par \par \uc2 This means that the postelection lame-duck session of Congress is do-or-die for TPP. President Obama continues to advocate the trade deal. "We are part of a global economy," he said last week. "The notion that we're going to pull that up root and branch is unrealistic."\par \par \uc2 So it is. But if this fourth-quarter push falls short of the goal line, as it may well, Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  will be left with the task of rebuilding support for an international economic agenda. This will have to begin with credible steps, which the U.S. has never taken, to compensate the millions of Americans who have lost ground and to provide them with a path to a decent future.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=wjco20160817000031"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document J000000020160817ec8h0001m\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw272\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4080\pichgoal600

The names have been changed, so the stories are missing Ollie North, Fawn Hall and the Contras. It is important to remember that President \uc2 Jimmy Carter\uc2  refused to bargain with Iran to regain the prisoners, nor would he launch a war; his indecision cost him the \uc2 election\uc2 .

\par\par \b \uc2 Evading the Constitution to Ban Nuclear Tests\b0\par\par\uc2 By Jon Kyl and Douglas J. Feith   \par \uc2 887 \uc2 words\par \uc2 16 August 2016\par \uc2 The Wall Street Journal\par \uc2 J\par A11\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 Barack Obama\uc2  has done more than any predecessor to increase presidential power and diminish Congress's constitutional role. He gave the Senate virtually no voice in the Iran nuclear deal and he now plans to undercut the Senate's treaty-making authority even further. The subject this time is the \uc2 Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty\uc2 , a 1996 agreement to ban explosive testing of nuclear weapons.\par \par \uc2 The Senate has already considered and rejected the CTBT. To circumvent Congress, Mr. Obama wants the United Nations to declare nuclear tests illegal. This is an affront to the Constitution and bad nuclear policy.\par \par \uc2 The United States has not done an explosive nuclear test since 1992. U.S. officials rely on computer simulations to ensure nuclear-weapon safety and reliability. The no-test policy was adopted as a nuclear nonproliferation gesture, in hopes of persuading other countries to similarly restrain themselves. Yet experts worry that the safety and reliability of U.S. nuclear weapons cannot be ensured forever without tests, for there are uncertainties in the relevant chemistry and physics. At some point computer simulations may not provide enough confidence.\par \par \uc2 Then-Secretary of Defense \uc2 Robert Gates\uc2  noted in a 2008 speech that U.S. nuclear weapons "were designed on the assumption of a limited shelf life." Because "sensitive parts do not last forever," he said, the U.S. re-engineers them to extend their lifespan, but "with every adjustment we move further away from the original design that was successfully tested when the weapon was first fielded." At some point, he warned, it will become "impossible to keep extending the life of our arsenal, especially in light of our testing moratorium."\par \par \uc2 Because the U.S. no-test policy is a unilateral measure, any president can change it in the future. If America became a CTBT party, however, that policy would harden into a permanent international legal obligation to refrain from testing.\par \par \uc2 Negotiated in the 1990s, the CTBT won approval from the \uc2 U.N. General Assembly\uc2  in 1996 and President Bill \uc2 Clinton\uc2  promptly signed it. He then asked the Senate to ratify.\par \par \uc2 Senate opponents of the CTBT highlighted a number of flaws. Among the gravest was lack of agreement on what the treaty prohibits. The bipartisan 2009 Perry-Schlesinger commission report summarized the opponents' case: "The treaty remarkably does not define a nuclear test. In practice this allows different interpretations of its prohibitions and asymmetrical restrictions. The strict U.S. interpretation precludes tests that produce nuclear yield. However, other countries with different interpretations could conduct [low-yield] tests . . . . Apparently Russia and possibly China are conducting low-yield tests."\par \par \uc2 Senators also complained that the CTBT isn't verifiable or enforceable: The Russians, Chinese or others could violate it and the U.S. would not necessarily be able to detect, let alone prove, the violation. Taking effective action to compel compliance would be difficult or even impossible.\par \par \uc2 Allies and partners around the world have positioned themselves for decades under America's so-called nuclear umbrella. Rather than create their own nuclear arsenals, they rely on America for their security. This makes America -- and the world -- safer than if there were numerous nuclear states.\par \par \uc2 Imagine, however, the following scenario: Technical problems develop in U.S. warheads and responsible scientists say that tests are needed to confirm reliability. If America were legally bound not to test, that would undermine faith in its nuclear umbrella and other countries might decide they need their own nuclear weapons. The CTBT could thus aggravate the very problem of nuclear proliferation that it was created to help solve.\par \par \uc2 These concerns led the Senate in 1999 to reject the CTBT. The rejection was not close. Instead of receiving the necessary two-thirds majority (67 votes) for approval, the CTBT won 48 votes, while 51 senators voted against it.\par \par \uc2 Despite this, President Obama wants to make U.S. nuclear tests illegal, and an unprecedented maneuver in the \uc2 U.N\uc2 . would allow him to shut the Senate out. Mr. Obama plans to propose a \uc2 U.N. Security Council\uc2  resolution declaring that any nuclear test would be an action inconsistent with the CTBT's "object and purpose." Under international law, this would make the ban applicable to countries that are merely treaty signatories -- that is, those that have signed but not ratified. The U.S. remains in that category even though the Senate voted the treaty down.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Obama wants to attach the label "illegal" to nuclear testing without the Senate's advice and consent. This is the way progressive transnational lawyers use courts and multilateral organizations to circumvent legislatures.\par \par \uc2 A future U.S. president could, in effect, unsign the CTBT, but that doesn't make it proper for Mr. Obama to abuse international legal mechanisms to inflate his executive power at the expense of the Senate. In this particular presidential \uc2 election\uc2  season, it's especially important to show respect, not contempt, for the Constitution.\par \par \uc2 ---\par \par \uc2 Mr. Kyl served three terms as a U.S. senator from Arizona. Mr. Feith, a senior fellow at \uc2 Hudson Institute\uc2 , was undersecretary of defense for policy in the George W. Bush administration.\par \par \uc2 (See related letters: "Letters to the Editor: Big Nuclear Arsenal, Smaller Chance of War" -- WSJ August 25, 2016)\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=wjco20160816000039"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document J000000020160816ec8g00012\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw272\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4080\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 In the midst of a deeply divisive presidential campaign, more than 1,000 psychiatrists declared the Republican candidate unfit for the office, citing severe personality defects, including paranoia, a grandiose manner and a Godlike self-image. One doctor called him ''a dangerous lunatic.''\par \par \uc2 The year was 1964, and after losing in a landslide, the candidate, Senator Barry Goldwater of Arizona, sued the publisher of Fact magazine, which had published the survey, winning $75,000 in damages.\par \par \uc2 But doctors attacked the survey, too, for its unsupported clinical language and obvious partisanship. In 1973, the \uc2 American Psychiatric Association\uc2  adopted what became known as the Goldwater Rule, declaring it unethical for any psychiatrist to diagnose a public figure's condition ''unless he or she has conducted an examination and has been granted proper authorization for such a statement.''\par \par \uc2 Enter \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 The 2016 Republican nominee's incendiary, stream-of-consciousness pronouncements have strained that agreement to the breaking point, exposing divisions in the field over whether such restraint is appropriate today.\par \par \uc2 Psychiatrists and psychologists have publicly flouted the Goldwater Rule, tagging Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  with an assortment of personality problems, including grandiosity, a lack of empathy, and ''malignant narcissism.'' The clinical insults are flying so thick that earlier this month, the psychiatric association posted a reminder that breaking the Goldwater Rule ''is irresponsible, potentially stigmatizing, and definitely unethical.''\par \par \uc2 Putting a psychiatric label on a candidate they oppose can be a ''seemingly irresistible tool for some in the field,'' said Dr. Paul Appelbaum, a professor of psychiatry, medicine and law at Columbia University who disapproves of the practice. ''This year, perhaps more than most, they're persuaded they're saving the nation from a terrible fate.''\par \par \uc2 William Doherty, a psychologist at the \uc2 University of Minnesota\uc2 , believes exactly that. In June, Dr. Doherty posted an online manifesto against ''Trumpism'' that has been signed by more than 2,200 mental health specialists.\par \par \uc2 ''Yes, for me this is an exception,'' Dr. Doherty said. ''What we have here is a threat to democracy itself.''\par \par \uc2 Supporters of the Goldwater Rule have cited three main rationales for adhering to it: Most diagnoses made from a distance turn out to be wrong; the labels themselves can cause real harm to the person and family members; and the practice undermines the field's credibility, particularly its commitment to confidentiality. Not to mention, others say, that it could expose a left-leaning bias in the field.\par \par \uc2 But the psychoanalyzing of public figures by commentators, columnists and pop psychologists has a bipartisan history. Concerns about grandiosity and narcissism dogged Lyndon B. Johnson's presidency. Suspicions of a deepening paranoia clouded the end of Richard Nixon's. Accusations of manipulation, deceit and a sense of entitlement have trailed the Clintons for years, prompting speculation about deeper personality problems.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  himself has recently tried to turn the tables, accusing \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  of being ''unstable'' and ''unhinged.''\par \par \uc2 While the vast majority of therapists' comments remain focused on Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , some in the profession say that if public psychoanalyzing is going to be done, it should be directed at both candidates.\par \par \uc2 ''Do those things rise to a diagnosable level? I sure don't know,'' said Don Sizemore, a family therapist in Lexington, Ky. ''But if we're diagnosing him, we should be doing the same for her.''\par \par \uc2 Yet history cautions against the armchair analysis of either one. Psychiatrists point to Goldwater himself as a prime example of getting it wrong. By the time he died in 1998, Mr. Goldwater was regarded as ''one of his party's most respected elder statesmen,'' The \uc2 Washington Post\uc2  said in its obituary.\par \par \uc2 In the wake of the Monica Lewinsky scandal, many people longed for a diagnosis to explain or denounce President \uc2 Bill \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's behavior, said Dr. Nada Stotland, a psychiatrist at Rush Medical College in Chicago. ''I remember getting all these media calls asking if he was a narcissist or a sex addict,'' she said. ''Well, sex addiction wasn't a recognized disorder at the time. And if it had been, was the behavior then not his fault? I ended up dancing around these questions, because this idea that we should go around, willy-nilly, putting diagnoses on people is just wrong.''\par \par \uc2 But those using clinical language to describe Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's behavior contend that this presidential \uc2 election\uc2  is vastly different, for a big reason: The proliferation of social media comments and video clips, which afford direct, unscripted access to candidates, was simply not available in previous races. The depth of that material creates a public persona complete enough to analyze on its own merits, they say.\par \par \uc2 Dr. Doherty said he and the therapists who signed his manifesto were not diagnosing Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's personal traits, but his public persona. The manifesto characterizes ''Trumpism'' as reinventing history, never apologizing, demeaning critics and inciting violence. ''One can talk about his public behavior without knowing whether he is fully that way with his children, his wife, his friends,'' Dr. Doherty said.\par \par \uc2 Dr. Steven Buser, a psychiatrist who with his colleague, Dr. Leonard Cruz, coedited a new book, ''A Clear and Present Danger: Narcissism in the Era of \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2 ,'' stressed, ''We are careful not to make a clinical diagnosis here, to say that \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  has narcissistic personality disorder.'' The contributing writers include psychiatrists and psychologists, but Dr. Buser said, ''We are focused on the image he projects, on TV, in tweets, in quotes.''\par \par \uc2 Dr. Appelbaum calls this distinction a convenient splitting of hairs. ''It takes a skilled therapist months, sometimes longer, seeing a person regularly and asking probing questions to make a determination of whether a disorder is present,'' Dr. Appelbaum said.\par \par \uc2 The stigma of mental vulnerability is especially damaging in politics. In the 1972 presidential race, Senator Thomas F. Eagleton of Missouri withdrew as George McGovern's running mate after 18 days -- at Mr. McGovern's request -- in the wake of revelations that he had undergone psychiatric counseling and electroshock therapy. In 1988, the Democratic nominee, Michael S. Dukakis, released his medical records to counter rumors that he had undergone psychiatric treatment. He had not.\par \par \uc2 During his libel trial, Mr. Goldwater was mystified by some of the psychiatrists' comments about his personality, including one calling him an ''anal character.'' ''I don't know what an anal character would be,'' he testified, according to news accounts. ''I tried to look it up in the dictionary, but couldn't find it.''\par \par \uc2 He took particular exception to a psychiatrist's comment that he was ''a counterfeit figure of a masculine man.'' Such a charge ''weighs several tons, and the effect is rather depressing,'' he said.\par \par \uc2 If there are exceptions to the Goldwater Rule, psychiatrists apparently cannot agree on them. More distant historical figures tend to be fair game; ''Lincoln's Melancholy,'' a book by Joshua Wolf Shenk making the case that Lincoln had suffered from depression, was well received.\par \par \uc2 Leaders of hostile nations may or may not qualify, depending on who is judging. A psychiatrist who provided a personality assessment of Saddam Hussein at the request of the George W. Bush administration was criticized by some in the psychiatric community, but not formally censured.\par \par \uc2 Retired politicians fall into a gray area. Therapists have penned books on George W. Bush, as well as \uc2 Bill \uc2 Clinton\uc2 . Not all of their colleagues approve.\par \par \uc2 But in an era when private moments and comments are increasingly available for public consumption, some argue that the Goldwater Rule is due for an update.\par \par \uc2 ''There's another perspective on this altogether,'' said John D. Mayer, a \uc2 University of New Hampshire\uc2  psychologist who has written widely on the rule. ''The ethicists who wrote the rule have been entirely focused on the negative side of commentaries. But there's a positive, adaptive side to every personality trait.\par \par \uc2 ''If you call someone deceitful, whether \uc2 Clinton\uc2  or \uc2 Trump\uc2 ,'' Dr. Mayer said of this year's nominees, ''it needs to be said that, for a good politician, there are reasons you can't always say everything you know, or exactly what you think.''\par \par \uc2 Find out what you need to know about the 2016 presidential race today, and get politics news updates via \uc2 Facebook\uc2 , \uc2 Twitter\uc2  and the First Draft newsletter.\par \par \uc2 Clockwise from above: Barry Goldwater, the 1964 presidential candidate who won damages over a published survey of psychiatrists; Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , who has been tagged with a variety of personality quirks; President Lyndon B. Johnson, who was labeled grandiose and narcissistic; and Thomas F. Eagleton, who withdrew as George McGovern's running mate in 1972 after revelations of his counseling and electroshock therapy.

Biden Jr\uc2 . warned on Monday that \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , even as a candidate, had elevated the dangers confronting American allies and military personnel overseas.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Biden said that on a trip to Kosovo and Serbia this week, he would be compelled to ''reassure'' allies that the United States would honor its commitment to \uc2 NATO\uc2 , given Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's comments saying he would reassess the arrangement if elected.\par \par \uc2 ''Because they're worried,'' Mr. Biden said, in his first campaign appearance beside \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 He added that if his son Beau, who died of brain cancer last year, were still serving in Iraq, he would advise him that the danger had increased ''a couple clicks'' because of Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's remarks, which have included the suggestion that President Obama was the ''founder'' of the Islamic State.\par \par \uc2 ''This guy's shame has no limits,'' he said.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Biden suggested Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  had demonstrated a fondness for brutal leaders like Saddam Hussein -- ''He would have loved Stalin,'' Mr. Biden said twice -- and repeatedly reminded the crowd of the stakes.\par \par \uc2 ''There's a guy that follows me, right back here, has the nuclear codes,'' Mr. Biden said at one point.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  is so reckless, the vice president said, that if his late son had planned to enlist in a \uc2 Trump\uc2  administration, ''I would have thrown my body in front of him.''\par \par \uc2 For Mr. Biden, after nearly eight years in the nation's chief supporting role, the appearance hinted at the niche he sees for himself as \uc2 Election\uc2  Day nears: a figure who can argue, plainly and personally, that Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  has already imperiled the nation he aspires to lead.\par \par \uc2 It was also a glimpse at the campaign that wasn't -- the earned folksiness, the willingness to test audience stamina, the years of practice at appearing unpracticed -- laying bare the strengths and tics of a would-be candidate who decided last year against challenging the woman he spent Monday embracing.\par \par \uc2 He mustered characteristic zeal to hold forth on American greatness and sacrifice. He interrupted himself at one point to wave to his family, arranging aloud for a future hug. He appeared to make an off-color joke about an old house of his in Scranton.\par \par \uc2 For much of the 34-minute performance -- with sleeves rolled slightly and any prepared text doomed to be ignored -- Mr. Biden assured his hometown's residents that Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  was ''made of the same stuff,'' even if she could not always show it.\par \par \uc2 ''Maybe the difference between the Irish Catholic and the Methodist,'' he wondered aloud, comparing himself to Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  from behind the vice-presidential seal. ''We wear everything on our sleeve!''\par \par \uc2 Since announcing in October that he would not seek the presidency, Mr. Biden has been a loyal Democratic lieutenant, taking care to praise Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  in public and rousing Democrats with a vintage address at the party's national convention last month.\par \par \uc2 But their decades-long relationship has more often been defined by an intense rivalry in private -- a predictable tension, perhaps, for two figures who have long imagined themselves in the nation's top job.\par \par \uc2 As he considered a run last year, still grieving his son's death, Mr. Biden felt slighted as the party establishment fell in line behind Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , viewing himself as the natural heir to President Obama's legacy.\par \par \uc2 In conversations with donors, Mr. Biden expressed astonishment at Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's handling of questions over her private email server. At times last year, people close to the vice president said, the mere mention of Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's name could make him fume.\par \par \uc2 ''They were professionals, but also competitors,'' William M. Daley, President Obama's former chief of staff, said of their time in the administration. ''They'd do the dance. There was respect there, but Joe considered himself the expert on foreign policy.''\par \par \uc2 Asked if largely watching the campaign from the sidelines had been hard for Mr. Biden, Mr. Daley said: ''Of course. He wanted to run.''\par \par \uc2 Yet in their first joint campaign appearance on Monday, in the city where both claim roots -- Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's father also grew up here, as she said at the outset -- any lingering rancor was well concealed.\par \par \uc2 They took the stage to Bruce Springsteen's ''The Rising,'' with Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  clapping the beat. Mr. Biden settled in a chair behind her, turning back to smile at the crowd.\par \par \uc2 Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  introduced him as ''a fighter for families'' and a passionate advocate. She said, if elected, she would ask Mr. Biden to continue to help lead a ''cancer moonshot'' initiative at the White House.\par \par \uc2 She even brandished a few retail politicking touches that Mr. Biden might appreciate, describing her own christening ''at the Methodist church on Court Street,'' recalling summer visits to Lake Winola and detailing her grandfather's time at the Scranton Lace mill.\par \par \uc2 She said her father had ''literally hopped a freight train from Scranton to Chicago'' to find work, deploying Mr. Biden's favorite adverb, if perhaps unwittingly.\par \par \uc2 She heaped praise on local officials, including ''your amazing Lackawanna County recorder of deeds,'' and spoke deferentially of her time in the ''Obama-Biden cabinet.''\par \par \uc2 And in an attack on Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  -- a speaker so formal that she often ignores contractions in prepared text to deliver them as two words -- set off on a down-home flourish of her own.\par \par \uc2 She was discussing Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's assertion that he provides child care services. In fact, Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  said, those benefits apply only to the pampered guests at some \uc2 Trump\uc2  properties -- not to his workers. ''Just sayin','' she added.\par \par \uc2 Repeatedly, the complex filled with chants for the two, with signs of ''Welcome home, Joe!'' or, simply, ''Joe'' shooting into view.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Biden, recalling weekly breakfasts with Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , described himself as her ''Obama whisperer.''\par \par \uc2 ''She'd look at me and say, 'What did he mean by that?''' Mr. Biden said, often clutching the lectern with two hands.\par \par \uc2 Often, Mr. Biden conspicuously interrupted himself, as if bantering with his own notes. ''I really mean this,'' he said. ''This is not a joke.''\par \par \uc2 But sometimes it was. Shortly after taking the stage, he meandered through an anecdote about a former home.\par \par \uc2 ''I was there when I was running, and up in the bedroom, written on the wall is one of those, '\uc2 Joe Biden\uc2  slept here,''' he said. ''Then it said, 'lived here.'''\par \par \uc2 He held for a beat: ''Glad they added the 'lived here' part.''\par \par \uc2 Chuckles filled the space, where Mr. Biden had appeared with Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  eight years earlier to campaign for President Obama.\par \par \uc2 For about 30 minutes, the people were rapt. Then a child cried audibly.\par \par \uc2 ''I am testing your stamina,'' Mr. Biden said, smiling once more. He wrapped up.\par \par \uc2 Find out what you need to know about the 2016 presidential race today, and get politics news updates via \uc2 Facebook\uc2 , \uc2 Twitter\uc2  and the First Draft newsletter.\par \par \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  said on Monday that if elected, she would ask Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. to continue his leadership of a ''cancer moonshot'' initiative.

\par\par \uc2 DEALBOOK\par \uc2 Business/Financial Desk; SECTB\par \b \uc2 An Olympic Event Where 1st Prize Is a Chance to Lose Billions\b0\par\par\uc2 By ANDREW ROSS SORKIN \par \uc2 1,349 \uc2 words\par \uc2 16 August 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 1\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 RIO DE JANEIRO -- Behind the scenes of the Olympic matchups and rivalries that draw large crowds here, there is stealth competition taking place in the hallways and hotels of this beach town worth tens of billions of dollars. It is a bidding war that could rival the most ferocious auction on Wall Street.\par \par \uc2 Armies of delegates from four cities -- led by a series of moguls, bankers, businessmen and government officials -- have been quietly battling one another here to court the leadership of the \uc2 International Olympic Committee\uc2  in hopes of being awarded the 2024 Summer Games. The delegates, representing Los Angeles, Paris, Rome and Budapest, have been scoping out the venues, receiving briefings on the massive security operation and taking meetings with just about anyone who can conceivably influence the outcome.\par \par \uc2 But these cities are all seeking to win a contest that for nearly the last three decades has been seemingly cursed. With few exceptions, the Games have cost the host cities billions. Rio is expected to spend at least $12 billion on the Games and to lose at least $4.6 billion, according to a study by Oxford. The last profitable Olympic Games, at least on paper, took place in 1984 in Los Angeles, and that might have been a historical anomaly. The 1976 Games in Montreal lost over $1 billion.\par \par \uc2 ''Hosting the Games has become an increasingly expensive gambit; indeed, as the rules for bidding currently stand, the entire structure of the Olympic Games shouts 'potential host beware,''' according to Robert A. Baade and Victor A. Matheson, sports economists who wrote a paper on the expense of hosting the Olympics.\par \par \uc2 What is it about the Olympics that causes some cities that are typically unwilling to spend a cent on infrastructure or planning to overspend so wildly? And is there a meaningful way to change the business model to rein in costs so that the Games can be both popular and profitable?\par \par \uc2 Those are the questions that the \uc2 International Olympic Committee\uc2  and the four cities competing to host the 2024 Games are trying to answer.\par \par \uc2 The Los Angeles delegation of some 25 people here is led by \uc2 Casey Wasserman\uc2 , the agency executive and grandson of the Hollywood mogul Lew Wasserman, as well as \uc2 Gene Sykes\uc2 , a longtime partner at \uc2 Goldman Sachs\uc2 , who has been behind some of the largest mergers and acquisitions of the last three decades. The Angelenos are making low cost (about $4.6 billion) and sustainability the cornerstones of their bid by proposing to use existing facilities like the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum, currently home to the Rams football team. According to their marketing material, ''L.A. 2024 is about what we have, not what we're going to build.''\par \par \uc2 Similarly, the Paris coalition's bid for the Games is based, in large part, on the infrastructure that the city already has; the Parisians estimate their cost would be about $7 billion, which is considered bargain-basement by Olympics standards.\par \par \uc2 But a bid by Rome, which hopes to follow a similar low-cost model, may already be in jeopardy: The city's new mayor, Virginia Raggi, has very publicly objected, saying that Rome's municipal deficit is too vast to consider hosting the Olympics. ''Historical data from the Olympics, discounting eventual episodes of corruption, shows us that the costs are not sustainable,'' she said in June. ''Other cities have already withdrawn their bids for these reasons. And I don't think they were thinking about corruption or Mafia infiltrations.'' She was probably referring to Boston, which last year ended its effort to host the 2024 Games over anxieties about the cost.\par \par \uc2 On the flip side, the mayor of Los Angeles, Eric Garcetti, who is here, made news when he hinted that the possibility of a Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2  presidency could make his city's bid less attractive. ''An America that turns inward, like any country that turns inward, isn't good for world peace, isn't good for progress, isn't good for all of us,'' he said, in the context of the factors that the \uc2 International Olympic Committee\uc2  might weigh. But he also said he didn't think the outcome of the American presidential \uc2 election\uc2  would affect the outcome of the committee's decision.\par \par \uc2 Whatever analyses have been done of the potential benefits and costs, they haven't dampened the zeal of the delegates in Rio: The competition to become the host city for 2024 has become so fierce that the committee issued a reprimand. ''Three 2024 Candidate Cities have contacted media and invited them to their hospitality houses here in Rio,'' the committee said in a statement. ''They have all been reminded that this was not permitted and have subsequently stopped their activities.''\par \par \uc2 Given the continuing concerns about costs and the burden that often falls to taxpayers, a larger question has emerged about whether the modern Olympics should continue to crisscross the globe as the multibillion-dollar lottery ticket it has become.\par \par \uc2 Christine Lagarde, managing director of the International Monetary Fund, has endorsed the view that the Olympics should be permanently located in Greece, its birthplace.\par \par \uc2 Others have suggested that the Olympics rotate among four of five permanent locations. Then there are more complicated ideas, including having a ''distributed'' Olympics that would take place at the same time in multiple cities, using existing stadiums and avoiding overwhelming any individual city.\par \par \uc2 But here's a thought: How about simultaneously granting a city the Olympics twice, once now and again 12 years later? That would allow the host city to enjoy the economic benefits of the Games twice, effectively bringing in double the revenue and amortizing the infrastructure costs over two events.\par \par \uc2 More important, it would force the cities to think long and hard about creating an infrastructure plan for the long term -- one that works not just for the Olympics but also for residents, who will have to live with what is left behind. And it would allow emerging cities to bid competitively on the Games against more established cities that might already have infrastructure in place. (One downside of the committee's current focus on lower costs is that potential new entrants could be eliminated from bidding to host the Games because the cost would invariably be so much higher.)\par \par \uc2 An alternative suggestion is that the committee grant a city the Olympics for two consecutive Games, but where's the fun in that? One of the great joys of the Olympics is the opportunity to be introduced -- or reintroduced -- to a city. Building in a 12-year gap would allow the spotlight to rotate among major global destinations, introducing them to younger spectators and making the cities feel fresh again to older ones. Such a plan would also create an even greater incentive for bidders to commit to investing in the Olympics, and would weed out cities and countries that are unwilling to do so.\par \par \uc2 In fairness, hosting the Olympic Games can clearly put a city on the map; it is the ultimate marketing tool. Locals can often benefit, too, from infrastructure improvements and increased tourism. But it will always be hard to make the math work for fiscal disciplinarians. There's got to be a better way.\par \par \uc2 The opening ceremony of the 1984 Summer Games in Los Angeles, perhaps the last time the event was profitable.

\par\par \uc2 ANOTHER VIEW\par \uc2 Business/Financial Desk; SECT\par \b \uc2 The Risks of Unfettered Capitalism\b0\par\par\uc2 By JEFF SOVERN \par \uc2 761 \uc2 words\par \uc2 16 August 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 The New York Times on the Web\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Capitalism may be the best economic system ever devised, but one of its drawbacks is that it provides financial incentives to harm and even kill people. Just ask those people who say they have been victimized by cigarettes, predatory lenders, \uc2 Volkswagen\uc2  diesel emissions, Takata airbags, \uc2 General Motors\uc2  ignition switches, \uc2 Trump\uc2  University, Vioxx, asbestos or other products.\par \par \uc2 With some of those examples, providers knew of problems long before they were disclosed but kept selling their wares, sometimes even covering up problems, all for profit.\par \par \uc2 Our economic system uses three main mechanisms to rein in misbehaving companies. One is that businesses themselves may eschew dangerous choices, either because of their decision-makers' consciences or out of self-interest, because they fear that their reputation -- and therefore, sales -- would be injured by damaging disclosures. But businesses also face countervailing pressure to generate profits. If competitors get away with cutting corners, more ethical companies that incur higher costs and so must charge higher prices may lose market share. As a result, companies may feel pushed to make choices that impose risks on consumers.\par \par \uc2 Another check on business misconduct is consumers themselves. Consumers can choose not to buy dangerous products, and declining cigarette sales indicate that many have.\par \par \uc2 But while consumer decision-making can be a potent restraint on matters consumers pay attention to -- like price -- consumers can't protect themselves against hazards they don't know about. Sometimes consumers can't understand the risks of their conduct, which may help explain why so many consumers lost their homes in the subprime crisis. Other times companies conceal their misconduct, as \uc2 Volkswagen\uc2  did with diesel emissions. Or companies may create enough doubt that consumers can't determine the truth, as tobacco companies did with the health dangers of smoking. Consumers who want to continue enjoying a product may choose to believe the company so they can continue doing so. Many smokers did just that.\par \par \uc2 The third protection is regulation. Lawmakers can study problems and require businesses to protect consumers against risks that ordinary people might not anticipate. For example, consumers getting credit cards need not master the meaning of universal default or double-cycle billing because Congress has forbidden credit card companies from employing those methods.\par \par \uc2 But regulation is under constant attack. The Republican Party platform proposes a ''regulatory budget'' that would limit the costs regulation can impose on the economy. Many of the attacks take place outside consumers' view, in arcane congressional bills or when bank lobbyists are named to head government agencies. But though out of sight might mean out of mind, it doesn't mean nonexistent.\par \par \uc2 One problem with regulation is that often the people who benefit from it -- consumers -- are not the people who feel most keenly the burdens it imposes. The businesses that must comply with regulations no longer make the money they once made from selling injurious products. Even if their products did not cause problems, they may now have to spend money complying with regulations. Consequently, many businesses and their lobbyists fight hard against regulation. They argue that regulation raises prices and restricts access to things consumers would otherwise have. Sometimes, that is so. But other times it isn't, and even when it is, society is sometimes better off as a result.\par \par \uc2 Critics of regulation don't just attack its costs. They also ask who is better able to protect your family: you or a government employee. Perhaps the people who lost their homes because of predatory lending would have been better off if policy makers had decided earlier that sometimes the answer is a bureaucrat.\par \par \uc2 The more we discard regulation, the more consumers must depend on companies to protect us from risks from their products that consumers cannot readily understand or don't have time to study. And as the examples above indicate, companies sometimes succumb to the incentive to dispense with that protection.\par \par \uc2 Many voters will base their decision in this year's \uc2 election\uc2  on the character of the candidates, or other issues, like immigration or foreign policy. But how we protect people though regulation is also very much on the ballot. When you hear complaints about too much regulation, don't forget to ask what harm that regulation may prevent. Capitalism lifts standards of living -- but regulated capitalism keeps us well enough to enjoy a higher standard of living.\par \par \uc2 Jeff Sovern is a professor of law at St. John's University School of Law and co-coordinator of the Consumer Law and Policy Blog.\par \par \uc2 Document NYTF000020160816ec8g00049\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw272\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4080\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 Hundreds of people gathered in a Brooklyn parking lot Monday to offer prayers for an imam and his friend who were gunned down near a mosque over the weekend.\par \par \uc2 Leaders of the Bangladeshi Muslim community in Queens, where the men lived, also called for increased police protection following the killings.\par \par \uc2 Imam Maulana Akonjee, 55 years old, and Thara Uddin, 64, were shot following a prayer service at a mosque where Mr. Akonjee, an immigrant from Bangladesh, was a regular speaker.\par \par \uc2 On Monday night, the \uc2 New York Police Department\uc2  charged a 35-year-old man with two counts of murder in the attack, which occurred Saturday at 79th Street and Liberty Avenue in the Ozone Park neighborhood of Queens.\par \par \uc2 Many at the prayer service blamed the attack on a climate of religious intolerance they say was created by the presidential \uc2 election\uc2 . Republican nominee \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  has called for tight restrictions on Muslim immigration.\par \par \uc2 Anwar Khan, a teacher, read a statement on behalf of the victims' families and the local Muslim community. He said the killings were a "terrorist act committed by an individual motivated by hatred towards them."\par \par \uc2 Mayor \uc2 Bill de Blasio\uc2  promised Muslim New Yorkers would be protected.\par \par \uc2 "We will get justice for this community," Mr. de Blasio said to cheers.\par \par \uc2 Facing east under a scorching sun, men formed into rows for standing prayers to close the service. Two hearses then rolled out into the street.\par \par \uc2 Asm Rahman, 60, an accountant from Elmhurst, Queens, said the attack has frightened the local Muslim community.\par \par \uc2 "I came because Muslim lives matter to me. They're very innocent people, very pious," he said. "There's no reason to die like this. . .We feel a little unsafe."\par \par \uc2 Mr. Rahman said children in the community ask, " 'Why we are being subject to hate?' And we don't have any answers."\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=wjco20160816000083"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document J000000020160816ec8g0002a\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw272\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4080\pichgoal600

\par\par \b \uc2 City News: To Endorse or Not to Endorse? \uc2 Trump\uc2  Splinters Yale Republican Club\b0\par\par\uc2 By Mike Vilensky   \par \uc2 526 \uc2 words\par \uc2 16 August 2016\par \uc2 The Wall Street Journal\par \uc2 J\par A15\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2 's presidential candidacy has riven \uc2 Yale University\uc2 's young Republicans.\par \par \uc2 Earlier this month, four of the seven student board members of the Yale College Republicans resigned in protest when the club endorsed Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Those four have since formed a rival Republican faction, the Yale New Republicans, which plans to discuss its own endorsement when students return to campus.\par \par \uc2 "We believe that if a Republican candidate strays so far from Republican values, that we shouldn't have to support him or her simply because they are a Republican," said Michael Fitzgerald, a 19-year-old sophomore who is the co-chairman of the Yale New Republicans and former treasurer of the Yale College Republicans.\par \par \uc2 The resignations were reported earlier by the Yale Daily News.\par \par \uc2 Emily Reinwald and Michaela Cloutier, co-presidents of the Yale College Republicans, said in an email that they would replace the leaders who resigned and defended the club's decision to endorse Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 The constitution of the club, they said, says that its purpose is to " 'aid in the \uc2 election\uc2  of Republican candidates at all levels of government.' Our party nominated \uc2 Trump\uc2 , and thus our organization remains a resource for any Yale student who would like to learn more about the Republican Party and all of our candidates."\par \par \uc2 The Yale College Republicans' endorsement was prompted by social-media activity that confused some students.\par \par \uc2 On Aug. 8, a \uc2 Twitter\uc2  account called YaleRepublicans posted that the club wouldn't be supporting Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  in November. Yale College Republicans leaders said the tweet was a hoax and that the account, since deleted, wasn't affiliated with them.\par \par \uc2 Later that day, hoping to keep wrong information from circulating, Ms. Reinwald, a 21-year-old senior, and Ms. Cloutier, a 20-year-old junior, decided to announce that the group did indeed back Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 "While not every member of our organization supported \uc2 Trump\uc2  in the primary, as an organization and branch of the GOP, we support Republicans up and down the ballot," they wrote in a \uc2 Facebook\uc2  post. "And yes, that includes supporting \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  for president."\par \par \uc2 The endorsement came a few days after another Ivy League school's GOP group, the Harvard Republican Club, said it wouldn't back Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 At Yale, opposition to the New York businessman's candidacy has resulted in more than one new group. Also this month, Yale senior Alexander Michaud and other students formed the Yale Undergraduate Conservatives Against \uc2 Trump\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Mr. Michaud is part of the Party of the Right, a conservative and libertarian-leaning campus organization that hasn't endorsed anyone in the presidential race. He said he couldn't "in good conscience, passively condone" Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's candidacy.\par \par \uc2 A spokeswoman for Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  didn't respond to requests for comment.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  has a handful of enthusiastic supporters at Yale.\par \par \uc2 Karina Kovalcik, a senior who said she plans to vote for Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  in November, shrugged off the infighting.\par \par \uc2 "Yale students will make a controversy out of anything," she said.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=wjco20160816000073"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document J000000020160816ec8g00020\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw272\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4080\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 WASHINGTON -- The \uc2 Federal Bureau of Investigation\uc2  is preparing to hand over to Congress interview notes from its probe of \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's emails, as well as a summary of the evidence uncovered by its agents, according to people familiar with the decision.\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 FBI\uc2  and the State Department are currently discussing which portions of the agents' summary of their July 2 interview with Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  can be handed over to lawmakers, these people said.\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 FBI\uc2  is planning to turn over the summaries of interviews with other \uc2 Clinton\uc2  aides, these people said. Other investigative material also will likely be turned over, including the \uc2 FBI\uc2 's broader summary of the facts of the investigation, as well as copies of the 110 emails that contained information that was classified at the time they were sent. There could be significant redactions in the material to be provided to lawmakers as classified information, they said.\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 FBI\uc2  launched an inquiry to see if classified data was criminally mishandled through Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's use of private email while she was secretary of state. That probe ended last month, when FBI Director James Comey said he wouldn't recommend criminal charges, though he said investigators had found "extremely careless" behavior.\par \par \uc2 The sharing of investigative details from the \uc2 FBI\uc2  increases the likelihood that Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's email scandal will remain an issue in the presidential campaign. Polls show Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  with a widening lead over Republican \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 House Republicans had asked the \uc2 FBI\uc2  to provide the documents, in part because they claim Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  lied about her use of the private email and the extent to which that put classified data at risk.\par \par \uc2 Two senior Republicans renewed calls Monday for federal prosecutors to pursue a perjury case against Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  for statements she made to Congress. In a letter, Reps. Jason Chaffetz (R., Utah) and Bob Goodlatte (R., Va.) identified four instances in which they said Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's hearing testimony was contradicted by the \uc2 FBI\uc2 's findings.\par \par \uc2 At a campaign event last week, former President \uc2 Bill \uc2 Clinton\uc2  defended his wife, saying the accusation that she received information marked classified "is the biggest load of bull I've ever heard."\par \par \uc2 Mr. Comey has said Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  was truthful in her private interview with agents, but has declined to address whether she was honest in her public statements.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=wjco20160816000064"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document J000000020160816ec8g0001r\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw272\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4080\pichgoal600

\par\par \b \uc2 Election\uc2  2016 --- CAPITAL JOURNAL: \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's Test: Energy on Left, Opening on Right\b0\par\par\uc2 By Gerald F. Seib   \par \uc2 845 \uc2 words\par \uc2 16 August 2016\par \uc2 The Wall Street Journal\par \uc2 J\par A4\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  is in an enviable position. And a tough one, too.\par \par \uc2 By every metric possible, she is leading in the presidential race, and comfortably. She privately tells associates she expects the race against \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  to tighten, but for now every national poll and every battleground state poll tells the same upbeat story for her.\par \par \uc2 Yet she also is caught in a kind of political and ideological no-woman's land. The energy in her Democratic Party is all on the left, where suspicions of her moderate instincts still run high. Meanwhile, the historic opening Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  is presenting her is on her right, among independents and moderate Republicans who don't want to be part of the angry populist version of the GOP that he is leading.\par \par \uc2 As that suggests, there now are in a sense three political parties in the U.S.: The Bernie Sanders/Elizabeth Warren liberals; the \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  angry populists; and the socially liberal, fiscally conservative centrists searching for a place to go. (Ideological conservatives are the odd folks out right now, left to either make their peace with the \uc2 Trump\uc2  version of the Republican or hope they can get the party back when he is done using it.)\par \par \uc2 Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  is trying to draw from all three streams. That is, she seeks to placate her own party's liberals, to pull back some of those traditionally Democratic white working-class males tempted to defect to Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , and to woo moderate Republicans now willing to jump ship.\par \par \uc2 Doing all those things at once is a tough assignment. Thus Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  is running a television ad that starts with her pledge to raise taxes on the wealthiest Americans and to impose a new tax on companies who move their headquarters abroad, which pleases the left and the populists. It then suggests she will spend all that money on big new infrastructure projects. That is pleasing to both business interests who want the nation's transportation and communications networks upgraded, as well as working-class Americans who stand to get the jobs needed to make the improvements.\par \par \uc2 Similarly, she has moved toward Mr. Sanders on the question of college costs, offering a plan that would use government aid to make college tuition-free for students from families making $85,000 a year or less. In a nod to the left, that is a step toward the college free-for-all idea Mr. Sanders was promoting. But in a nod to the center, it is less than the bonanza Mr. Sanders was offering.\par \par \uc2 The fiscally responsible part of Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  worries about how to pay for even that slimmed-down college plan -- while some in her party tell her not to bother worrying about that. If neither Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  nor Mr. Sanders tried to make the numbers add up in their economic plans, they argue, why should she?\par \par \uc2 And on national-security matters, Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  continues promising, or at least hinting, that she will be tougher than President \uc2 Barack Obama\uc2  has been. Her website speaks of "intensifying" the air campaign against Islamic State forces in Iraq and Syria. And, in a slap at Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's friendly nods toward Russia's leader, she says she will "stand up" to \uc2 Vladimir Putin\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Those promises are what you'd expect from a former secretary of state who has consistently shown a hawkish side that puts her somewhere in a center-right spot on the national-security spectrum. It is a position that is comfortable for moderates, yet matches neither Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's nationalist promises to pull back from commitments to alliances abroad, nor the wishes of those liberals who booed and chanted "no more war" as former Defense Secretary and Central Intelligence Agency chief \uc2 Leon Panetta\uc2  spoke at the Democratic National Convention.\par \par \uc2 Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  stands in the midst of these big forces. Part of her predicament was captured humorously in a weekend show by Chicago's famed Second City comedy troupe, during which a series of actors portraying Sanders voters filed onto stage and one by one painfully sought to say, after stammering and mumbling around, that they were sort of, kind of, well, probably going to vote for Hillary.\par \par \uc2 Juxtaposed against that bloc of reluctant Sanders voters is the historic opportunity for Democrats to claim some significant real estate in the political center thanks to Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's weakness there.\par \par \uc2 This situation tells us two big things about the future. First, even if Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  wins, governing won't be easy, because all these disparate strands will be on display in a new Congress next year.\par \par \uc2 And second, regardless of the precise outcome of this year's presidential \uc2 election\uc2 , a realignment of the two major political parties is under way. We are in an odd situation in which neither presidential candidate is in full control of his or her party. Instead, a great sorting out has begun.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=wjco20160816000063"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document J000000020160816ec8g0001q\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw272\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4080\pichgoal600

\par\par \b \uc2 Election\uc2  2016: Manafort's Ukraine Role Surfaces in Race\b0\par\par\uc2 By James Marson in Kiev, Ukraine, and Damian Paletta in Washington   \par \uc2 731 \uc2 words\par \uc2 16 August 2016\par \uc2 The Wall Street Journal\par \uc2 J\par A4\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 Before Republican \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  picked him to direct his run at the White House, \uc2 Paul Manafort\uc2 's last high-profile client was former Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych, a tainted candidate whom Mr. Manafort helped transform into a winning one -- for a time.\par \par \uc2 In Ukraine, Mr. Manafort navigated around the egos of tycoons and politicians; he hammered out a message that was part economic, part tribal; and he shepherded campaigns through rocky times.\par \par \uc2 For Mr. Manafort's allies, his work with Mr. Yanukovych is evidence of his steady hand and skill under pressure: He revived a candidate who had lost a disputed \uc2 election\uc2  in 2004, defeating a political rival, Yulia Tymoshenko, known as a fearsome campaigner.\par \par \uc2 For his detractors, the harsh nature of Mr. Yanukovych's rule reveals Mr. Manafort, 67 years old, as a gun-for-hire focused solely on winning -- and with no compunction about the nature of his client.\par \par \uc2 "Manafort was representing a guy who was up to his eyeballs in corruption and has blood on his hands," said David Kramer, senior director for human rights and democracy at the McCain Institute and a former U.S. assistant secretary of state under George W. Bush.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Manafort's Ukraine work has become an issue for him and the \uc2 Trump\uc2  campaign, for which he serves as chairman. Following a report in the \uc2 New York Times\uc2 , Ukraine's top anticorruption prosecutor said Monday Mr. Manafort's name was in secret records of off-the-books payments made by Mr. Yanukovych's pro-Russian Party of Regions from 2007 to 2012, and that investigators are looking into the ledger. The prosecutor, Artem Sytnyk, said that didn't mean that Mr. Manafort necessarily received any money.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Manafort, in an email Monday, said he has "no knowledge of any ledger or payments."\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 Clinton\uc2  campaign has pounced on Mr. Manafort's work in the Ukraine. Mr. Yanukovych is now in exile in Russia after fleeing mass protests in Kiev in 2014. GOP candidates and lawmakers are typically much more adversarial with Russian President \uc2 Vladimir Putin\uc2 , but Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  has vowed to try and work with Russia on a range of issues.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Yanukovych was an unsophisticated politician with rough edges. Twice jailed for assault and theft in his youth, he was a leaden speaker. But he was willing to be coached.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Manafort was initially hired in 2005 by metals-and-coal tycoon Rinat Akhmetov and tasked with reviving the Party of Regions. Mr. Yanukovych, the party's leader, was at a low point. He had declared victory, supported by Russia, in a fraud-tainted presidential ballot in 2004 that was opposed by mass street protests, known as the Orange Revolution, in favor of a U.S.-backed candidate. He lost a re-run.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Manafort rallied the disparate factions around Mr. Yanukovych, allies say. "He was able to have equal relations with all the people around Yanukovych. He was able to unite groups," said Hanna Herman, then a close adviser to Mr. Yanukovych.\par \par \uc2 The party won 32% of the vote in parliamentary elections in 2006, and Mr. Yanukovych became prime minister.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Manafort's greatest victory in Ukraine came in the presidential \uc2 election\uc2  in 2010.\par \par \uc2 The circumstances were favorable: The leaders of the 2004 Orange Revolution, Ms. Tymoshenko and President Viktor Yushchenko, had turned on each other. Ms. Tymoshenko, the prime minister, was battling a 15% drop in economic output in 2009.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Manafort's team held frequent strategy meetings to draw up weekly talking points for Mr. Yanukovych, using polling to focus the message and geography of the campaign.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Manafort forged a personal relationship with Mr. Yanukovych, spending hours working with him and playing tennis at his mansion outside Kiev, allies of both men recall. Mr. Yanukovych became a disciplined candidate who stuck to talking points, allies say.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Manafort said in the email that accounts of his spending many hours with Mr. Yanukovych were "an exaggeration and not true."\par \par \uc2 But once in power, Mr. Yanukovych quickly went off script: Ms. Tymoshenko was jailed, and corruption flourished. In February 2014, after dozens had been killed in clashes between protesters and police, he fled to Russia.\par \par \uc2 ---\par \par \uc2 Reid J.

Why should I have all the fun?"\par \par \uc2 'The Price' is Right\par \par \uc2 For Star-Filled Cast\par \par \uc2 John Turturro is returning to Broadway to star in \uc2 Roundabout Theatre Company\uc2 's new production of Arthur Miller's 1968 play "The Price" at the American Airlines Theatre.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Turturro will take on the role of Victor Franz, a cop forced to confront his youthful sacrifices as he sells off his parents' furniture and deals with the past. He will be joined by Jessica Hecht, as his wife Esther, and Tony Shalhoub, playing his estranged brother. Previews begin Feb. 16. \uc2 Terry Kinney\uc2  directs.\par \par \uc2 Family Fare Tops\par \par \uc2 Weekly Box Office\par \par \uc2 Family-friendly shows dominated the summertime box office last week, with "The Lion King" grossing $2.3 million, "Wicked" bringing in $1.7 million and "Cats" collecting $1.1 million, according to data provided by the Broadway League.\par \par \uc2 Meanwhile, the Blake family Thanksgiving dinner is onstage again as "The Humans" reopened on Aug. 9 after moving to the Gerald Schoenfeld Theatre from the \uc2 Helen Hayes\uc2 . In its first week of eight shows in the new house, "The Humans" grossed $603,770, or 62% of its weekly potential.\par \par \uc2 Another family is just four weeks from moving out: "Fun Home" is to close on Sept. 10, but the neighbors don't seem to be stopping in for farewells just yet. The intimate musical grossed $379, 242 last week, or 48% of its potential, virtually the same as the week before.\par \par \uc2 Chita Rivera, at 83,\par \par \uc2 Conquers Carnegie\par \par \uc2 How do you get to Carnegie Hall? It helps to be continuously fabulous for decades, a la Chita Rivera, who will take the stage Nov. 7 for the first time as a headliner.\par \par \uc2 "I think it's time to give the lady her due," said the show's producer, Daniel Nardicio.\par \par \uc2 A 15-piece band, plus dancers, will be backing up this Tony Award-winning triple-threat performer, making the night significantly different from Ms. Rivera's cabaret act at the Cafe Carlyle.\par \par \uc2 She will also be accompanied by some leading men, including Alan Cumming, Andy Karl and more to be announced, said Mr. Nardicio, who also produced Mr. Cumming's sold-out Carnegie Hall show.\par \par \uc2 Broadway Relocates\par \par \uc2 To New York Harbor\par \par \uc2 A who's who of Broadway set sail last week for Ellis Island, where a concert version of the musical "Ragtime" took place in the historic Registry Room. Among the crowd of 450 were the show's lyricist Lynn Ahrens and its original Tateh, Peter Friedman, as well as Broadway producers Tom Kirdahy and Hal Luftig.\par \par \uc2 Talks are starting this week to determine if a long-running show or another one-off, possibly televised, would work best, said director Sammi Cannold. Among the challenges, she said, was the sound design in the large, tiled room, but fixes have been floated: "What if the vocals were live but pumped into headphones?"\par \par \uc2 ---\par \par \uc2 Compiled by Pia Catton\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=wjco20160816000055"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document J000000020160816ec8g0001i\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw272\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4080\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 Real Clear Politics Washington Bureau Chief Carl Cannon writing Aug. 15:\par \par \uc2 For years after President Nixon resigned in scandal, journalists in the nation's capital would receive anonymous phone calls from conspiracy buffs who fashioned themselves as another Deep Throat. It was always a version of the same story: They had the goods on a scandal bigger than Watergate.\par \par \uc2 As a well-known White House correspondent at The Washington Post, the newspaper that uncovered many of the abuses that drove Nixon from office, my father, Lou Cannon, received his share of such calls. In response to these crackpots, Dad espoused a simple rule: "If they say, 'I've got a story that will make Watergate look like a picnic,' I hang up on 'em."\par \par \uc2 Far be it from me to suggest that \uc2 Nancy Pelosi\uc2  and the Democratic Party leadership have gone off their collective rocker. But using the Russians as foils to deflect attention from the embarrassing content of hacked Democrats' emails was bad enough even before Pelosi played the Watergate card. But the 2016 presidential campaign has now officially entered the silly season. . . .\par \par \uc2 Her goal is to inoculate \uc2 Clinton\uc2  against damaging revelations in the release of future hacked material. She did so by tainting the source. Yes, the Watergate analogy is a stretch: Although the 1972 burglary did target \uc2 Democratic National Committee\uc2  headquarters, it wasn't done by a foreign power, it was carried out on the orders of President Nixon's re-\uc2 election\uc2  committee. It would be as if \uc2 Trump\uc2  or [RNC Chairman Reince] Priebus ordered the DNC hacking. Then again, MSNBC floated this very idea when the scandal first broke.\par \par \uc2 "Why weren't you guys hacked?" one MSNBC anchor asked Priebus, as though that was evidence of Republican collusion with the Ruskies.\par \par \uc2 The moral of the episode is that Team \uc2 Clinton\uc2  is clever, the media compliant, and \uc2 Trump\uc2  clueless. But what kind of conspiracy theory is that? I think I'll call my dad with an anonymous tip. I've got a story that will make Deep Throat look like a piker: \uc2 Trump\uc2  is a \uc2 Clinton\uc2  mole.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=wjco20160816000036"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document J000000020160816ec8g0000z\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw272\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4080\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 The public mood isn't especially buoyant, and neither is confidence in U.S. institutions, though there is one notable exception: American business. On Monday Gallup published its annual poll of public views on various industries, and most continue to have positive and durable reputations despite \uc2 election\uc2 -years attacks from \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  and \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Across the 25 areas that Gallup surveyed, the restaurant and computer industries were the most popular by far, and maybe it's no coincidence that these are among the most competitive U.S. markets. Only 7% viewed the food and beverage business unfavorably, 66% favorably, for a net rating of +59 points, while tech was close behind at +53. Another seven industries, like groceries, retail and farming, had net ratings above +20 or +30.\par \par \uc2 Another 10 industries have images that are solid or near neutral, including some favorite political targets like banking and finance (+2) and electric and gas utilities (+9). Even airlines, in this summer of security limbo, congestion and delays, shook out at +15. So did telecom.\par \par \uc2 The exceptions are the five industries that Gallup found are viewed more negatively than positively on net: oil and gas (minus-7), lawyers (minus-8), health care (minus-20) and pharmaceuticals (minus-23). Public opinion for health care has plunged to a five-year low, which also corresponds to its rough annexation by the federal government under ObamaCare.\par \par \uc2 Speaking of which, the worst performer in the Gallup survey? None other than the federal government, with merely 28% expressing a positive view and 55% a negative one for a net rating of minus-27 points. The pollster reports that "trust in the government's ability to handle domestic problems has never been lower in Gallup's trends, which stretch back to the 1970s."\par \par \uc2 Trust in government tends to expand and contract in inverse proportion to Washington's ambition, so one of President Obama's legacies will be to erode faith in the central planning he so reveres. The Gallup report shows that Americans are more invested in the resilient private economy than in their public leaders.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=wjco20160816000028"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document J000000020160816ec8g0000r\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw272\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4080\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 REVIEW & OUTLOOK (Editorial)\par \b \uc2 Trump\uc2 's Anti-Terror Strategy\b0\par\par\uc2 863 \uc2 words\par \uc2 16 August 2016\par \uc2 The Wall Street Journal\par \uc2 J\par A10\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  made another pivot back to the issues on Monday, this time laying out his strategy to fight radical Islam. As usual it included some good ideas and some bad, but if we're lucky he'll stick with the subject long enough to force \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  to debate something other than his temperament.\par \par \uc2 The polls show Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  still has a slight edge over the Democrat in fighting terror, thanks in large part to President Obama's eight-year record. Islamic State incubated in the vacuum left by American retreat in Iraq and Syria, and its poison has spread throughout the world. Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  is promising to continue Mr. Obama's strategy, which gives the Republican an opening.\par \par \uc2 "The failure to establish a new Status of Forces Agreement in Iraq, and the \uc2 election\uc2 -driven timetable for withdrawal, surrendered our gains in that country and led directly to the rise of ISIS," Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  said as he read from a prepared text in Youngstown, Ohio. That's exactly right, though he should have added Mr. Obama's decision to let the Syrian civil war rage out of control.\par \par \uc2 Then again, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  has sometimes said the U.S. should stay out of Syria's civil war because it amounts to the "nation-building" that Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  again promised to end. That's a good applause line on the right and left these days, but setting up safe zones in Syria so millions of refugees won't flood Turkey, Jordan and Europe is a long way from nation-building. The U.S. did that for the Kurds after the first Gulf War, and the Kurdish territory of Iraq is a rare American success in the Middle East.\par \par \uc2 If Mr. Obama had kept 10,000 U.S. troops in Iraq after 2011, the critics might have called that nation-building too. But it would have blocked the march of Islamic State and spared us from having to refight the war in Iraq today. Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's caricature of nation-building is closer to \uc2 Barack Obama\uc2 's view than he would like to admit.\par \par \uc2 The better news is that Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  seems to be warming to the idea that the U.S. needs coalitions to defeat radical Islam. Most notably, he reversed course on \uc2 NATO\uc2  in his speech, praising its role in fighting terrorism. He also called for "an international conference" on fighting radical Islam and he cited Israel, Egypt and Jordan as particular allies in the fight.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  still seems naive in expecting \uc2 Vladimir Putin\uc2 's Russia to assist in this effort, but then so were Mr. Obama and Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  in 2009. Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  hasn't seemed to notice that Mr. Obama recently agreed to share intelligence with Russia in Syria over the vociferous objections of the Pentagon. The Republican nominee would have to learn the hard way that Mr. Putin is a hard man who only responds to the logic of hard geopolitical facts.\par \par \uc2 More welcome is Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's promise to conduct "ideological warfare" against Islamic State, making the analogy to the way Ronald Reagan told the truth about "the evil empire" during the Cold War. He said this will mean speaking out "against the oppression of women, gays and people of different faith" in the Muslim world.\par \par \uc2 Perhaps most encouraging was his pledge that "our Administration will be a friend to all moderate Muslim reformers in the Middle East, and will amplify their voices." This may seem obvious, but Mr. Obama has preferred to play down divisions in the Islamic world lest he offend the Muslim leaders he has courted in Turkey and Iran. Islamic State must be defeated on the battlefield, but it's good to see Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  recognize that the West needs to win the battle of ideas too.\par \par \uc2 Yet on this point he contradicts his strategy by proposing a total ban on immigration from countries "that have a history of exporting terrorism." Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  calls it a "temporary" suspension until new screening procedures can be established. But he isn't clear when or how the ban would be lifted. No screening is fool-proof, and pledges of loyalty or other ideological tests can be gamed.\par \par \uc2 The sweeping immigration ban might be read as anti-Muslim by the same allies Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  says we need to defeat Islamic State. Its breadth would also presumably apply to Coptic Christians in Egypt or Syria, Iraqi translators who helped U.S. troops, and perhaps even Israelis since some Israeli Arabs practice terrorism. Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  is right that Mr. Obama fails to stigmatize radical Islam, but then the Republican shouldn't stigmatize all refugees as potential security risks.\par \par \uc2 The best message of the speech is that it means we might get a national-security debate this \uc2 election\uc2  year. The \uc2 Clinton\uc2  campaign is hoping to disqualify Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  as a potential President without having to confront the issues or her record as Secretary of State. Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  has trouble sticking to a message, but this is a debate the American public needs to hear.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=wjco20160816000027"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document J000000020160816ec8g0000q\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw272\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4080\pichgoal600

\par\par \b \uc2 The Cure for Wage Stagnation\b0\par\par\uc2 By Kevin A. Hassett and Aparna Mathur   \par \uc2 1,095 \uc2 words\par \uc2 15 August 2016\par \uc2 The Wall Street Journal\par \uc2 J\par A11\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 The populist anger of this \uc2 election\uc2  cycle stems, at least in part, from consistently bad economic news. While the overall U.S. economy has been inching forward, most peoples' lives have barely been improving at all. The average hourly wage for manufacturing workers was $20.83 in June 2006, in current dollars, according to \uc2 Bureau of Labor Statistics\uc2  data. Adjusted for inflation, it is only about a dollar higher today.\par \par \uc2 The dissatisfaction of working-class voters in both parties is understandable. Yet this presents a once in a lifetime policy opportunity. If the next president has a plan to increase wages that is based on well-documented and widely accepted empirical evidence, he should have little trouble finding bipartisan support. If politicians in Washington oppose the president's ideas, he can, as Ronald Reagan did, go over their heads to the outraged voters.\par \par \uc2 Fortunately, such a plan exists. Regardless of who is elected in November, workers from both parties should unite and demand a cut in corporate tax rates. The economic theory behind this proposition is uncontroversial. More productive workers earn higher wages. Workers become more productive when they acquire better skills or have better tools. Lower corporate rates create the right incentives for firms to give workers better tools.\par \par \uc2 Leaders from both parties have proposed lowering America's 35% corporate tax rate, the highest in the developed world. President Obama has called for cutting it to 28% (25% for manufacturers), while \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  proposes 15%. \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  is the outlier. To the detriment of her working-class supporters, she has failed to back even a minor cut to corporate taxes.\par \par \uc2 What proof is there that lower corporate rates equal higher wages? Quite a lot. In 2006 we co-wrote the first empirical study on the direct link between corporate taxes and manufacturing wages. Our approach was highly intuitive and drew on a large literature exploring who really pays the taxes that government collects.\par \par \uc2 Back then it was widely accepted, for example, that sales taxes are not necessarily paid by consumers. If the government charges a 10% sales tax, goods prices might go up 10%, in which case consumers would pay the whole tax. On the other hand, goods prices might go up by less than 10%, in which case the retailer would have smaller profits. Processing massive quantities of data, economists found by the early 2000s that prices tend to go up about one for one with sales taxes. Sales taxes are thus borne mostly by consumers, not firms.\par \par \uc2 We applied a similar method to study the impact of corporate taxation on the wages of blue-collar workers. If a higher corporate tax reduces the return to capital, then capital may move abroad. This outflow could reduce the productivity and compensation for domestic workers, who are relatively immobile. So just as a sales tax might have an impact on the final goods price, a higher corporate tax might have an impact on wages. If wages go down when corporate taxes go up, the worker is left holding the tax bag.\par \par \uc2 Our empirical analysis, which used data we gathered on international tax rates and manufacturing wages in 72 countries over 22 years, confirmed that the corporate tax is for the most part paid by workers.\par \par \uc2 This result was controversial at first, and appropriately so. Scientific and economic progress flows from attempts to question and replicate. There has since been a profusion of research that confirms that workers suffer when corporate tax rates are higher.\par \par \uc2 In a 2007 paper Federal Reserve economist \uc2 Alison Felix\uc2  used data from the Luxembourg Income Study, which tracks individual incomes across 30 countries, to show that a 10% increase in corporate tax rates reduces wages by about 7%. In a 2009 paper Ms. Felix found similar patterns across the U.S., where states with higher corporate tax rates have significantly lower wages. In another 2009 paper, Ms. Felix and co-author James R. Hines of the \uc2 University of Michigan\uc2  discovered that the effects of lower tax rates are especially strong for union workers.\par \par \uc2 Confirmation has come in a number of additional settings. Harvard University economists Mihir Desai, Fritz Foley and Michigan's James R. Hines have studied data from American multinational firms, finding that their foreign affiliates tend to pay significantly higher wages in countries with lower corporate tax rates. A study by Nadja Dwenger, Pia Rattenhuber and Viktor Steiner found similar patterns across German regions, and a study by Clemens Fuest, Andreas Peichl and Sebastian Siegloch found the same across German municipalities.\par \par \uc2 The most recent paper to find significant effects on wages was released in May and will soon be published by Canadian economists Kenneth McKenzie and Ergete Ferede. They found that wages in Canadian provinces drop by more than a dollar when corporate tax revenue is increased by a dollar. Similar patterns have been identified when Canadian economists have studied individual-level income data.\par \par \uc2 These studies and others convincingly demonstrate that higher wages are relatively easy to stimulate for a nation. One need only cut corporate tax rates. Left and right leaning countries have done this over the past two decades, including Japan, Canada and Germany. Yet in the U.S. we continue to undermine wage growth with the highest corporate tax rate in the developed world.\par \par \uc2 Why are we stuck in such a bad place? A key factor has been the intransigence of Democratic politicians, such as Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , whose plan to increase wages is to keep taxes high at the corporate level, increase taxes on business income at the individual level, and to punish firms that move overseas in response to these high taxes.\par \par \uc2 This anti-corporate policy may be music to the ears of supporters of Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren and the Democratic Party's left wing, but it will make the lives of ordinary Americans worse. Wage growth will continue to be disappointing as long as the U.S. has the world's highest corporate tax rate. Denying the need for lower corporate rates may be effective populism, but it is causing real harm to America's workers.\par \par \uc2 ---\par \par \uc2 Mr. Hassett is director of research for domestic policy at the \uc2 American Enterprise Institute\uc2 , where Ms. Mathur is a resident scholar.\par \par \uc2 (See related letters: "Letters to the Editor: Taxes Make U.S. Companies Takeover Targets" -- WSJ Aug. 22, 2016)\par \par \uc2 (See related letters: "Letters to the Editor: Wage Stagnation and Corporate Income Taxes" -- WSJ August 31, 2016)\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=wjco20160815000020"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document J000000020160815ec8f0000j\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw272\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4080\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 REVIEW & OUTLOOK (Editorial)\par \b \uc2 Trump\uc2 's Self-Reckoning\b0\par\par\uc2 875 \uc2 words\par \uc2 15 August 2016\par \uc2 The Wall Street Journal\par \uc2 J\par A10\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  lashed out at the media on Sunday after more stories describing dysfunction inside his presidential campaign. "If the disgusting and corrupt media covered me honestly and didn't put false meaning into the words I say, I would be beating Hillary by 20%," Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  averred on \uc2 Twitter\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  is right that most of the media want him to lose, but then that was also true of George W. Bush, George H.W. Bush and Ronald Reagan. It's true of every Republican presidential nominee. The difference is that Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  has made it so easy for the media and his opponents.\par \par \uc2 The latest stories comport with what we also hear from sources close to the \uc2 Trump\uc2  campaign. Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's advisers and his family want the candidate to deliver a consistent message making the case for change. They'd like him to be disciplined. They want him to focus on growing the economy and raising incomes and fighting terrorism.\par \par \uc2 They think he should make the \uc2 election\uc2  a referendum on \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , not on himself. And they'd like him to spend a little time each day -- a half hour even -- studying the issues he'll need to understand if he becomes President.\par \par \uc2 Is that so hard? Apparently so. Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  prefers to watch the cable shows rather than read a briefing paper. He thinks the same shoot-from-the-lip style that won over a plurality of GOP primary voters can persuade other Republicans and independents who worry if he has the temperament to be Commander in Chief.\par \par \uc2 He also thinks the crowds at his campaign rallies are a substitute for the lack of a field organization and digital turnout strategy. And he thinks that \uc2 Twitter\uc2  and social media can make up for being outspent $100 million to zero in battleground states.\par \par \uc2 By now it should be obvious that none of this is working. It's obvious to many of his advisers, who are the sources for the news stories about dysfunction. They may be covering for themselves, but this is what happens in failing campaigns. The difference is that the recriminations typically start in October, not mid-August.\par \par \uc2 These stories are appearing now because the polls show that Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  is on the path to losing a winnable race. He is now losing in every key battleground state, some like New Hampshire by double digits. The Midwest industrial states he claimed he would put into play -- Wisconsin, Pennsylvania -- have turned sharply toward Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 More ominously, states won by \uc2 John McCain\uc2  and \uc2 Mitt Romney\uc2  are much closer than they should be. If Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  is fighting to hold Georgia, Arizona and even Utah by September, a landslide defeat becomes all too possible.\par \par \uc2 The tragedy is that this is happening in a year when Republicans should win. The political scientist Alan Abramowitz has spent years developing his "time for a change" forecasting model. The model looks at the rate of GDP growth in the second quarter of an \uc2 election\uc2  year (1.2% this year), the incumbent President's approval rating, and the electorate's desire for change after one party has held the White House for eight years.\par \par \uc2 No model is perfect, but Mr. Abramowitz's has predicted the winner of the major-party popular vote in every presidential \uc2 election\uc2  since 1988. His model predicts that Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  should win a narrow victory with 51.4%. A mainstream GOP candidate who runs a reasonably competent campaign would have about a 66% chance of victory.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  has alienated his party and he isn't running a competent campaign. Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  is the second most unpopular presidential nominee in history -- after Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 . But rather than reassure voters and try to repair his image, \uc2 the New Yorker\uc2  has spent the last three weeks giving his critics more ammunition.\par \par \uc2 Even with more than 80 days left, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's window for a turnaround is closing. The "\uc2 Trump\uc2  pivot" always seemed implausible given his lifelong instincts and habits, but Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  promised Republicans. "At some point I'll be so presidential that you people will be so bored, and I'll come back as a presidential person, and instead of 10,000 people I'll have about 150 people and they'll say, boy, he really looks presidential," he said in April.\par \par \uc2 Those who sold Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  to GOP voters as the man who could defeat \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  now face a moment of truth. \uc2 Chris Christie\uc2 , \uc2 Newt Gingrich\uc2 , \uc2 Rudy Giuliani\uc2 , \uc2 Paul Manafort\uc2  and the talk-radio right told Republicans their man could rise to the occasion.\par \par \uc2 If they can't get Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  to change his act by Labor Day, the GOP will have no choice but to write off the nominee as hopeless and focus on salvaging the Senate and House and other down-ballot races. As for Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , he needs to stop blaming everyone else and decide if he wants to behave like someone who wants to be President -- or turn the nomination over to \uc2 Mike Pence\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 (See related letters: "Letters to the Editor: The \uc2 Trump\uc2  Effect on the Republican Party" -- WSJ Aug. 19, 2016)\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=wjco20160815000011"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document J000000020160815ec8f0000a\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw272\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4080\pichgoal600

\par\par \b \uc2 Global Finance: \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  Moves Market -- in Mexico --- Peso climbs as candidate declines in polls, some traders say; others don't see a link\b0\par\par\uc2 By Anthony Harrup   \par \uc2 742 \uc2 words\par \uc2 15 August 2016\par \uc2 The Wall Street Journal\par \uc2 J\par C3\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 MEXICO CITY -- Traders in the Mexican peso long used to watching out for anything from oil prices to U.S. payrolls have one more thing to consider: polls showing who is ahead in the race for the White House.\par \par \uc2 A spate of recent surveys showing Democratic candidate \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  ahead of Republican \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  coincided with the peso reaching its strongest level against the U.S. dollar since the end of June, when the \uc2 Bank of Mexico\uc2  raised interest rates by an unexpected half of a percentage point. A number of traders and analysts said those polls contributed to the peso's gains.\par \par \uc2 "The peso is rallying and, more importantly, it has more room to appreciate as \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  continues to climb in the polls -- gaining ground on \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2 , who has proposed policies that could potentially hurt Mexico's economy," Nomura Latin America strategist Benito Berber said in a note to clients Tuesday.\par \par \uc2 Although things could change between now and November, "the fact remains that the gap favoring \uc2 Clinton\uc2  has widened recently and that should be supportive for the peso," Mr. Berber added.\par \par \uc2 The peso ended trading in Mexico City on Friday at about 18.245 to the U.S. dollar, compared with 18.90 a week earlier. It remained down nearly 6% in the year to date.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's bid for the White House has put an unusual spotlight on Mexico. The Republican nominee has said he would build a wall along the border between the U.S. and Mexico to keep out illegal immigrants; kick out illegal immigrants already in the U.S. and make Mexico pay for the wall by restricting money transfers home by Mexicans working in the U.S., imposing trade tariffs or raising visa fees. He also has said he would renegotiate terms of the \uc2 North American Free Trade Agreement\uc2  or abandon it.\par \par \uc2 "Challenges to globalization and Nafta in particular would deal a severe blow to Mexico's economy, require policy makers to deliver another round of deep structural reforms to sustain long-term growth, and likely lead to a more depreciated peso," analysts at \uc2 Morgan Stanley\uc2  said in a recent report.\par \par \uc2 Whether any of that is concrete enough yet to be factored into foreign-exchange dealings is a matter of debate. Some people in the market don't find the link between the U.S. pre-\uc2 election\uc2  polls and the peso that compelling.\par \par \uc2 "It's been a popular theme since the nomination, and there was a lot of noise with the conventions, although it seems very nebulous to me," said Win Thin, global head of emerging-market currency strategy at \uc2 Brown Brothers Harriman\uc2 . "Clients aren't saying, 'I'm staying out of Mexico because \uc2 Trump\uc2  might win.'"\par \par \uc2 Mr. Thin sees more fundamental factors behind the peso's recent behavior, including a recovery in oil prices, lower expectations for an increase in U.S. interest rates anytime soon and monetary easing by major central banks, which has been driving investors into emerging markets in search of higher yields.\par \par \uc2 As one of the world's most-traded currencies, the peso is often used as a hedge for exposure to emerging markets broadly; when investors shy away from risk, the peso takes a hit. The oil-price slump of the past two years has taken a toll on the peso, as have on-again-off-again expectations of U.S. rate increases. And the peso hit a record low of 19.52 to the dollar as global markets shuddered in the wake of the U.K. vote to leave the \uc2 European Union\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 For some peso traders, the possibility of a \uc2 Trump\uc2  presidency has been added to the list of things that could go wrong for the peso. In its monetary-policy statement Thursday, the \uc2 Bank of Mexico\uc2  said uncertainty over the outcome of the U.S. \uc2 election\uc2  is among factors that could cause the peso to depreciate.\par \par \uc2 "The \uc2 Trump\uc2  factor is a theme, as a victory could lead to capital outflows," said Eduardo Ontiveros, head currency trader at \uc2 Grupo Financiero Interacciones\uc2  in Mexico City.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Ontiveros compared the recent currency gains with losses when Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  was shown ahead in a number of polls following the Republican Party convention in July.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=wjco20160815000097"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document J000000020160815ec8f0002o\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw272\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4080\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 Corrections & Amplifications\par \par \uc2 The first name of U.S. Sen. Claire McCaskill (D., Mo.) was misspelled as Clare in an \uc2 Election\uc2  2016 article Monday about Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  and the media.\par \par \uc2 (WSJ August 16, 2016)\par \par \uc2 (END)\par \par \uc2 Beset by sagging poll numbers, Republican presidential nominee \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  is stepping up his attacks on news organizations, suggesting that biased coverage is turning the \uc2 election\uc2  against him.\par \par \uc2 In speeches, tweets and TV appearances, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  and his backers in recent days suggested he would be ahead in the polls if the media didn't favor his opponent, Democrat \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 "If the disgusting and corrupt media covered me honestly and didn't put false meaning into the words I say, I would be beating Hillary by 20%," Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  tweeted Sunday.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  is under pressure from many in the GOP to steer his campaign beyond his signature incendiary comments and toward substance that might broaden his appeal. Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  is planning a foreign-policy speech in Youngstown, Ohio, on Monday, and on Tuesday he is scheduled to hold an event in Milwaukee, site of weekend violence over a police shooting.\par \par \uc2 But Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's bumpy past couple of weeks, reflected in his worsening poll numbers, illustrate how his controversial statements are now playing differently than they did in the crowded GOP primary race. Just in the past week, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  charged repeatedly that President \uc2 Barack Obama\uc2  was "the founder" of Islamic State and encouraged "Second Amendment people" to take unspecified action against Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  and the judges she might appoint if she wins the White House.\par \par \uc2 A \uc2 CBS News\uc2  poll released Sunday found that 45% of likely voters in New Hampshire supported Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , compared with 36% backing Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 . Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  held a 45% to 40% lead in Florida.\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 CBS\uc2  poll followed a Wall Street Journal/NBC News/Marist poll of registered voters last week that gave Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  a sizable edge in Colorado, Virginia and North Carolina and a smaller advantage in Florida.\par \par \uc2 During an appearance on Fox News Sunday, Democratic Sen. Clare McCaskill of Missouri referred to the \uc2 Trump\uc2  campaign as a "dumpster fire."\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 Trump\uc2  campaign blamed setbacks on the media, turning that argument into a fundraising pitch. "You've seen it -- the liberal media can't stop telling outrageous lies about me," Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  wrote in an email Friday asking backers to contribute money.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  has routinely called reporters "very bad people." But over the weekend, he and his aides upped the volume. Saturday, he threatened to yank the campaign press credentials from the \uc2 New York Times\uc2  over an article saying his campaign is in disarray.\par \par \uc2 Campaign chairman \uc2 Paul Manafort\uc2  said Sunday there has been a failure to cover Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's policy proposals. "\uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  in the course of this week was very substantive," he said on \uc2 CNN\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 ---\par \par \uc2 Julian Routh contributed to this article.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=wjco20160815000056"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document J000000020160815ec8f0001j\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

Kramer reported from Kiev, and Mike McIntire and Barry Meier from New York. Steven Lee Myers contributed reporting from Washington. \par \uc2 2,274 \uc2 words\par \uc2 15 August 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 1\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 KIEV, Ukraine -- On a leafy side street off Independence Square in Kiev is an office used for years by \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's campaign chairman, \uc2 Paul Manafort\uc2 , when he consulted for Ukraine's ruling political party. His furniture and personal items were still there as recently as May.\par \par \uc2 And Mr. Manafort's presence remains elsewhere here in the capital, where government investigators examining secret records have found his name, as well as companies he sought business with, as they try to untangle a corrupt network they say was used to loot Ukrainian assets and influence elections during the administration of Mr. Manafort's main client, former President Viktor F. Yanukovych.\par \par \uc2 Handwritten ledgers show $12.7 million in undisclosed cash payments designated for Mr. Manafort from Mr. Yanukovych's pro-Russian political party from 2007 to 2012, according to Ukraine's newly formed National Anti-Corruption Bureau. Investigators assert that the disbursements were part of an illegal off-the-books system whose recipients also included \uc2 election\uc2  officials.\par \par \uc2 In addition, criminal prosecutors are investigating a group of offshore shell companies that helped members of Mr. Yanukovych's inner circle finance their lavish lifestyles, including a palatial presidential residence with a private zoo, golf course and tennis court. Among the hundreds of murky transactions these companies engaged in was an $18 million deal to sell Ukrainian cable television assets to a partnership put together by Mr. Manafort and a Russian oligarch, \uc2 Oleg Deripaska\uc2 , a close ally of President \uc2 Vladimir V. Putin\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Mr. Manafort's involvement with moneyed interests in Russia and Ukraine had previously come to light. But as American relationships there become a rising issue in the presidential campaign -- from Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's favorable statements about Mr. Putin and his annexation of Crimea to the suspected Russian hacking of Democrats' emails -- an examination of Mr. Manafort's activities offers new details of how he mixed politics and business out of public view and benefited from powerful interests now under scrutiny by the new government in Kiev.\par \par \uc2 Anti-corruption officials there say the payments earmarked for Mr. Manafort, previously unreported, are a focus of their investigation, though they have yet to determine if he actually received the cash. While Mr. Manafort is not a target in the separate inquiry of offshore activities, prosecutors say he must have realized the implications of his financial dealings.\par \par \uc2 ''He understood what was happening in Ukraine,'' said Vitaliy Kasko, a former senior official with the general prosecutor's office in Kiev. ''It would have to be clear to any reasonable person that the Yanukovych clan, when it came to power, was engaged in corruption.''\par \par \uc2 Mr. Kasko added, ''It's impossible to imagine a person would look at this and think, 'Everything is all right.'''\par \par \uc2 Mr. Manafort did not respond to interview requests or written questions from The \uc2 New York Times\uc2 . But his lawyer, Richard A. Hibey, said Mr. Manafort had not received ''any such cash payments'' described by the anti-corruption officials.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Hibey also disputed Mr. Kasko's suggestion that Mr. Manafort might have countenanced corruption or been involved with people who took part in illegal activities.\par \par \uc2 ''These are suspicions, and probably heavily politically tinged ones,'' said Mr. Hibey, a member of the Washington law firm Miller & Chevalier. ''It is difficult to respect any kind of allegation of the sort being made here to smear someone when there is no proof and we deny there ever could be such proof.''\par \par \uc2 Mysterious Payments\par \par \uc2 The developments in Ukraine underscore the risky nature of the international consulting that has been a staple of Mr. Manafort's business since the 1980s, when he went to work for the Philippine dictator Ferdinand Marcos. Before joining Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's campaign this spring, Mr. Manafort's most prominent recent client was Mr. Yanukovych, who -- like Mr. Marcos -- was deposed in a popular uprising.\par \par \uc2 Before he fled to Russia two years ago, Mr. Yanukovych and his Party of Regions relied heavily on the advice of Mr. Manafort and his firm, who helped them win several elections. During that period, Mr. Manafort never registered as a foreign agent with the \uc2 United States Justice Department\uc2  -- as required of those seeking to influence American policy on behalf of foreign clients -- although one of his subcontractors did.\par \par \uc2 It is unclear if Mr. Manafort's activities necessitated registering. If they were limited to advising the Party of Regions in Ukraine, he probably would not have had to. But he also worked to burnish his client's image in the West and helped Mr. Yanukovych's administration draft a report defending its prosecution of his chief rival, Yulia V. Tymoshenko, in 2012.\par \par \uc2 Whatever the case, absent a registration -- which requires disclosure of how much the registrant is being paid and by whom -- Mr. Manafort's compensation has remained a mystery. However, a cache of documents discovered after the fall of Mr. Yanukovych's government may provide some answers.\par \par \uc2 The papers, known in Ukraine as the ''black ledger,'' are a chicken-scratch of Cyrillic covering about 400 pages taken from books once kept in a third-floor room in the former Party of Regions headquarters on Lipskaya Street in Kiev. The room held two safes stuffed with $100 bills, said Taras V. Chornovil, a former party leader who was also a recipient of the money at times. He said in an interview that he had once received $10,000 in a ''wad of cash'' for a trip to Europe.\par \par \uc2 ''This was our cash,'' he said, adding that he had left the party in part over concerns about off-the-books activity. ''They had it on the table, stacks of money, and they had lists of who to pay.''\par \par \uc2 The National Anti-Corruption Bureau, which obtained the ledger, said in a statement that Mr. Manafort's name appeared 22 times in the documents over five years, with payments totaling $12.7 million. The purpose of the payments is not clear. Nor is the outcome, since the handwritten entries cannot be cross-referenced against banking records, and the signatures for receipt have not yet been verified.\par \par \uc2 ''\uc2 Paul Manafort\uc2  is among those names on the list of so-called 'black accounts of the Party of Regions,' which the detectives of the National Anti-Corruption Bureau of Ukraine are investigating,'' the statement said. ''We emphasize that the presence of P. Manafort's name in the list does not mean that he actually got the money, because the signatures that appear in the column of recipients could belong to other people.''\par \par \uc2 The accounting records surfaced this year, when Serhiy A. Leshchenko, a member of Parliament who said he had received a partial copy from a source he did not identify, published line items covering six months of outlays in 2012 totaling $66 million. In an interview, Mr. Leshchenko said another source had provided the entire multiyear ledger to Viktor M. Trepak, a former deputy director of the domestic intelligence agency of Ukraine, the S.B.U., who passed it to the National Anti-Corruption Bureau.\par \par \uc2 The bureau, whose government funding is mandated under American and \uc2 European Union\uc2  aid programs and which has an evidence-sharing agreement with the F.B.I., has investigatory powers but cannot indict suspects. Only if it passes its findings to prosecutors -- which has not happened with Mr. Manafort -- does a subject of its inquiry become part of a criminal case.\par \par \uc2 Individual disbursements reflected in the ledgers ranged from a few hundred dollars to millions of dollars. Of the records released from 2012, one shows a payment of $67,000 for a watch and another of $8.4 million to the owner of an advertising agency for campaign work for the party before elections that year.\par \par \uc2 ''It's a very vivid example of how political parties are financed in Ukraine,'' said Daria N. Kaleniuk, the executive director of the Anti-Corruption Action Center in Kiev. ''It represents the very dirty cash economy in Ukraine.''\par \par \uc2 Offshore Companies\par \par \uc2 While working in Ukraine, Mr. Manafort had also positioned himself to profit from business deals that benefited from connections he had gained through his political consulting. One of them, according to court filings, involved a network of offshore companies that government investigators and independent journalists in Ukraine have said was used to launder public money and assets purportedly stolen by cronies of the government.\par \par \uc2 The network comprised shell companies whose ultimate owners were shielded by the secrecy laws of the offshore jurisdictions where they were registered, including the British Virgin Islands, Belize and the Seychelles.\par \par \uc2 In a recent interview, Serhiy V. Gorbatyuk, Ukraine's special prosecutor for high-level corruption cases, pointed to an open file on his desk containing paperwork for one of the shell companies, Milltown Corporate Services Ltd., which played a central role in the state's purchase of two oil derricks for $785 million, or about double what they were said to be worth.\par \par \uc2 ''This,'' he said, ''was an offshore used often by Mr. Yanukovych's entourage.''\par \par \uc2 The role of the offshore companies in business dealings involving Mr. Manafort came to light because of court filings in the Cayman Islands and in a federal court in Virginia related to an investment fund, Pericles Emerging Markets. Mr. Manafort and several partners started the fund in 2007, and its major backer was Mr. Deripaska, the Russian mogul, to whom the State Department has refused to issue a visa, apparently because of allegations linking him to Russian organized crime, a charge he has denied.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Deripaska agreed to commit as much as $100 million to Pericles so it could buy assets in Ukraine and Eastern Europe, including a regional cable television and communications company called Black Sea Cable. But corporate records and court filings show that it was hardly a straightforward transaction.\par \par \uc2 The Black Sea Cable assets were controlled by a rotating cast of offshore companies that led back to the Yanukovych network, including, at various times, Milltown Corporate Services and two other companies well known to law enforcement officials, Monohold A.G. and Intrahold A.G. Those two companies won inflated contracts with a state-run agricultural company, and also acquired a business center in Kiev with a helicopter pad on the roof that would ease Mr. Yanukovych's commute from his country estate to the presidential offices.\par \par \uc2 A Disputed Investment\par \par \uc2 Mr. Deripaska would later say he invested $18.9 million in Pericles in 2008 to complete the acquisition of Black Sea Cable. But the planned purchase -- including the question of who ended up with the Black Sea assets -- has since become the subject of a dispute between Mr. Deripaska and Mr. Manafort.\par \par \uc2 In 2014, Mr. Deripaska filed a legal action in a Cayman Islands court seeking to recover his investment in Pericles, which is now defunct. He also said he had paid about $7.3 million in management fees to the fund over two years. Mr. Deripaska did not respond to requests for comment.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Manafort's lawyer, Mr. Hibey, disputed the account of the Black Sea Cable deal contained in Mr. Deripaska's Cayman filings, and said the Russian oligarch had overseen details of the final transaction involving the acquisition. He denied that Mr. Manafort had received management fees from Pericles during its operation, but said that one of Mr. Manafort's partners, Rick Gates, who is also working on the \uc2 Trump\uc2  campaign, had received a ''nominal'' sum.\par \par \uc2 Court papers indicate that Pericles' only deal involved Black Sea Cable.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Manafort continued working in Ukraine after the demise of Mr. Yanukovych's government, helping allies of the ousted president and others form a political bloc that opposed the new pro-Western administration. Some of his aides were in Ukraine as recently as this year, and Ukrainian company records give no indication that Mr. Manafort has formally dissolved the local branch of his company, Davis Manafort International, directed by a longtime assistant, Konstantin V. Kilimnik.\par \par \uc2 At Mr. Manafort's old office on Sofiivska Street, new tenants said they had discovered several curiosities apparently left behind, including a knee X-ray signed by Mr. Yanukovych, possibly referring to tennis matches played between Mr. Manafort and Mr. Yanukovych, who had spoken publicly of a knee ailment affecting his game.\par \par \uc2 There was another item with Mr. Yanukovych's autograph: a piece of white paper bearing a rough sketch of Independence Square, the site of the 2014 uprising that drove him from power.\par \par \uc2 Find out what you need to know about the 2016 presidential race today, and get politics news updates via \uc2 Facebook\uc2 , \uc2 Twitter\uc2  and the First Draft newsletter.\par \par \uc2 Paul Manafort, Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's campaign chairman.

\par\par \uc2 National Desk; SECTA\par \b \uc2 Some Liberals Worry \uc2 Clinton\uc2  Faces Risks in Focus on \uc2 Trump\b0\par\par\uc2 By MATT FLEGENHEIMER \par \uc2 1,484 \uc2 words\par \uc2 15 August 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 1\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Liberal Democrats and progressive activists have grown wary of the state of the 2016 presidential race, chafing at \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's big-tent courtship of Republican leaders they have long opposed and fearing the consequences of shaping the contest as a referendum on \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 While few have questioned the electoral strategy of bringing Republicans into the fold by casting Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  as a singular threat to democracy, both skeptics and some admirers of Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  have come to view her decisive advantage in the polls with mixed emotions.\par \par \uc2 She may win by a mandate-level margin, they say. But what, exactly, would the mandate be for?\par \par \uc2 In a matter of weeks, beginning with the party conventions, the policy-driven debates that animated the Democratic primary race have largely disappeared from the political foreground, giving way to discussions of Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's temperament, his inflammatory remarks and even his sanity.\par \par \uc2 ''If she's going to get anything done as president, she is going to have to have a mandate,'' said Robert B. Reich, a secretary of labor in Bill \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's administration who supported Bernie Sanders in the primary.\par \par \uc2 The subject of Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's temperament was unavoidable, Mr. Reich said, ''but temperament doesn't give you a mandate to do anything.''\par \par \uc2 Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's dogged pursuit of Republican votes has especially rankled progressives, and highlights the divisions within the Democratic Party, even as they see a victory more likely. They have grumbled at her eager promotion of endorsements from veterans of the George W. Bush and Reagan administrations, including that of \uc2 John D. Negroponte\uc2 , a top diplomat and intelligence official under Mr. Bush. They worry aloud that Henry Kissinger, of whom Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  has often spoken fondly, could be next.\par \par \uc2 ''Secretary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's decision to aggressively court \uc2 Mitt Romney\uc2 's base has her looking more and more like \uc2 Mitt Romney\uc2  every day,'' said Benjamin T. Jealous, a former N.A.A.C.P. president who initially supported Mr. Sanders. ''That's not a good thing.''\par \par \uc2 By most measures, the Democratic Party's left flank has had a banner year. Mr. Sanders's primary challenge pushed Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  conspicuously left, coaxing her into policy shifts on trade and college tuition. The party platform was, by virtually all accounts, the most progressive in history, and Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  has not made any perceptible changes in substance recently.\par \par \uc2 Notably, a major economic speech from Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  on Thursday in Michigan would not have seemed out of place in the primary race, with discussions of expanded Social Security, debt-free college and a higher minimum wage.\par \par \uc2 And on Friday morning, her campaign, sensitive to any suggestion that Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  might waver on promises to the left, emailed reporters a collection of 22 sympathetic quotes and \uc2 Twitter\uc2  posts from left-leaning leaders and organizations.\par \par \uc2 ''She is not just running as the alternative to the other guy. She is running on a progressive policy agenda that she seriously believes will make a difference in people's lives,'' Brian Fallon, a campaign spokesman, said in an email. ''If she wins, it will not just mean a rejection of \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2 . It will be a call to action on the issues she has championed.''\par \par \uc2 But the campaign's chief gambit since the start of the Democratic convention -- depicting Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  as a menacing anomaly, disconnected from mainstream Republican thought -- has already supplied \uc2 Trump\uc2 -averse conservatives with an opening: Even if Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  wins big, Republicans opposed to Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's rise may argue that Americans were not voting for her policy proposals.\par \par \uc2 Some are not waiting.\par \par \uc2 ''\uc2 Clinton\uc2  is not likely to emerge with a legislative mandate,'' said Rick Tyler, a former top aide to Senator Ted Cruz's presidential run. ''She will have to start from zero in terms of selling all her policy proposals. They will not have been sold through this process.''\par \par \uc2 Mr. Tyler, who believes the 2016 \uc2 election\uc2  has effectively been decided, predicted a common refrain from Republican legislators next year: ''We didn't see that the people voted for that; we see that the people voted against \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2 .''\par \par \uc2 In interviews, elected progressive leaders, activists and local lawmakers made clear that their top priority remains defeating Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 . Most cautioned that the race was a long way from over, despite a wave of encouraging polls for Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Still, some liberals fear their leverage has been diminished, though the vast majority of Sanders supporters have rallied to Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's side, if sometimes tepidly. If she can win without generating excitement among that already distrustful wing of the party, they reason, she may be less inclined to accommodate it once in office.\par \par \uc2 ''We need the broadest popular front against \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2 ,'' said Bill Lipton, a founder of the \uc2 Working Families Party\uc2 . ''The challenge for the left is, if that's all we do, we're saying anyone one degree to the left of David Duke is O.K. with us.''\par \par \uc2 Many of Mr. Sanders's backers believe that two of the principal issues he raised during his primary contest against Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  -- her foreign policy hawkishness and her Wall Street ties -- remain central to her political core.\par \par \uc2 ''I fully expected that we would be at war with the \uc2 Clinton\uc2  administration, if there is one,'' said Jonathan Tasini, a former union leader who challenged Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  in her Senate primary in 2006. ''Once she is elected, I suspect she will go back to being what she is, which is a relatively moderate, centrist, corporate Democrat.''\par \par \uc2 Helen Gym, a Philadelphia City Council member who supported Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  in the primary, said the dynamics between Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's team and the party's activist base reflected ''a fragile negotiation.''\par \par \uc2 ''The coalition has to hold together,'' she said. ''Is a \uc2 Clinton\uc2  victory synonymous with a progressive victory? It depends. I don't think I can give a full yes or no.''\par \par \uc2 Megan Ellyia Green, a St. Louis alderwoman and Sanders delegate, said she feared Democrats were squandering ''our New Deal moment'' by not focusing voters' attention more intensely on the issues that powered enthusiasm for Mr. Sanders.\par \par \uc2 Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  and her team have long ago grown weary of any implication that she is not entirely committed to liberal causes, repeatedly presenting her as a fusion of pragmatism and idealism. She has called herself ''a progressive who likes to get things done.''\par \par \uc2 In both of her presidential primary runs, Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  accused her opponents -- first \uc2 Barack Obama\uc2  in 2008, then Mr. Sanders -- of promising more than they could credibly deliver.\par \par \uc2 But when approached at her rallies, even zealous \uc2 Clinton\uc2  supporters are often hard-pressed to name a signature policy proposal of hers. Her speech in Michigan touched on, among other things, a planned $275 billion infrastructure investment and green energy spending.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Fallon noted that Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  has pledged to act on issues ranging from immigration reform to gun safety. On some such measures, she has promised to pursue executive action in the face of possible congressional resistance.\par \par \uc2 Recent unease from the left has often centered more on presentation and messaging than on the merits of her proposals.\par \par \uc2 ''Her policy proposals are admirably detailed, but they cover so much ground that their whole is less than the sum of their parts,'' Mr. Reich said. ''She really needs to focus on a few big ideas.''\par \par \uc2 Some \uc2 Clinton\uc2  allies have argued that the most pressing goal should be to run up the largest possible margin of victory, which could enable the party to seize down-ballot seats that might be unwinnable in an ordinary year.\par \par \uc2 And a number of candidates in such elections, including some elevated by Mr. Sanders, have said it is incumbent on them to frame their races as something more than a \uc2 Trump\uc2  litmus test.\par \par \uc2 ''It's up to us,'' said \uc2 Pramila Jayapal\uc2 , a Washington state senator who recently won her primary in a run for Congress.\par \par \uc2 Adam Green, a founder of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee, said Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's efforts to cast a wide net and train voters' attention on Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  amounted to a ''double-edged sword.''\par \par \uc2 ''Republicans in Congress won't grant as easily after the \uc2 election\uc2  that we won a huge mandate on progressive issues, but thanks to \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2 , we might have more progressives and majorities in Congress,'' Mr. Green said. ''I'd rather have a Republican minority in denial about what just happened than a Republican majority standing in the way.''\par \par \uc2 Find out what you need to know about the 2016 presidential race today, and get politics news updates via \uc2 Facebook\uc2 , \uc2 Twitter\uc2  and the First Draft newsletter.\par \par \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  at a rally last week in St. Petersburg, Fla.

\par\par \uc2 National Desk; SECTA\par \b \uc2 Health Insurers Use Reviews, Intended to Constrain Rate Jumps, to Justify Them\b0\par\par\uc2 By ROBERT PEAR \par \uc2 1,254 \uc2 words\par \uc2 15 August 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 13\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 WASHINGTON -- After the Affordable Care Act took effect in 2010, it created a review mechanism intended to prevent exorbitant increases in health insurance rates by shaming companies that sought them.\par \par \uc2 But this summer, insurers are turning that process on its head, using it to highlight the reasons they are losing money under the health care law and their case for raising premiums in 2017.\par \par \uc2 That has ignited an \uc2 election\uc2 -year fight between insurers and consumers, who are complaining bitterly about the double-digit increases being sought across the country.\par \par \uc2 The conflicts have been on vivid display at hearings in states like Pennsylvania, where Highmark, one of the state's largest insurers, has proposed rate increases averaging 41 percent.\par \par \uc2 ''The health of the citizens of Pennsylvania is worth more than the profits desired by health insurance companies,'' Rose Lynd, 35, of Pittsburgh, testified at a hearing in Harrisburg held late last month by the Pennsylvania insurance commissioner, Teresa D. Miller, a former Obama administration official.\par \par \uc2 Ms. Lynd, a cancer survivor, said her costs were onerous.\par \par \uc2 ''My premiums are more than $600 a month, which is more than our mortgage payment,'' Ms. Lynd said. ''I am grateful that the Affordable Care Act is here for my family, but I am disappointed by its limitations. All I want is a plan that makes our health care affordable, but it doesn't exist.''\par \par \uc2 Highmark defended its request by saying it was paying out more in claims than it was receiving in premiums. Jeff Scheib, the vice president in charge of actuarial services at Highmark, offered a statistic to illustrate the problem.\par \par \uc2 ''There were close to 250 individual A.C.A. policyholders in Pennsylvania who incurred over $100,000 each in claims and then canceled coverage before the end of the year,'' Mr. Scheib testified. ''This behavior drives up the cost to insure the entire pool, because people use insurance benefits and then discontinue paying for coverage once their individual health care needs have been temporarily met.''\par \par \uc2 While state insurance commissioners, who review rates, are trying to balance the needs of consumers and insurers in a turbulent market, insurers have extra leverage this year. At least a dozen nonprofit health insurance cooperatives have collapsed, and several big commercial insurers have decided to cut their losses by limiting their participation in the insurance exchanges, the new marketplaces created under the health law.\par \par \uc2 The problems threaten to shadow Democrats through \uc2 Election\uc2  Day. While \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  has vowed to ''defend and expand'' the Affordable Care Act, her Republican opponent in the presidential race, Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , has seized on the issue. At a rally in Fairfield, Conn., on Saturday, he repeated his vow to repeal the health law, saying consumers were facing rate increases greater than they had ever seen.\par \par \uc2 Ms. Miller, the Pennsylvania commissioner, said that protecting consumers was a top priority. But she said, ''The large requests before me this year are not unique to Pennsylvania, unfortunately.'' Arthur M. Lucker, a consultant to the Pennsylvania Insurance Department, said insurers had requested rate increases of more than 25 percent in at least 20 states, including Arizona, Florida, Ohio and Texas.\par \par \uc2 Aviva Aron-Dine, an economist at the federal \uc2 Department of Health and Human Services\uc2 , said predictable factors were behind the upward pressure on rates. For example, the federal government is ending a program that helped pay some of the largest claims incurred by insurers.\par \par \uc2 In addition, Ms. Aron-Dine said, some insurers may be trying to make up for having initially set premiums too low. In any event, she said, most people buying insurance on the exchanges receive subsidies.\par \par \uc2 Connecticut has a state-run insurance exchange considered one of the most successful in the nation. But that has not provided a guarantee of stable rates.\par \par \uc2 Anthem, for example, is seeking an average increase of 27 percent in Connecticut.\par \par \uc2 That is ''just off the charts and unacceptable,'' one Anthem customer, \uc2 Douglas H. Wade Jr\uc2 . of Bridgeport, said at a hearing in Hartford on Aug. 3.\par \par \uc2 Matthew McDermott, the leader of an interfaith advocacy group, Congregations Organized for a New Connecticut, said: ''We're concerned that the proposed rate increases will drive many employers and many individuals to drop coverage altogether. And we worry that that heads us toward a market failure here in Connecticut.''\par \par \uc2 Two of the four insurers on the Connecticut exchange have indicated that they will not be offering plans in that marketplace next year. ''Higher-than-expected health care costs have jeopardized the financial solvency of some insurers and have caused other insurers to leave the exchange altogether,'' said James Augur, a regional vice president of Anthem in Connecticut.\par \par \uc2 At a hearing in Helena, Mont., Monica J. Lindeen, the state insurance commissioner, asked \uc2 Blue Cross\uc2  and Blue Shield why it was seeking an average rate increase of 62 percent for 2017, after receiving an increase of 22 percent this year.\par \par \uc2 ''Cost is what's really driving our rate increases,'' said Michael E. Frank, the president of Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Montana.\par \par \uc2 ''For every dollar we brought in last year, we paid out $1.26 for medical care,'' Mr. Frank said. ''In the first six months of this year, we have already paid $4.17 million in medical costs for the top 10 individuals. That's $70,000 a month for those individuals.''\par \par \uc2 Insurers invariably cite drug costs as a factor driving up premiums. \uc2 James Spencer\uc2 , the chief actuary of Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Montana, said 1 percent of prescriptions accounted for 30 percent of pharmacy costs.\par \par \uc2 Ms. Lindeen wanted to know why Montana Blue Cross and its parent company, \uc2 Health Care Service Corporation\uc2 , had not constrained the pay of top executives. The parent company reported total compensation of more than $11 million for its chief executive in 2014. A \uc2 Blue Cross\uc2  executive told Ms. Lindeen that executive pay reflected ''the size and complexity of our business'' and was a tiny share of total expenses.\par \par \uc2 While the Obama administration has said the federal insurance marketplace is gaining healthier, lower-cost consumers, several insurers said at the hearings that they had not seen a significant improvement.\par \par \uc2 ''Studies concluded that the market would stabilize after absorbing the pent-up demand from the previously uninsured population,'' testified \uc2 Eric Galvin\uc2 , the chief financial officer of ConnectiCare Insurance Company. But, he said, ''rather than stabilize, that cost has continued to skyrocket, and we see no end to that higher level of spending.''\par \par \uc2 Christopher F. Koller, a former health insurance commissioner in Rhode Island, said he was always concerned that insurers were seeking higher rates than necessary, with the expectation that their requests would be cut back by state regulators.\par \par \uc2 But even if officials trim proposed rates, consumers can still face substantial increases.\par \par \uc2 This month New York officials approved rate increases averaging 16.6 percent for individual health insurance plans in 2017, more than twice the average in the state for 2016.\par \par \uc2 The insurance commissioner in Mississippi approved an average rate increase of 43 percent for \uc2 Humana\uc2 , fearing that the company might otherwise leave the state's insurance exchange, as \uc2 UnitedHealth\uc2  intends to do.\par \par \uc2 And the Kentucky insurance commissioner has approved increases averaging 5.6 percent for \uc2 Aetna\uc2 , 22.9 percent for Anthem and 31 percent for \uc2 Humana\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Find out what you need to know about the 2016 presidential race today, and get politics news updates via \uc2 Facebook\uc2 , \uc2 Twitter\uc2  and the First Draft newsletter.\par \par \uc2 Document NYTF000020160815ec8f00050\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw272\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4080\pichgoal600

\par\par \b \uc2 Election\uc2  2016: Biden to Make Debut Campaign Appearance\b0\par\par\uc2 By Byron Tau   \par \uc2 372 \uc2 words\par \uc2 15 August 2016\par \uc2 The Wall Street Journal\par \uc2 J\par A4\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 Vice President \uc2 Joe Biden\uc2  will make his 2016 campaign-trail debut Monday in blue-collar Scranton, Pa., where he is expected to draw on his boyhood in northeastern Pennsylvania during a joint appearance with \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Mr. Biden and the Democratic presidential nominee are scheduled to appear in the predominantly white city of about 75,000, where both Democrats have family ties. The two initially planned to make a joint appearance last month in the economically struggling region, but the event was postponed after the shooting deaths of several police officers at a Dallas protest.\par \par \uc2 Known as the setting for NBC's comedy "The Office," Scranton is the kind of community that is expected to be at the center of the fight between Republican \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  and Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 . Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's path to the White House depends on winning big margins among white, working-class supporters to offset a major Democratic demographic advantage among nonwhites, especially in states like Ohio and Pennsylvania.\par \par \uc2 Scranton has long been solidly Democratic territory, but Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  hopes to change that, capitalizing on the region's economic stagnation and anger over illegal immigration. For Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , a key challenge will be to prevent further erosion of her support among working-class whites -- a likely reason Mr. Biden has been tapped to aid her.\par \par \uc2 The two Democrats will discuss their "shared commitment to building an America that is stronger together and an economy that works for everyone, not just those at the top," according to the \uc2 Clinton\uc2  campaign.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Biden was born in Scranton and has made his youth in the city a key part of his personal narrative.\par \par \uc2 When Scranton's coal and textile industries began to decline in the 1950s, Mr. Biden's father moved the family to Delaware. Mr. Biden would eventually go on to represent Delaware in the \uc2 U.S. Senate\uc2  for 36 years.\par \par \uc2 Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's father, Hugh Rodham, is also from the city, though she grew up in Illinois.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  made an appearance last month in Scranton, his third in the state since wrapping up the Republican nominating contests in June.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=wjco20160815000066"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document J000000020160815ec8f0001t\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw272\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4080\pichgoal600

\par\par \b \uc2 Election\uc2  2016: \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's College Plan Takes Backseat on Trail\b0\par\par\uc2 By Laura Meckler   \par \uc2 786 \uc2 words\par \uc2 15 August 2016\par \uc2 The Wall Street Journal\par \uc2 J\par A4\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , who prides herself on the details of public policy, has said little about what is now the most ambitious and expensive proposal on her agenda: making public college tuition free for most Americans.\par \par \uc2 On the campaign trail, she typically offers a sentence, maybe two, about the plan. Sometimes it goes unmentioned altogether. Her campaign has offered few specifics about how the program would work, hasn't said how much money states would have to provide or where the program would fall on her list of priorities.\par \par \uc2 The campaign website no longer lists a cost for the program, though campaign aides said they estimate it would take $500 billion in new federal spending over 10 years, $150 billion more than the college plan she put out last summer. Others estimate the costs would be much higher.\par \par \uc2 The sketchiness may owe something to the way the free-tuition plan came to be part of Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's platform. Rather than taking months or years to craft, like many of her other proposals, it was inserted as part of negotiations in July to win the backing of Democratic rival Sen. Bernie Sanders.\par \par \uc2 Lanae Erickson Hatalsky, who tracks higher education and other issues at the centrist Democratic think tank Third Way, said it was obvious that the plan was put together to win over Mr. Sanders.\par \par \uc2 Most of Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's policy proposals "are five pages of dense text with very specific ways of how they're going to pay for it and how much it would cost," she said. "This sounded much more like something intended to energize a campaign rally."\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 Clinton\uc2  plan still is more detailed than most of the ideas put forth by her opponent, Republican \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2 , who doesn't typically give the cost of his plans and sometimes changes significant planks. Still, Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  prides herself on her policy chops and says candidates owe it to voters to be clear about their plans. Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's campaign didn't respond to a request for comment.\par \par \uc2 Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  says she would pay for the college plan with higher taxes on the wealthy, including new limits on deductions. Campaign aides said that once school is back in session and younger voters are paying more attention, she would talk more about the college plan.\par \par \uc2 Clinton\uc2  spokesman Jesse Ferguson said Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  is "deeply committed" to the revised plan. "\uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  put forward an ambitious proposal in the primary and, after listening to voters on the campaign trail, expanded it to more effectively reach the goal of erasing the barrier of debt to a college of education," he said.\par \par \uc2 Passing this program into law will be a challenge, though, particularly if Republicans continue to control at least one house of Congress. Even some Democrats think Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's first proposal would have a better chance and worry that the revised version is too heavy a lift.\par \par \uc2 The new \uc2 Clinton\uc2  policy was described in a single paragraph issued by the campaign in early July amid talks with Mr. Sanders, who had campaigned against her in the primary on a more expansive free-tuition plan. His concept was that public colleges should be free for all, like public high schools.\par \par \uc2 Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  had already put forth a detailed plan last summer to assure that students could attend public colleges without borrowing money for tuition, but she said families should contribute what they could afford. To win over Mr. Sanders, Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  agreed that students in families earning $85,000 a year or less would be assured free tuition, with that threshold climbing to $125,000 over four years.\par \par \uc2 The political goals were clear. The policy was a priority for Mr. Sanders, and after her shift, he endorsed her. She also put herself in position to appeal to younger voters, who overwhelmingly backed Mr. Sanders in the primaries and are an important part of the coalition that twice elected President \uc2 Barack Obama\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 In his speech at July's Democratic convention endorsing Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , Mr. Sanders specifically cited this policy shift.\par \par \uc2 Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  had long described her plan, which she calls the New College Compact, as a balanced way of making sure all players have "skin in the game," including federal and state governments, universities, families and students.\par \par \uc2 Under her new plan, 80% of families would qualify for tuition-free school, even if they could afford some contribution. A \uc2 Clinton\uc2  aide noted that students are still expected to have a job that will help pay expenses, and said that it is most important that government pay its fair share.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=wjco20160815000065"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document J000000020160815ec8f0001s\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 EDITORIAL\par \uc2 Editorial Desk; SECTSR\par \b \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  Courts the Gun Zealots\b0\par\par\uc2 By THE EDITORIAL BOARD \par \uc2 756 \uc2 words\par \uc2 14 August 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 8\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 The mutual embrace of \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  and the \uc2 National Rifle Association\uc2  grew tighter last week with Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's incendiary suggestion that Second Amendment advocates could ''maybe'' find a way to deal with \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  and her gun safety agenda if she reached the White House.\par \par \uc2 Whether calculated or clumsy, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's ugly pronouncement left a whiff of lethal intimidation in the air. It marked a singular moment of desperation in his presidential campaign -- but also created grounds for the nation to demand a rational, substantive campaign debate on gun safety that gets beyond Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's inflammatory sound bites.\par \par \uc2 The N.R.A. stands almost alone now with Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , as one of his few remaining stalwarts in the Republican coalition. Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  cynically cast aside his earlier pro-gun-control position and successfully pandered this year for the group's endorsement during the primaries. And while Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  denies any intent to cue up gun-packing psychopaths, his new best friends in the N.R.A. have begun a $3 million TV attack campaign against Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 As a campaigner, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  largely ignores the epidemic of gun carnage that claims more than 30,000 lives in the United States each year, except to repeat N.R.A. bromides about the need for citizens to arm themselves. He would rather exaggerate the threat from foreign terrorists on our shores than talk about the far more lethal threat posed by disturbed Americans' easy access to battlefield-style weapons -- weapons profiting a gun industry that the group serves as a virtual marketing partner.\par \par \uc2 In contrast, Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  has chosen to defy past warnings that gun control and the N.R.A. are a politically lethal topic and has made the issue a centerpiece of her campaign. She offers a wide list of lifesaving proposals, including restoration of the assault weapons ban that Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  supported until he switched his position last March in a Republican presidential debate.\par \par \uc2 Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  has been asking voters to stand up to the gun lobby, a regressive political force that Republican politicians fearfully obey. Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  mouths vigilante nonsense about the necessity of being legally armed for the next gun spree. ''If I'm in that room and let's say we have two or five or 40 people with guns,'' he says. ''We're going to do a lot better because there's going to be a shootout.''\par \par \uc2 A shootout? Give us a break, as Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  likes to say. Far better that he muster the courage to engage in a detailed debate with Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  on precisely what to do about reining in guns, a national scourge. The coming TV debates must not allow him to dodge the subject with N.R.A. bluster.\par \par \uc2 Research shows the folly of the group's ''concealed carry'' campaign to arm millions of ordinary citizens in all manner of public venues, from college campuses to restaurants, churches and schools. Far from stopping mass shooters in their tracks, these gun owners have been shooting themselves, family members and others. Since 2007, concealed-carry handgun holders have been responsible for at least 873 deaths not involving self-defense, including 29 mass shootings and close to 300 suicides, according to the Violence Policy Center, a gun safety group. So much for Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's shootout option.\par \par \uc2 A dozen other aspects of gun safety need to be responsibly debated. Why should high-powered weapons devised for war ever be sold on the domestic market? Why can gun-show customers evade the federal background checks that other gun buyers must undergo? How can people on no-fly lists be free to buy guns? And as an often litigious businessman, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  surely has views on whether firearm makers truly deserve blanket protection from damage lawsuits, an extraordinary shield enjoyed by no other industry.\par \par \uc2 If Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  ducks the honest debate that voters deserve, they should keep in mind that the N.R.A. has as much riding on the \uc2 election\uc2  outcome as Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  does. A double opportunity is at hand. Rejection of Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  at the ballot box would also mean a decisive vote against the N.R.A. and the human destruction its agenda continues to inflict upon the nation.\par \par \uc2 Follow The \uc2 New York Times\uc2  Opinion section on \uc2 Facebook\uc2  and \uc2 Twitter\uc2  (@NYTOpinion), and sign up for the Opinion Today newsletter.\par \par \uc2 (PHOTOGRAPH BY JUN TAKAHASHI/GETTY IMAGES) DRAWING (DRAWING BY MERTO/WILLEY) \par \par \uc2 Document NYTF000020160818ec8e0000i\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 National Desk; SECTA\par \b \uc2 The Failing Inside Mission to Tame \uc2 Trump\uc2 's Tongue\b0\par\par\uc2 By ALEXANDER BURNS and MAGGIE HABERMAN \par \uc2 1,975 \uc2 words\par \uc2 14 August 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 1\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2  was in a state of shock: He had just fired his campaign manager and was watching the man discuss his dismissal at length on \uc2 CNN\uc2 . The rattled candidate's advisers and family seized the moment for an intervention.\par \par \uc2 Joined by his daughter Ivanka and her husband, \uc2 Jared Kushner\uc2 , a cluster of Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's confidants pleaded with him to make that day -- June 20 -- a turning point.\par \par \uc2 He would have to stick to a teleprompter and end his freestyle digressions and insults, like his repeated attacks on a Hispanic federal judge. \uc2 Paul Manafort\uc2 , Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's campaign chairman, and \uc2 Gov. Chris Christie\uc2  of New Jersey argued that Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  had an effective message, if only he would deliver it. For now, the campaign's polling showed, too many voters described him in two words: ''unqualified'' and ''racist.''\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  bowed to his team's entreaties, according to four people with detailed knowledge of the meeting, who described it on the condition of anonymity. It was time, he agreed, to get on track.\par \par \uc2 Nearly two months later, the effort to save Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  from himself has plainly failed. He has repeatedly signaled to his advisers and allies his willingness to change and adapt, but has grown only more volatile and prone to provocation since then, clashing with a Gold Star family, making comments that have been seen as inciting violence and linking his political opponents to terrorism.\par \par \uc2 Advisers who once hoped a Pygmalion-like transformation would refashion a crudely effective political showman into a plausible American president now increasingly concede that Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  may be beyond coaching. He has ignored their pleas and counsel as his poll numbers have dropped, boasting to friends about the size of his crowds and maintaining that he can read surveys better than the professionals.\par \par \uc2 In private, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's mood is often sullen and erratic, his associates say. He veers from barking at members of his staff to grumbling about how he was better off following his own instincts during the primaries and suggesting he should not have heeded their calls for change.\par \par \uc2 He broods about his souring relationship with the news media, calling Mr. Manafort several times a day to talk about specific stories. Occasionally, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  blows off steam in bursts of boyish exuberance: At the end of a fund-raiser on Long Island last week, he playfully buzzed the crowd twice with his helicopter.\par \par \uc2 But in interviews with more than 20 Republicans who are close to Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  or in communication with his campaign, many of whom insisted on anonymity to avoid clashing with him, they described their nominee as exhausted, frustrated and still bewildered by fine points of the political process and why his incendiary approach seems to be sputtering.\par \par \uc2 He is routinely preoccupied with perceived slights, for example raging to aides after Senator \uc2 Marco Rubio\uc2  of Florida, in his re-\uc2 election\uc2  announcement, said he would stand up to the next president regardless of party. In a visit to Capitol Hill in early July, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  bickered with two Republican senators who had not endorsed him; he needled Representative Peter T. King of New York for having taken donations from him over the years only to criticize him on television now.\par \par \uc2 And Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  has begun to acknowledge to associates and even in public that he might lose. In an interview on CNBC on Thursday, he said he was prepared to face defeat.\par \par \uc2 ''I'll just keep doing the same thing I'm doing right now,'' he said. ''And at the end, it's either going to work, or I'm going to, you know, I'm going to have a very, very nice, long vacation.''\par \par \uc2 Jason Miller, a spokesman for Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , said the Republican nominee was still determined to win, and dismissed accounts that he was downcast. Mr. Miller pointed to the crowds Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  attracts as a sign of strength.\par \par \uc2 ''Behind the scenes we have a very motivated and very focused candidate in \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2 , who knows what he needs to do to win this race,'' Mr. Miller said.\par \par \uc2 People around Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  and his operation say they are not ready to abandon hope of a turnaround. But he is in a dire predicament, Republicans say, because he is profoundly uncomfortable in the role of a typical general \uc2 election\uc2  candidate, disoriented by the crosscurrents he must now navigate and still relying impulsively on a pugilistic formula that guided him to the nomination.\par \par \uc2 His advisers are still convinced of the basic potency of a sales pitch about economic growth and a shake-up in Washington, and they aspire to compete in as many as 21 states, despite Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's perilous standing in the four states -- Florida, Ohio, Pennsylvania and North Carolina -- likely to decide the \uc2 election\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Charles R. Black Jr., an influential Republican lobbyist supporting Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , said the campaign was in a continuing struggle to tame him.\par \par \uc2 ''He has three or four good days and then makes another gaffe,'' Mr. Black said. ''Hopefully, he can have some more good days.'' Of Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's advisers, Mr. Black said, ''They think he is making progress in terms of being able to make set speeches and not take the bait on every attack somebody makes on him.''\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's advisers now hope to steady him by pairing him on the trail with familiar, more seasoned figures -- people he views as peers and enjoys spending time with, like former Mayor \uc2 Rudolph W. Giuliani\uc2  of New York and former Gov. Mike Huckabee of Arkansas.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Giuliani, who campaigned with Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  early in the week, said he did not see the candidate as unmoored or unhappy. If anyone was disconcerted, Mr. Giuliani suggested, it was the people steering his campaign.\par \par \uc2 ''He doesn't seem to be as unnerved by these things that go wrong as the people around him,'' Mr. Giuliani said. Still, he allowed, ''I think it is true that maybe it took him a little while to realize that we're moving from a primary campaign to a presidential campaign.''\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , he said, had become ''a little bit more realizing there are certain days left and you've got to get messages out on those days.''\par \par \uc2 Even before Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's most recent spate of incendiary comments, Republicans who dealt with him after the primaries came away alarmed by his obvious unease as the de facto party leader. After a meeting in late May between Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  and Karl Rove, the architect of George W. Bush's presidential victories, Mr. Rove told associates he was stunned by Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's poor grasp of campaign basics, including how to map out a schedule and use data to reach voters.\par \par \uc2 Sitting with Mr. Rove in the Manhattan apartment of a mutual friend, the casino magnate Steve Wynn, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  said he would compete in states like Oregon, which has not voted Republican since Ronald Reagan's 1984 landslide. Mr. Rove later told people he believed Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  was confused and scared in anticipation of the general \uc2 election\uc2 , according to people who have heard Mr. Rove's account.\par \par \uc2 A few weeks later, when \uc2 Gov. Chris Christie\uc2  of New Jersey brokered a meeting at \uc2 Trump\uc2  Tower between Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  and governors from around the country, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  offered a desultory performance, bragging about his poll numbers, listening passively as the governors talked about their states and then sending them on their way.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  never asked them for their support, three people briefed on the meeting said.\par \par \uc2 With donors, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  has been an indifferent ambassador for his campaign. He has resisted making fund-raising calls and, during at least two major events in July, in New York and Chicago, burned valuable hours with potential contributors by asking them to go around the room, one by one, giving him their thoughts on whom he should pick as his running mate.\par \par \uc2 That left little time for the donors to query Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  about policy or strategy, or for him to reassure them about his campaign. Jay Bergman, an Illinois oil executive who attended the event in Chicago, said he wondered if Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  had taken that approach ''to avoid answering questions.''\par \par \uc2 On matters of policy, too, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  has engaged only fleetingly, and idiosyncratically. Before delivering a policy speech in Detroit on Monday, he delegated the formation of an economic plan to a few conservative economists outside his campaign, who consulted him from time to time and ultimately haggled over the details in his office as he followed their conversation.\par \par \uc2 Stephen Moore, a \uc2 Heritage Foundation\uc2  fellow, said he and Arthur Laffer, the supply-side economist, had tangled over the top tax bracket while Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  observed from behind his desk, eventually siding with Mr. Moore. Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , he said, also expressed strong views about the taxation of interest on business loans, citing his experience as a developer.\par \par \uc2 ''He's a typical businessman, right?'' Mr. Moore said. ''He lets people argue it out, and Arthur made his case and others made their case.''\par \par \uc2 ''He's not the world's expert on the tax code,'' Mr. Moore added, ''but he has very good intuition about how these things will affect real people.''\par \par \uc2 At the last minute, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  interjected to direct his advisers to incorporate a tax deduction for the cost of child care in his economic plan. The issue, which Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  had not discussed on the campaign trail, is a favorite of his daughter Ivanka.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's reliance on his family has only grown more pronounced. Mr. Kushner, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's son-in-law, who has no background in politics, has expanded his role: He now has broad oversight over areas including the campaign's budget, messaging and strategy, with the power to approve spending. Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  has also continued to seek advice from \uc2 Corey Lewandowski\uc2 , the campaign manager whom Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  ousted in June at his children's urging.\par \par \uc2 Efforts to bring in high-profile, experienced hands have been fruitless. Mr. Kushner had suggested enlisting \uc2 Steve Schmidt\uc2 , Senator \uc2 John McCain\uc2 's 2008 presidential campaign manager, but despite having met once with Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  during the primaries and speaking with him a few times, Mr. Schmidt never signed on.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's advisers believe he is nearly out of time to right his campaign. On Tuesday, hours before his explosive comment about ''Second Amendment people'' taking action if Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  is elected, his brain trust reassembled again at \uc2 Trump\uc2  Tower in a reprise of their stern meeting in June.\par \par \uc2 They again urged Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  to adjust his tone and comportment. The top pollster, Tony Fabrizio, gave an unvarnished assessment, warning that Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's numbers would only move in one direction, absent a major change.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , people briefed on the meeting said, digested the advice and responded receptively.\par \par \uc2 It was time, he agreed, to get on track.\par \par \uc2 Find out what you need to know about the 2016 presidential race today, and get politics news updates via \uc2 Facebook\uc2 , \uc2 Twitter\uc2  and the First Draft newsletter.\par \par \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2  at a rally in Altoona, Pa., on Friday.

SHEAR \par \uc2 3,784 \uc2 words\par \uc2 14 August 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 1\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 WASHINGTON -- In nearly eight years in office, President \uc2 Obama\uc2  has sought to reshape the nation with a sweeping assertion of executive authority and a canon of regulations that have inserted the United States government more deeply into American life.\par \par \uc2 Once a presidential candidate with deep misgivings about executive power, \uc2 Mr. Obama\uc2  will leave the White House as one of the most prolific authors of major regulations in presidential history.\par \par \uc2 Blocked for most of his presidency by Congress, \uc2 Mr. Obama\uc2  has sought to act however he could. In the process he created the kind of government neither he nor the Republicans wanted -- one that depended on bureaucratic bulldozing rather than legislative transparency. But once \uc2 Mr. Obama\uc2  got the taste for it, he pursued his executive power without apology, and in ways that will shape the presidency for decades to come.\par \par \uc2 The Obama administration in its first seven years finalized 560 major regulations -- those classified by the \uc2 Congressional Budget Office\uc2  as having particularly significant economic or social impacts. That was nearly 50 percent more than the George W. Bush administration during the comparable period, according to data kept by the regulatory studies center at \uc2 George Washington University\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 An army of lawyers working under \uc2 Mr. Obama\uc2 's authority has sought to restructure the nation's health care and financial industries, limit pollution, bolster workplace protections and extend equal rights to minorities. Under \uc2 Mr. Obama\uc2 , the government has literally placed a higher value on human life.\par \par \uc2 And it has imposed billions of dollars in new costs on businesses and consumers.\par \par \uc2 Many of the new rules are little known, even as they affect the way Americans eat, love and die. People can dine on genetically engineered salmon. Women can buy emergency contraceptive pills without prescriptions. Military veterans can design their own headstones.\par \par \uc2 In its final year, the administration is enacting some of its most ambitious rules, including limits on airborne silica at job sites, an overhaul of food labels to clarify nutritional information, and a measure making millions of workers eligible for overtime pay.\par \par \uc2 The administration's regulatory legacy has become an issue in the campaign to replace \uc2 Mr. Obama\uc2 , as \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2  has sharply criticized regulatory overreach and promised to undo many of the new rules. But executive power has expanded steadily under both Republican and Democratic presidents in recent decades, and both Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  and \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  have promised to act in the service of their own goals.\par \par \uc2 The new rules built on the legislative victories \uc2 Mr. Obama\uc2  won during his first two years in office. Those laws -- the Affordable Care Act, the Dodd-Frank Act and the $800 billion economic stimulus package -- transformed the nation's health care system, curbed the ambitions of the big banks and injected financial support into a creaky economy. But as Republicans increased their control of Capitol Hill, \uc2 Mr. Obama\uc2 's deep frustration with congressional opposition led to a new approach: He gradually embraced a president's power to act unilaterally.\par \par \uc2 History may now judge the regulations to be one of \uc2 Mr. Obama\uc2 's most enduring legacies. At the least, his exercise of administrative power expanded and cemented a domestic legacy that now rivals Lyndon B. Johnson's Great Society in reach and scope.\par \par \uc2 In May, \uc2 Mr. Obama\uc2  was asked by a farmer in Elkhart, Ind., to justify the ''dramatic increase'' in government regulations that affected his business. ''I'm not interested in regulating just for the sake of regulating,'' \uc2 Mr. Obama\uc2  responded. ''But there are some things like making sure we've got clean air and clean water, making sure that folks have health insurance, making sure that worker safety is a priority -- that, I do think, is part of our overall obligation.''\par \par \uc2 Infuriated Republicans describe many of the new rules as unwarranted, resulting in ''less jobs, less businesses, less prosperity, lower take-home pay,'' in the words of the House speaker, Paul D. Ryan. Business groups, also incensed, have challenged a number of new regulations in court, delaying them or preventing them from taking effect. Some economic experts worry that the accumulation of regulation is contributing to the economy's persistent sluggishness.\par \par \uc2 ''The big issue that I grapple with is that the regulatory state keeps growing,'' said Robert Hahn, an economist and a regulatory expert at the Smith School at the \uc2 University of Oxford\uc2 . ''And as it keeps growing, when does it become too much?''\par \par \uc2 Not Inherently a Regulator\par \par \uc2 Mr. Obama\uc2  entered office in January 2009 determined to make his mark by passing bold new laws, not by tinkering with rules. \uc2 Rahm Emanuel\uc2 , his first chief of staff, and other top aides mapped out an ambitious two-year agenda that included a health care overhaul, new banking laws, a remake of the federal student loan program, infrastructure spending and stricter limits on pollution.\par \par \uc2 The new president had a skeptical streak when it came to the value of regulation, influenced by his friend Cass R. Sunstein, a Harvard Law professor who had long argued that the government should more rigorously assess the benefits of new regulations. \uc2 Mr. Obama\uc2  liked that idea so much that he named Mr. Sunstein to lead the White House office that oversees rule-making.\par \par \uc2 ''The president is not somebody who is intuitively or inherently a regulator,'' said Howard Shelanski, who followed Mr. Sunstein in that role in mid-2013. He said \uc2 Mr. Obama\uc2  conveyed a simple message: '''If we can get a good result without regulating, let's do that.'''\par \par \uc2 But after eight years of a Republican administration, many Democrats were eager for the government to lean more forcefully on the levers of regulatory power, and officials within the federal bureaucracy felt emboldened.\par \par \uc2 The White House did resist some ideas. It shut down efforts by Lisa Jackson, \uc2 Mr. Obama\uc2 's first administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, to increase the regulation of ozone, a decision that environmentalists viewed as a betrayal.\par \par \uc2 But other rules were allowed to proceed. Kate Hanni, an advocate from Napa, Calif., for the rights of airline passengers, had tried for years to persuade the government to address a series of incidents in which flight delays left passengers trapped for hours on planes that had already left the gate, often in cabins with stinking toilets, weak air-conditioning and no food. The Bush administration put Ms. Hanni on a task force consisting mostly of airline executives, which concluded in the fall of 2008 -- over her forceful and repeated objections -- that the public was best served by allowing the airlines to make their own decisions.\par \par \uc2 Weeks after the task force released its report, Ms. Hanni was invited to Washington in December 2008 to meet with Robert S. Rivkin, the head of \uc2 Mr. Obama\uc2 's transportation transition team. Democrats in Congress had introduced legislation to address the issue, but Mr. Rivkin asked Ms. Hanni if she would support new regulations instead. She would back anything enforceable, Ms. Hanni said.\par \par \uc2 ''Right answer,'' he replied.\par \par \uc2 Over the course of the next nine months, Mr. Rivkin and his team of career regulators at the Department of Transportation developed rules prohibiting planes loaded with passengers from sitting on the tarmac for more than three hours.\par \par \uc2 In meetings with Ray LaHood, \uc2 Mr. Obama\uc2 's first transportation secretary, and his staff, airline representatives argued for flexibility, saying rigid timelines would only increase flight cancellations. They chafed at the regulators' willingness to see the benefits but not the costs.\par \par \uc2 Sharon L. Pinkerton\uc2 , an executive at \uc2 Airlines for America\uc2 , the industry's main trade group, recalled Transportation Department regulators suggesting that ''unquantifiable, unidentifiable benefits'' would ''outweigh the costs'' of new rules for the airlines.\par \par \uc2 ''What are we supposed to do with that?'' she asked later in an interview.\par \par \uc2 But Mr. LaHood had himself experienced long waits on the runway during frequent trips home to Illinois. Just days before Christmas in 2009, he announced a Passenger Bill of Rights, which for the first time levied fines of up to $27,500 per passenger on airlines that leave domestic flights stranded for more than three hours. He challenged the major carriers to provide their service ''in a way that is halfway convenient'' for their customers.\par \par \uc2 His department, Mr. LaHood said in a recent interview, had a new sense of purpose, independent of any specific directive from the White House.\par \par \uc2 ''They had other fish to fry,'' Mr. LaHood said of senior officials at the White House. ''We didn't want to wait around for Congress to take five, 10 years to do this. We could do this by rule and regulation, so we were pretty much off to the races.''\par \par \uc2 Other agencies were moving too. In its second year, bureaucrats working across the government completed 96 major rules, more than in any subsequent year.\par \par \uc2 Equal Rights for Everyone\par \par \uc2 The White House soon began to take a greater interest in regulation.\par \par \uc2 In May 2009, Mr. Emanuel raised concerns about Janice Langbehn, a social worker featured in The \uc2 New York Times\uc2  who was barred from visiting her hospitalized same-sex partner.\par \par \uc2 Passing legislation to address the problem was unlikely, Mr. Emanuel knew, given entrenched ideological opposition and the White House's focus on overhauling the health insurance system. But \uc2 Nancy-Ann DeParle\uc2 , director of the newly created Office of Health Reform, suggested an alternative: The administration had the power to impose conditions on hospitals that got federal Medicare funding.\par \par \uc2 A year later, the president directed the \uc2 Department of Health and Human Services\uc2  to develop regulations requiring hospitals to extend visitation rights to same-sex partners.\par \par \uc2 ''All too often, people are made to suffer or even to pass away alone, denied the comfort of companionship in their final moments while a loved one is left worrying and pacing down the hall,'' \uc2 Mr. Obama\uc2  wrote in an April 2010 memo.\par \par \uc2 A focus on similar issues produced more than 100 executive actions and regulatory changes intended to improve the lives of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people, particularly after the Supreme Court in 2013 struck down the federal law that defined marriage as between a man and a woman.\par \par \uc2 People with H.I.V. were no longer barred from entry into the country; federal housing rules recognized lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender families; health insurance companies were barred from discriminating against gay people; labor protections applied to gay couples; married same-sex couples could take family and medical leave; and the \uc2 Internal Revenue Service\uc2  started treating same-sex couples no differently.\par \par \uc2 ''These are really lasting things,'' said \uc2 David Stacy\uc2 , the government affairs director for the Human Rights Campaign, a gay rights advocacy organization. ''They affect people in their everyday lives.''\par \par \uc2 The Value of Regulation\par \par \uc2 As the Obama administration turned toward regulation, it sought to strengthen its hand by changing the estimates of what a life is worth. Those estimates allowed the administration to argue that the benefits of many regulations were greater than previously appreciated. This push was particularly important as a justification for stronger environmental protections.\par \par \uc2 A White House push to pass a sweeping climate change bill in 2009 failed to pass in Congress, but almost from the outset some of \uc2 Mr. Obama\uc2 's aides were working on a Plan B. Mr. Sunstein and Michael Greenstone, the first head of \uc2 Mr. Obama\uc2 's Council of Economic Advisers, created an internal task force to put a dollar figure on the cost of carbon emissions.\par \par \uc2 The government does not try to quantify all the benefits of proposed regulations. When it came to environmental regulations, the calculation was particularly limited. Analysts often assigned a dollar figure to just one kind of damage -- emissions of ''small particles'' -- and then stacked up the costs of the proposal against the benefits of fewer particles.\par \par \uc2 Quantifying a second kind of damage, from carbon emissions, would broaden the assessed benefits of new regulations -- potentially justifying new and stronger restrictions. In 2010, the administration issued a report that estimated the economic impact of global warming, including agricultural disruptions, increased flooding and health problems. It pegged the cost of carbon emissions at $21 per ton. An updated assessment in 2013 raised the price tag to $33.\par \par \uc2 When the administration announced stricter standards for automobile fuel efficiency in 2011, it cited the reduction in carbon emissions as a key benefit. Those benefits have since been cited in several dozen new regulations, including the hotly debated 2015 rule seeking to restrict emissions from new power plants.\par \par \uc2 Regulators also revisited a more fundamental concept: the value of life. Not just a theological or philosophical abstraction, that figure is used to assess how much spending the government should require to prevent death or injury.\par \par \uc2 The Department of Transportation, for example, increased the estimated value of preventing one death from $6.6 million in 2009 to $9.4 million last year, adjusting for inflation. The department made an even larger adjustment for preventing injuries, for example raising the value of averting a broken arm from $103,000 in 2009 to $442,000 in 2015, also adjusting for inflation. The increases have helped to justify new requirements for stronger roofs and rearview cameras on automobiles and seatbelts on buses.\par \par \uc2 The new carbon cost estimate, in particular, has drawn fire from industry groups who regard it as an arbitrary assessment intended to further an environmental agenda.\par \par \uc2 Environmentalists, however, argue that the government is still significantly understating the actual impact. A 2014 analysis by economists at \uc2 Stanford University\uc2 , published in the science journal Nature, estimated that the cost of carbon was actually $220 per ton, far above the government's official estimate.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Greenstone, in a recent interview, defended the government's number as a result of a technocratic process that was not influenced by political pressures.\par \par \uc2 ''Our job as faceless bureaucrats sitting in windowless rooms was not to do science but to summarize the frontier of science,'' he said. '' And I feel that we were faithful to that.''\par \par \uc2 The Room Where It Happens\par \par \uc2 By the fall of 2011, after a summer standoff between the two political parties nearly caused a government shutdown, it was clear to \uc2 Mr. Obama\uc2  that little hope remained for moving his agenda forward in a Congress controlled by Republicans.\par \par \uc2 Speaking in Las Vegas that October, \uc2 Mr. Obama\uc2  expressed disdain for ''an increasingly dysfunctional Congress'' and pledged: ''Where they won't act, I will.''\par \par \uc2 That sentiment kicked off a slow-moving realignment as White House officials held a series of strategy meetings that fall in the Roosevelt Room, first with \uc2 Mr. Obama\uc2  on Saturdays and later with agency and policy experts, usually on Tuesdays and Fridays. Led by Ms. DeParle, who had become deputy chief of staff, and Dan Pfeiffer, the communications director, they asked: What can we do without Congress?\par \par \uc2 ''It's certainly true that we learned by about the third year that the answer to every challenge isn't going to be legislative,'' said \uc2 Cecilia Mu\u241\'00\'F1oz\uc2 , now director of \uc2 Mr. Obama\uc2 's Domestic Policy Council.\par \par \uc2 The pace of regulation stalled somewhat in 2012, amid political concerns about announcing sweeping new regulations during the campaign. In 2013, \uc2 Mr. Obama\uc2 's team briefly hoped his victory would lead to legislative progress, but Republicans blocked gun control measures and an immigration overhaul, and partisan gridlock shut the government down for 15 days that October.\par \par \uc2 In early 2014, the moment was finally ripe. \uc2 Mr. Obama\uc2  recruited \uc2 John D. Podesta\uc2 , then the head of the \uc2 Center for American Progress\uc2 , a liberal research and policy institution, to be his counselor in the White House\par \par \uc2 ''The weight, if you will, changed with a very recalcitrant Republican House, and with both the House and the Senate being part of the 'Nyet!' caucus,'' Mr. Podesta said. ''It meant that you had to be seriously concerned with trying to make change happen with the tools that you had available.''\par \par \uc2 A Year of Action\par \par \uc2 In January 2014 a frustrated president stood before Congress and declared ''a year of action'' -- with or without the help of the Republicans arrayed before him.\par \par \uc2 ''Whenever I can take steps without legislation to expand opportunity for more American families, that's what I'm going to do,'' \uc2 Mr. Obama\uc2  said in his State of the Union address.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Obama\uc2  announced an executive order raising the minimum wage to $10.10 an hour for several hundred thousand cooks, janitors and other federal contract workers. In subsequent orders, each resulting in a new regulation, the president required contractors to let their workers take paid sick days and banned discrimination against lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender workers. He also increased workplace protections for all workers at businesses that held federal contracts -- an umbrella covering roughly 29 million workers.\par \par \uc2 ''What the president was ultimately doing was holding up the United States government as a model employer,'' said Joseph Geevarghese, director of Good Jobs Nation, a union-backed advocacy group that pressed the administration to embrace its regulatory power. ''And it created a ripple effect. Within months of the president acting you had private C.E.O.s -- \uc2 Ikea\uc2 , Gap, \uc2 Disney\uc2 , airlines -- saying they too were going to boost minimum pay.''\par \par \uc2 The new regulations again required the White House to broaden its assessment of regulatory benefits. During \uc2 Mr. Obama\uc2 's first term, administration officials told Mr. Geevarghese and other activists that the government did not have the power to make such changes. But after \uc2 Mr. Obama\uc2 's re-\uc2 election\uc2 , they found a way: White House lawyers concluded that the president could impose requirements on contractors in the interest of taxpayers.\par \par \uc2 Betsey Stevenson, a member of the president's Council of Economic Advisers, took the lead in building a case that contractors who paid higher wages would attract and retain better workers, increasing their productivity.\par \par \uc2 The theory holds, for example, that if the lunch lines at a federal office building moved a little more quickly because of more competent, motivated cafeteria workers, every employee in those lines would save a few minutes a day and have more time to work, thus increasing productivity.\par \par \uc2 The idea has its roots in work by George Akerlof, a Nobel Prize-winning economist, and his wife, \uc2 Janet Yellen\uc2 , now chairwoman of the Federal Reserve, who decided in the early 1980s to pay their babysitter above-market wages as motivation.\par \par \uc2 With the president's blessing, the E.P.A. also became more aggressive. The agency asserted federal authority to protect thousands of waterways and wetlands, proposed to cap carbon emissions at new and existing power plants, raised emissions standards for trucks and airplanes, and called for new limits on methane, mercury and ozone.\par \par \uc2 ''He has been much more ambitious and aggressive on environmental regulation than any other president we've had,'' said \uc2 Jeffrey Holmstead\uc2 , a lawyer pursuing legal challenges to some of \uc2 Mr. Obama\uc2 's signature environmental rules.\par \par \uc2 Courts have now temporarily blocked the administration's water rules and delayed the power plant limits on carbon dioxide emissions. The next administration will also have considerable leeway to determine how quickly new rules are carried out, and how strictly enforced.\par \par \uc2 The Next White House\par \par \uc2 Every president promises to prune the federal rule book.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Obama\uc2  has tried to formalize the process for reviewing existing regulations, and the two candidates vying to take his place, \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  and \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , have nodded at the need to ease the burdens of regulation.\par \par \uc2 But the scope of federal regulation has continued to grow, and the trend is likely to continue. Presidents, both Democratic and Republican, have asserted greater power in recent decades to dictate the shape of regulations, while Congress has become less specific in its instructions.\par \par \uc2 ''We live in an era of presidential administration,'' \uc2 Elena Kagan\uc2 , a Harvard law professor since appointed by \uc2 Mr. Obama\uc2  to the Supreme Court, wrote in a 2001 paper that reviewed the expansion of the regulatory state.\par \par \uc2 Both Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  and Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  would most likely face significant congressional opposition to their major campaign promises. To sidestep Congress, they now have the legacy of \uc2 Mr. Obama\uc2 . Mr. Podesta, now Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's campaign chairman, said the appeal of taking action without Congress is hard to resist.\par \par \uc2 ''You come in with a strategy of going to the Hill, certainly where you can find some cooperation,'' Mr. Podesta said. But when that fails, writing regulations ''is a way to get much more substantial throw-weight behind solving the problem.''\par \par \uc2 GAY RIGHTS: More than 100 executive actions and regulatory changes.

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 In my old workplace, right next to the comfortable couches where we would take breaks, we kept a voting machine. Instead of using the screen to pick our preferred candidate, we played Pac-Man. We sent Pac-Man's familiar yellow chomping face after digital ghosts with the same kind of machine that had been used in 2008 in more than 160 jurisdictions with about nine million registered voters.\par \par \uc2 This was at the Center for Information Technology Policy at \uc2 Princeton University\uc2 , where researchers had been able to reprogram the voting machine without even breaking the ''tamper evident'' seals.\par \par \uc2 Voting isn't a game, of course, and we need to trust the machines that count our votes. Especially this year. \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , the Republican presidential nominee, raised the possibility of ''rigged'' elections, and his former adviser Roger J. Stone Jr. has warned of a ''blood bath'' in such a case. A recent poll found that 34 percent of likely voters believed the general \uc2 election\uc2  would be rigged.\par \par \uc2 It's unclear what mechanism the \uc2 Trump\uc2  campaign envisions for this rigging. Voter fraud through impersonation or illegal voting is vanishingly rare in the United States, and rigging the \uc2 election\uc2  by tampering with voting machines would be nearly impossible. As President Obama pointed out in a news conference last week, where he called charges of electoral rigging ''ridiculous,'' states and cities set up voting systems, not the federal government. That's true, and it means the voting machine landscape is a patchwork of different systems, which makes the \uc2 election\uc2  hard to manipulate in a coordinated way.\par \par \uc2 But it's still a bleak landscape.\par \par \uc2 Over the years, the team at Princeton, cooperating with other researchers, has managed to disable and tamper with many direct recording electronic systems that use touch-screen computers without a verifiable paper trail.\par \par \uc2 I'm not the only one who is worried. This month, Jeh Johnson, the secretary of Homeland Security, said his department was concerned about infiltration of the nation's electoral systems. Experts have warned about voting machine vulnerability for years, but nothing has changed.\par \par \uc2 The mere existence of this discussion is cause for alarm. The United States needs to return, as soon as possible, to a paper-based, auditable voting system in all jurisdictions that still use electronic-only, unverifiable voting machines.\par \par \uc2 I study the impact of technology for a living, and I'm a former programmer. I happily bank online, and use my smartphone to message friends and family. I support and trust encryption to protect ordinary people's communication. I even believe computers will probably turn out to be safer drivers than too-easily distracted humans. I'm not averse to technological solutions.\par \par \uc2 In this case, though, we need to stick with methods that allow a paper trail that is verifiable after the \uc2 election\uc2 . No matter how you vote, there should be a tightly guarded paper record that can be used for audits, if not for the initial counting. This is not just because paper verification is more tamper-resistant than our insecure voting machines. Our elections need to be open to oversight without the need for voters to understand how encryption works. We can't tell them to simply trust the experts, especially when people are deliberately sowing distrust.\par \par \uc2 There is another upside to relying on paper. Audits of such systems can require something else that, at first glance, seems like a hindrance: People need to show up to do them. As the ''hanging chads'' debacle in Florida demonstrated in the 2000 \uc2 election\uc2 , paper systems, too, can be badly designed. However, in a healthy democracy, requiring people to show up is a good thing.\par \par \uc2 There are already minefields ahead for this \uc2 election\uc2 . Georgia, for example, relies on electronic systems that leave no paper trail. The machines in Georgia are also quite old, and a Brennan Center for Justice report found that their software was ''outdated'' -- primarily using operating systems like Windows 2000. This not only puts them at risk for crashes and lost votes, but also leaves them more vulnerable to hacking, as such older software no longer receives fixes for security flaws.\par \par \uc2 Since 1996, Georgia has voted for the Republican candidate in presidential elections, but this year a batch of recent polls have painted a tight race -- with some polls even indicating that the Democratic nominee, \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , may have an edge. If the race is close, and the outcome questioned, voters in Georgia will have no means to audit the results. Other potential swing states, like Pennsylvania and North Carolina, also use electronic machines with no paper trail, at least in some counties. According to the nonprofit Verified Voting, people in at least a dozen states could encounter that same situation.\par \par \uc2 We have also seen concerns about foreign nations meddling directly in United States elections, via hacking or other means. This is an unlikely scenario; however, the fact that people are even voicing such concerns makes it all the more urgent to dispel them. As Matthew Green, a professor at Johns Hopkins University who specializes in cryptography and cybersecurity, said, ''There is only one way to protect the voting system from a nation-state funded cyberattack: Use paper.''\par \par \uc2 Fortunately, there is a reliable and transparent method that combines convenience and the ability to perform an audit: paper ballot systems with optical scan counting. Avi Rubin, an expert on \uc2 election\uc2  security who is also a professor at Johns Hopkins, testified about a decade ago that when properly put into effect, these systems have many advantages. People can keep voting even if the equipment fails; it's possible to audit results; and the systems are easy to use.\par \par \uc2 It is too late to fix everything for this \uc2 election\uc2 . But we should start planning to verify and audit voting wherever possible. For jurisdictions that still use electronic-only voting, we need to guard the machines, to avoid the kind of direct tampering that can turn them into Pac-Man consoles. Randomly selected units should also be used as ''test only'' machines on \uc2 Election\uc2  Day, to check that they are tallying the votes correctly.\par \par \uc2 States like Georgia that need to replace their creaky machines should use this opportunity to switch to optical-scan ballots -- and, when necessary, jurisdictions should receive federal aid to upgrade to systems that include a verifiable paper trail.\par \par \uc2 Campaigns spend a great deal of effort to get people to vote. We need to do more to make sure that nobody can cast doubt that everyone's vote is counted.\par \par \uc2 Follow The \uc2 New York Times\uc2  Opinion section on \uc2 Facebook\uc2  and \uc2 Twitter\uc2  (@NYTopinion), and sign up for the Opinion Today newsletter.\par \par \uc2 Zeynep Tufekci is an associate professor at the University of North Carolina School of Information and Library Science and a contributing opinion writer.\par \par \uc2 DRAWING (DRAWING BY RYAN PELTIER) \par \par \uc2 Document NYTF000020160814ec8e0009q\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 FOREST GROVE, Ore. -- ALL across America, in little towns like this one, \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  is mainstreaming hate.\par \par \uc2 This community of Forest Grove, near the farm where I grew up in western Oregon, has historically been a charming, friendly and welcoming community. But in the middle of a physics class at the high school one day this spring, a group of white students suddenly began jeering at their Latino classmates and chanting: ''Build a wall! Build a wall!''\par \par \uc2 The same white students had earlier chanted ''\uc2 Trump\uc2 ! \uc2 Trump\uc2 ! \uc2 Trump\uc2 !'' Soon afterward, a student hung a homemade banner in the school reading, ''Build a Wall,'' prompting Latinos at area schools to stage a walkout.\par \par \uc2 ''They openly express their dislike of my race,'' Briana Larios, a 15-year-old Mexican-American honor roll student who hopes to go to Harvard, said of some of her white classmates. Wounded by accusations that she doesn't belong in the country in which she was born, Briana is thinking of being home-schooled rather than returning to the high school when classes resume.\par \par \uc2 ''People now feel that it is O.K. to say things that they might not have said a year ago,'' she said. ''\uc2 Trump\uc2  played a big role.''\par \par \uc2 Among any nation's most precious possessions is its social fabric, and that is what \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  is rending with incendiary talk about roughing up protesters and about gun owners solving the problem of \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  making judicial nominations.\par \par \uc2 Trump\uc2  only mildly distanced himself when an adviser suggested that \uc2 Clinton\uc2  should be executed by firing squad for treason, and his rallies have become toxic brews of hatred with shouts like ''Hang the bitch!'' The Times made a video of \uc2 Trump\uc2  fans at his rallies directing crude slurs not just at \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , but also at blacks, Latinos, Muslims and gay people.\par \par \uc2 We need not be apocalyptic about it. This is not Kristallnacht. But \uc2 Trump\uc2 's harsh rhetoric tears away the veneer of civility and betrays our national motto of ''e pluribus unum.'' He has unleashed a beast and fed its hunger, and long after this campaign is over we will be struggling to corral it again.\par \par \uc2 ''We've spent the last 15 years fighting bullying in schools, and the example set by the \uc2 Trump\uc2  campaign has broken down the doors, and a tidal wave of bullying has come through,'' said \uc2 Maureen Costello\uc2  of the \uc2 Southern Poverty Law Center\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 The center issued a report documenting how \uc2 Trump\uc2 's venom has poisoned schools across the country. It quoted a North Carolina teacher as saying she has ''Latino students who carry their birth certificates and Social Security cards to school because they are afraid they will be deported.'' Another teacher reported that a fifth grader told a Muslim student ''that he was supporting \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  because he was going to kill all of the Muslims if he became president!''\par \par \uc2 Here in the Forest Grove area, west of Portland, students of Mexican heritage at four high schools -- most of them born in the United States -- described to me how some local whites take cues from \uc2 Trump\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 ''They say, 'We're going to deport your ass,''' said Melina McGlothen, 17, whose mother is Mexican. ''I don't want to say I hate them, but I hate their stupidity.''\par \par \uc2 Ana Sally Gonzalez, 17, said a school club had put up posters criticizing racism, and they were then marred by graffiti such as ''Go back where you came from'' and ''\uc2 Trump\uc2  2016.''\par \par \uc2 The tension reflects deep resentment among some white working-class families. They are angry at immigrants who have taken over some jobs, at the way communities they cherish are changing demographically and linguistically, and at what they perceive as a stifling political correctness that leaves whites accused of racism when they speak up.\par \par \uc2 Many of my old Oregon farm-town friends are strong \uc2 Trump\uc2  supporters, and they will completely disagree with this column. Their headline would be, ''Big Media Suffocates Real Americans With Political Correctness.''\par \par \uc2 The upshot is that this \uc2 election\uc2  year, we're divided not only by political party and ideology, but also by identity. So the weave of our national fabric unravels. And while our eyes have mostly been on \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  and \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , the nation's history is being written not just in the capital and grand cities but also in small towns and etched in the lives of ordinary people.\par \par \uc2 I wrote a column recently exploring whether \uc2 Trump\uc2  is a racist, and a result was anti-Semitic vitriol from \uc2 Trump\uc2  followers, one of whom suggested I should be sent to the ovens for writing ''a typical Jewish hit piece.'' In fact, I'm Armenian and Christian, not Jewish, but the responses underscored that the \uc2 Trump\uc2  campaign is enveloped by a cloud of racial, ethnic and religious animosity -- much of it poorly informed.\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 Trump\uc2 -inspired malice seems ubiquitous. A \uc2 Georgetown University\uc2  study found a surge of anti-Muslim violence, from murders to attacks on mosques, coinciding with \uc2 Trump\uc2 's hostility toward Muslims. In March, a man attacked Muslim and Latino students in Kansas, shouting ''brown trash'' and ''\uc2 Trump\uc2  will take our country from you guys.''\par \par \uc2 I hope \uc2 Trump\uc2  and his aides will soon come to recognize that words have consequences that go far beyond politics, consequences that cannot be undone. It's perhaps inevitable that some overzealous supporters will periodically go too far, but \uc2 Trump\uc2  need not incite them, and he certainly shouldn't joke about harming protesters or tolerate advisers who propose a firing squad for his rival.\par \par \uc2 So far, \uc2 Trump\uc2  has arguably benefited from his fondness for over-the-top rhetoric. He gets attention and television time and is always at the center of his own hurricane. But in November, after the ballots have been counted and the crowds have gone home, we will still have a country to share, and I fear it may be a harsher and more fragile society because of \uc2 Trump\uc2 's campaigning today.\par \par \uc2 Inflammatory talk isn't entertaining, but dangerous. It's past time for \uc2 Trump\uc2  to grow up.\par \par \uc2 Yet if bigotry has been amplified by his candidacy, let's remember that there are still deep reservoirs of social capital -- including in conservative neighborhoods -- that have proved impervious to \uc2 Trump\uc2 's insinuations.\par \par \uc2 In Georgia, an India-born Muslim named Malik Waliyani bought a gas station and convenience store a few months ago and was horrified when it was recently burglarized and damaged. He struggled to keep it going. But then the nearby \uc2 Smoke Rise Baptist Church\uc2  heard what had happened.\par \par \uc2 ''Let's shower our neighbor with love,'' \uc2 Chris George\uc2 , the pastor, told his congregation at the end of his sermon, and more than 200 members drove over to assist, mostly by making purchases. One man drove his car around until the gas tank was empty, so he could buy more gas.\par \par \uc2 ''Our faith inspires us to build bridges, not to label people as us and them, but to recognize that we're all part of the same family,'' the pastor told me. ''Our world is a stronger place when we choose to look past labels and embrace others with love.''\par \par \uc2 This is a wrenching, divisive, polarizing time in America, and we have a major party nominee who is sowing hatred and perhaps violence. Let's not succumb. Good people, like the members of Smoke Rise Baptist, are reweaving our nation's social fabric even as it is being torn.\par \par \uc2 I invite you to sign up for my free, twice-weekly email newsletter.

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Washington -- As a college student in Virginia, Corey Jacobs started selling drugs with the help of a group of friends to make some extra money. A Bronx native, Mr. Jacobs was no kingpin, and no aspect of their drug conspiracy involved violence. Now age 46, Mr. Jacobs has served 16 years of a sentence of life without parole in the federal system.\par \par \uc2 No question, Corey Jacobs should have gone to prison for his felony. But does he deserve to die there?\par \par \uc2 His sentencing judge does not think so. Judge Henry Coke Morgan Jr. wrote in a letter supporting clemency for Mr. Jacobs that had the law not mandated a life sentence, he would not have imposed one for a first felony conviction.\par \par \uc2 Sadly, Mr. Jacobs is no anomaly. There are thousands like him serving sentences in our federal and state systems that are disproportionate to their crimes. The financial cost of our current incarceration policy is straining government budgets; the human and community costs are incalculable.\par \par \uc2 Today, a rare bipartisan consensus in favor of changing drug-sentencing laws presents an opportunity to improve the fairness and efficiency of America's criminal justice system. But to build on this coalition for reform, which includes senior law enforcement officials, we need action in Congress.\par \par \uc2 In February 2015, President Obama convened a group of lawmakers -- including the Republican senators Chuck Grassley of Iowa and \uc2 Rand Paul\uc2  of Kentucky and the Democratic senators Dick Durbin of Illinois and \uc2 Cory Booker\uc2  of New Jersey -- to build support for sweeping reforms. But the momentum has slowed thanks to opposition from a small group of Republican congressmen using language dredged from the past. One, Senator Tom Cotton of Arkansas, even claimed recently that ''we have an under-incarceration problem.''\par \par \uc2 The Republican presidential nominee, \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , is now fanning fears about the level of crime in America, which is actually at historic lows. Such pandering is a reminder of how we got here in the first place.\par \par \uc2 A few numbers help to illustrate the scale of the problem. From the late 1970s, America's incarceration rate more than quadrupled, to over 700 per 100,000 people from about 130; compare that with Russia, for example, which imprisons about 450 people per 100,000. Between 1970 and 2005, America's prison and jail population increased sevenfold, to approximately 2.2 million from about 300,000.\par \par \uc2 The United States has about 5 percent of the world's population, yet about 22 percent of its known prisoner population. In 2010, it cost about $80 billion per year to house these people in our prisons and jails.\par \par \uc2 Some more numbers: Controlling for other factors, the \uc2 United States Sentencing Commission\uc2  found that between December 2007 and September 2011, black male defendants received sentences 20 percent longer than their white counterparts. From 1983 to 1997, the number of African-Americans sent to prison for drug offenses went up more than 26-fold, compared with a sevenfold increase for whites. By the early 2000s, more than twice as many African-Americans as whites were in state prisons for drug offenses.\par \par \uc2 Individual responsibility must always be a primary consideration in deciding sentences, but we must also acknowledge that there is racial bias in the criminal justice system. The disparity in incarceration rates has bred distrust, alienating communities of color from those who serve valiantly in law enforcement.\par \par \uc2 The Justice Department has pioneered reform. Three years ago, as attorney general, I established the Smart on Crime initiative to reduce draconian mandatory minimum sentencing for low-level drug offenses and encourage more investment in rehabilitation programs to tackle recidivism.\par \par \uc2 The preliminary results are very encouraging. Over the last two years, federal prosecutors went from seeking a mandatory minimum penalty for drug trafficking in two-thirds of cases to doing so in less than half of them -- the lowest rate on record. The initiative may not be solely responsible, but 2014 saw the first consecutive drop in the federal prison population in more than three decades, coinciding with a falling crime rate.\par \par \uc2 Those who argue that without the hammer of a mandatory minimum sentence defendants won't cooperate are wrong -- in fact, the rate of cooperation held steady under the initiative, and the rate of guilty pleas remained constant. The system remained effective and became fairer. Reform has not made us less safe.\par \par \uc2 But there's a limit to what the Justice Department can accomplish on its own. Both the Senate and House are now considering comprehensive criminal justice reform bills that could limit the use of mandatory minimum sentences and give judges more power to not impose them. This would be a promising start, but reform must go much further.\par \par \uc2 Mandatory minimum sentences should be eliminated for many offenses, and where they are still applied, their length should be reduced. The legislative proposals necessarily reflect a compromise, but we must ensure that they go far enough: The judiciary needs greater discretion in imposing mandatory minimums, as do our prosecutors in seeking them.\par \par \uc2 Given the absence of parole in the federal system, we should increase the amount of sentence-reduction credit available to inmates with records of good conduct. And all offenders, regardless of their designated risk level, should get credit for participating in rehabilitation programs.\par \par \uc2 Federal drug courts provide proven alternatives to incarceration for men and women willing to do the hard work of recovery. We should increase investment in these programs, with a target of a court in every federal district within five years.\par \par \uc2 There is still a disparity in sentencing for offenses relating to crack and powder cocaine, chemically identical substances. Given the policy's differential racial impact, which erodes confidence in the justice system, this disparity must go. In the light of recent events, we can't afford criminal justice policies that reduce the already fragile trust between minority communities and law enforcement agencies.\par \par \uc2 The recidivism rate remains too high. We must remember that at least 95 percent of prisoners in state jails will eventually be released. They should have more support for their return to society, and we can increase their chances of making a successful transition by offering them the tools they need.\par \par \uc2 Mere familiarity is not a good reason to prolong a policy that's not working. There can be no compromise on public safety, but we need a new approach: About a third of the Justice Department's budget now goes to the Bureau of Prisons -- and in the absence of change, that proportion will grow. Reform would bring not only more fairness, but also fiscal benefits. Today, the rate and length of incarceration in this country is unprecedented and unsustainable. The success of the Smart on Crime initiative proves we can be safely bold about reform.\par \par \uc2 Whatever the outcomes of the bills before Congress and the presidential \uc2 election\uc2 , the Justice Department existing reforms must be preserved. Important as they are, all these initiatives have a bearing only on the federal justice system, which houses about 10 percent of the prison population. For the federal effort to be a template for reform in the states, where most prisoners are detained, Congress must lead.\par \par \uc2 The nation's lawmakers must stiffen their spines, ignore divisive language and schedule votes in this congressional session on reform legislation. An opportunity like this comes once in a generation. We must not miss it.\par \par \uc2 The over-reliance on mandatory minimum sentences must come to an end. Corey Jacobs -- and others like him -- have paid their debt to society.\par \par \uc2 Eric H. Holder Jr. was the attorney general of the United States from 2009 to 2015.\par \par \uc2 (PHOTOGRAPH BY CHARLES OMMANNEY/CONTACT PRESS IMAGES) \par \par \uc2 Document NYTF000020160814ec8e0006n\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 National Desk; SECTA\par \b \uc2 Seen as Vulnerable, a Transformed G.O.P. Incumbent Runs From \uc2 Trump\b0\par\par\uc2 By EMMARIE HUETTEMAN \par \uc2 1,434 \uc2 words\par \uc2 14 August 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 17\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 DENVER -- Representative Mike Coffman watches telenovelas. He admits this with a laugh that doubles him over, his hand clamping on a nearby shoulder for support, but the Colorado Republican has serious reasons for his immersion in Spanish-language soap operas.\par \par \uc2 He started learning Spanish in 2013, he said, shortly after being re-elected to a redistricted House seat whose constituents bore little resemblance to the far more conservative ones who sent him to Congress in 2008. Mr. Coffman, a retired Marine who co-sponsored a bill to make English the nation's official language and suggested that Hispanic voters who could not understand their ballots should ''pull out a dictionary,'' suddenly represented the most diverse district in Colorado.\par \par \uc2 And now he has to contend with \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , the Republican presidential nominee who kicked off his campaign by suggesting that many Mexican immigrants were drug dealers and rapists.\par \par \uc2 ''This is a unique case where a Republican is really going full-force to change with the times,'' said \uc2 David Wasserman\uc2 , an editor for the nonpartisan Cook Political Report who focuses on House races.\par \par \uc2 In an especially troublesome year to run as a Republican in a district where one in five residents is Latino, the race for Mr. Coffman's seat has become one of the most competitive, with Democrats hungrily eyeing it in their Quixotic quest to recapture the House. The fight for Colorado's Sixth District is one of 16 House races currently up for grabs, according to Larry J. Sabato's Crystal Ball political newsletter.\par \par \uc2 The House -- a m\u233\'00\'E9lange of gerrymandered districts that largely insulate members from political forces like a controversial presidential nominee-- is unlikely to turn blue this year. The Democrats would have to pick up at least 30 seats, a long-shot for a party whose leaders did not anticipate Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's rise early enough to recruit stronger candidates, Mr. Wasserman said. Republicans are more likely to see their 247-to-188 majority reduced by about 10 to 15 seats, political forecasters like Mr. Wasserman said.\par \par \uc2 But Republicans in the hot seats are fleeing Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's undertow. Early this month, Mr. Coffman became the first House Republican to air an ad explicitly distancing himself from his party's presidential candidate.\par \par \uc2 ''Honestly, I don't care for him much,'' Mr. Coffman said in the spot, which is running in English and Spanish.\par \par \uc2 In Colorado, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  is 14 percentage points behind \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , according to an NBC News/Wall Street Journal/Marist poll released Friday.\par \par \uc2 In keeping with Colorado's independent streak, about 21 percent said they were not planning to vote for either candidate or were undecided -- a group to which Mr. Coffman appealed when he also refused to support Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Mr. Coffman will have to do more than just retain the favor he has gained in his increasingly Democratic district, Mr. Wasserman said, because more Democrats turn out to vote in presidential \uc2 election\uc2  years.\par \par \uc2 And this year he is grappling with another factor: ''a very credible and talented opponent,'' Mr. Wasserman said.\par \par \uc2 That opponent, Morgan Carroll, a Democrat who served as president of the State Senate, listened intently on Aug. 6 as a couple of dozen Latino activists and voters enumerated their concerns at her campaign office as they munched on pan dulce, a Latin American pastry, and doughnuts. Grievances included a fractured education system, a flawed criminal justice system and a broken immigration system. She jotted down notes with a purple gel pen, letting her guests steer the conversation but slipping in to offer her position or a brief interpretation of the congressional landscape.\par \par \uc2 Ms. Carroll, who grew up in Colorado and has represented parts of the district in the state legislature since 2005, is a self-described policy nerd, dropping to a whisper as she confesses that. Ms. Carroll has read every bill she has ever voted on, she said, and a few she has not, such as the entire Affordable Care Act, she said -- twice.\par \par \uc2 In the legislature, Ms. Carroll sponsored legislation requiring universal background checks for firearms sales after the 2012 movie theater shooting in Aurora that left 12 dead and scores injured. Her bill became law in 2013.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Coffman, she said, helped foster the environment that led to Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's nomination.\par \par \uc2 ''He may realize that \uc2 Trump\uc2  is politically unpopular,'' Ms. Carroll said, ''and he may see that he not only needs to distance himself from \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2 , but, here's the kicker: Mike Coffman has to distance himself from Mike Coffman.''\par \par \uc2 Mr. Coffman's detractors see him as another pandering politician, willing to do anything to get re-elected. Another of Mr. Coffman's ads -- in which a handful of people of different ages and ethnicities say he is ''not like other Republicans'' but ''one of us'' -- draws bitter laughter at Ms. Carroll's campaign office.\par \par \uc2 ''He didn't find religion until he got redistricted,'' said Tim Sandos, a former Denver city councilman who is now the chief executive of the National Hispanic Voter Educational Foundation. ''And now all of a sudden he's 'one of us.'''\par \par \uc2 Democrats have tried to tie Mr. Coffman to his party's often bombastic standard-bearer, with the national campaign committee sinking $10,000 into television ads that ran last week and the progressive advocacy group Americans United for Change targeting Mr. Coffman among other vulnerable Republicans.\par \par \uc2 But Mr. Coffman is striving to rise above the national political environment. At Denver's annual Taste of Ethiopia festival this month, he dug into a spread of injera and beef tibs, eating the traditional way -- with his hands -- while squeezed between Nick Metz, the Aurora police chief, and Geta Asfaw, a prominent Ethiopian immigrant and a businessman who owns a number of \uc2 McDonald's\uc2  franchises.\par \par \uc2 After making his way through the platter and the crowd, Mr. Coffman accepted flowers and a traditional Ethiopian shirt from the festival's organizer before an appreciative audience. Mr. Coffman had warmed up the crowd with a few halting words in Amharic and remarks about the importance of one of the largest immigrant communities in the state.\par \par \uc2 Immediately after the appreciation ceremony for Mr. Coffman, the organizer introduced Ms. Carroll for her own brief remarks -- making no mention of the fact that she was running to unseat the apparent guest of honor.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's anti-immigrant rhetoric has troubled Ethiopians, Mr. Asfaw said. (''When you're negative about one immigrant, you affect the whole immigrant community,'' he said.) But many Ethiopian immigrants remember that Mr. Coffman went to their churches to grieve with them when the Islamic State beheaded a number of Ethiopians in Libya last year.\par \par \uc2 ''If more and more Republicans were like him, it would be a better world,'' Mr. Asfaw said.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Coffman rejects the characterization of himself as an opportunist. He did not have these immigrant communities among his constituents before, he said; now that he has learned about their struggles -- like the plight of a young, undocumented immigrant who wants to go to a military academy and is held back only by her immigration status -- he has changed his mind about some issues. He was one of a handful of Republicans to vote against a House bill that would have blocked President \uc2 Obama\uc2 's executive order to shield as many as five million illegal immigrants from deportation.\par \par \uc2 ''When you're with people and you hear stories like that, it changes your view,'' Mr. Coffman said.\par \par \uc2 But Mr. Coffman has not reached Maria Gonzalez. After she listened to the conversation in Ms. Carroll's campaign office for more than an hour, her story came spilling out: how her parents brought her into the country illegally; how immigration complications tore her family apart; how she became a citizen and successful businesswoman.\par \par \uc2 ''The doors have been closed on me. You have no idea,'' Ms. Gonzalez said, her voice raising and breaking as she began to cry. ''And so when I hear people like \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  and Mike Coffman -- are you serious? You don't know that I represent so many immigrants of this country.''\par \par \uc2 Find out what you need to know about the 2016 presidential race today, and get politics news updates via \uc2 Facebook\uc2 , \uc2 Twitter\uc2  and the First Draft newsletter.\par \par \uc2 Representative Mike Coffman of Colorado, top center, at an Ethiopian festival this month.

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 THE white working-class men who are planning to vote for \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2  this November have been called many things: xenophobic, racist, misogynist, dangerously na\u239\'00\'EFve. But even if those descriptions are true, it doesn't mean these men were fated to be \uc2 Trump\uc2  supporters. Recent research in social science and history suggests that they might have been out front in the fight against Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  -- if only the American labor movement weren't a shell of its former self.\par \par \uc2 When we think about unions, what typically come to mind are interest groups concerned with wages, benefits and working conditions. Scholars, however, have shown what everyone in politics knows instinctively: Unions are also political organizations that, under the right circumstances, can powerfully channel the working-class vote.\par \par \uc2 A classic study on this subject was done by the sociologist Seymour Martin Lipset. In a 1959 paper, he demonstrated that while the working class in most countries favors economic liberalism, it also displays an authoritarian streak. Using evidence from surveys, Mr. Lipset found blue-collar workers to be less committed to democratic norms like tolerance for political opponents, preference for rational argumentation over charismatic appeals and support for the rights of ethnic and racial minorities.\par \par \uc2 These tendencies, he claimed, were a function of lower levels of education and the isolation of many workers (for example, coal miners) from people who were different from them. Authoritarian attitudes also owed something to the work itself. Controversially, he suggested that manual work was at odds with the abstract thinking required to appreciate complex, pluralistic solutions to political problems.\par \par \uc2 Yet in Mr. Lipset's view unions had the potential to counter such tendencies. If infused with a democratic spirit -- organized and run in a non-autocratic fashion with an eye to the greater good -- a labor union might inculcate civic virtues in its members, pushing them to think and vote in a more enlightened way.\par \par \uc2 Though contemporary research has called aspects of Mr. Lipset's thesis into question (it turns out that position in the class structure per se does less to account for tolerance than does education), his broader insight -- that how the working class throws its political weight around depends on what's happening in the labor movement -- finds strong support.\par \par \uc2 For instance, the sociologist Jake Rosenfeld, analyzing data from the Current Population Survey, reports in a recent book that unions are remarkably effective at getting people to the polls. The effects of union membership on voter turnout are especially large, he finds, for workers with only a high school education, who might otherwise feel marginalized politically.\par \par \uc2 Unions can also push their members to overcome prejudices bearing on politics. In a paper published this year the historian Timothy Minchin argues that backing from the A.F.L.-C.I.O. was vital to the \uc2 election\uc2  of \uc2 Barack Obama\uc2  in 2008. According to Mr. Minchin, Mr. Obama was a tough sell to white union members with less progressive racial attitudes. But seeing the potential in Mr. Obama, who was a former community organizer, \uc2 Richard Trumka\uc2 , then the secretary-treasurer of the A.F.L.-C.I.O., turned on the charm -- and opened his organization's wallet. Through speeches, meetings and mass mailings he pressed Mr. Obama's case.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Trumka's efforts were successful. Exit polls showed that white men who didn't belong to unions voted overwhelmingly for \uc2 John McCain\uc2 , but unionized white men ended up supporting Mr. Obama, giving him a needed edge.\par \par \uc2 In Europe, as in the United States, working-class men are a key constituency for the far-right political parties that are now ascendant. Yet in a study published last month of 16 European nations, the political scientists Christoph Arndt and Line Rennwald found that union membership helps inoculate workers against the far right's message. While the far right has been able to gain ground even in countries like Sweden where unionization rates are high, in general employees covered by collective bargaining agreements feel less threatened by the social changes that agitate far-right ideologues. (It is not an accident of history that Hitler abolished German trade unions as part of his consolidation of power, or that farmers and small business owners were more sympathetic to the Nazi cause than were industrial workers reared on unionism.)\par \par \uc2 IF unions can steer workers in democratic directions, why haven't they been able to tamp down the appeal of Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 ? Unions have in fact been heavily involved in the anti-\uc2 Trump\uc2  campaign. But there are limits to what they can do. After all, the A.F.L.-C.I.O.'s successes on behalf of Mr. Obama were limited primarily to unionized voters. And unions have been profoundly weakened by changes in the American economic structure, and by decades of assaults against them by the Republican Party.\par \par \uc2 In the post-World War II era, one in three American workers belonged to a union; now it's down to one in 10. In terms of representing the traditional working class, the number is even smaller, since a large and growing share of union members consists of public sector employees with college degrees (like teachers).\par \par \uc2 Union decline has left the working class politically and economically vulnerable, and it's this vulnerability Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  has been able to exploit. (For obvious reasons, working-class African-Americans and Latinos are antipathetic.) If unions had anything like their former influence, how many workers would buy the empty economic promises Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  is making -- a man whose recently announced economic advisory team is made up largely of fellow billionaires, and who has said that hourly wages are too high?\par \par \uc2 There's a lesson here for the future. American unions have a checkered history and are far from perfect. But as an institution, unions are an essential bulwark for democracy. We've allowed them to wither at our peril.\par \par \uc2 Neil Gross, a professor of sociology at Colby College, is the author of ''Why Are Professors Liberal and Why Do Conservatives Care?''\par \par \uc2 DRAWING (DRAWING BY YANN KEBBI) \par \par \uc2 Document NYTF000020160814ec8e0006f\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 National Desk; SECTA\par \b \uc2 Pence Hints He May Release Tax Returns\b0\par\par\uc2 By YAMICHE ALCINDOR; Thomas Kaplan contributed reporting from Fairfield, Conn. \par \uc2 642 \uc2 words\par \uc2 14 August 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 17\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 COLUMBUS, Ind. -- \uc2 Gov. Mike Pence\uc2  of Indiana, the Republican vice-presidential nominee, suggested Saturday that he might release his tax returns before \uc2 Election\uc2  Day, even as his running mate has shown no inclination of doing the same.\par \par \uc2 Breaking with campaign custom, the Republican presidential nominee, \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , has refused to release his returns. On Friday, the Democratic presidential nominee, \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , and her running mate, Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia, made public their own 2015 returns, while pointedly noting that Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  had not.\par \par \uc2 On Saturday morning, at a campaign stop in his hometown, Columbus, Ind., Mr. Pence ignored questions from reporters about whether he would release his returns. But in an interview with Rita Cosby of \uc2 WABC Radio\uc2  that aired on Saturday, he hinted, though he did not promise, that his returns could become public.\par \par \uc2 ''When my forms are filed and when my tax returns are released it's going to be a quick read, Rita,'' Mr. Pence said.\par \par \uc2 His answer suggested he had not yet filed his 2015 return; the \uc2 Internal Revenue Service\uc2  allows taxpayers to apply for a six-month extension from the April filing deadline. His campaign did not respond Saturday evening to requests for more details.\par \par \uc2 If he were to release his returns before Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  did, it would not be the first time he broke with the top of the ticket. The governor is a markedly different candidate from Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , maintaining his balanced demeanor and even disagreeing with the volatile Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  at times, creating an unusual pairing that both men seem comfortable with for now.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  has said he would not release his tax returns because they are being audited. Democrats have suggested he does not want to show them because they might reveal he is not as wealthy as he claims to be, or perhaps that he pays little in federal taxes because of breaks for real estate developers.\par \par \uc2 When Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  released her returns on Friday -- showing that she and her husband had earned an adjusted gross income of $10.6 million last year, mostly from books and speeches -- Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  made a point to note that she had paid a third of her income in federal taxes.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Kaine and his wife, Anne Holton, who was Virginia's secretary of education until she stepped down last month, reported income of $313,441 for 2015.\par \par \uc2 At a rally in New Hampshire on Saturday, Mr. Kaine assailed Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  for keeping his tax returns under wraps. ''Even Richard Nixon released his tax returns to the public when he was running for president,'' Mr. Kaine said.\par \par \uc2 (In fact, President Nixon did not release his taxes until 1973, a year after his last campaign. Other than \uc2 Gerald Ford\uc2 , who released a summary of his return, every presidential candidate since then has made their recent returns public.)\par \par \uc2 ''He says the rules that apply to everybody else do not apply to \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2 ,'' Mr. Kaine said.\par \par \uc2 In his radio interview, Mr. Pence noted that he had not become wealthy over his past 16 years as a congressman and governor, and took a shot of his own at Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 ''All of this class warfare talk that we heard coming out of her speech yesterday rings a little bit hollow,'' he said. ''What you have, you know, what you have in the Clintons is an extremely prosperous family that's made tens of millions of dollars related to and derivative of their time in and around public service, and the American people now know that clearly from that release.''\par \par \uc2 Find out what you need to know about the 2016 presidential race today, and get politics news updates via \uc2 Facebook\uc2 , \uc2 Twitter\uc2  and the First Draft newsletter.\par \par \uc2 Document NYTF000020160814ec8e00064\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

Nominee\b0\par\par\uc2 By MAUREEN DOWD \par \uc2 982 \uc2 words\par \uc2 14 August 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 9\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 WASHINGTON -- SPEAKING of crazy ...\par \par \uc2 All these woebegone Republicans whining that they can't rally behind their flawed candidate is crazy. The G.O.P. angst, the gnashing and wailing and searching for last-minute substitutes and exit strategies, is getting old.\par \par \uc2 They already have a 1-percenter who will be totally fine in the Oval Office, someone they can trust to help Wall Street, boost the \uc2 U.S. Chamber of Commerce\uc2 , cuddle with hedge funds, secure the trade deals beloved by corporate America, seek guidance from Henry Kissinger and hawk it up -- unleashing hell on Syria and heaven knows where else.\par \par \uc2 The Republicans have their candidate: It's Hillary.\par \par \uc2 They can't go with \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2 . He's too volatile and unhinged.\par \par \uc2 The erstwhile Goldwater Girl and Goldman Sachs busker can be counted on to do the normal political things, not the abnormal haywire things. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's propounding could drag us into war, plunge us into a recession and shatter Washington into a thousand tiny bits.\par \par \uc2 Hillary will keep the establishment safe. Who is more of an establishment figure, after all? Her husband was president, and he repealed Glass-Steagall, signed the Defense of Marriage Act and got rid of those pesky welfare queens.\par \par \uc2 Pushing her Midwestern Methodist roots, taking advantage of primogeniture, Hillary often seems more Republican than the Gotham bling king, who used to be a Democrat and donor to Democratic candidates before he jumped the turnstile.\par \par \uc2 Hillary is a reliable creature of Wall Street. Her tax return showed the Clintons made $10.6 million last year, and like other superrich families, they incorporated with the \uc2 Clinton\uc2  Executive Services Corporation (which was billed for the infamous server). \uc2 Trump\uc2  has started holding up goofy charts at rallies showing Hillary has gotten $48,500,000 in contributions from hedge funders, compared to his $19,000.\par \par \uc2 Unlike \uc2 Trump\uc2 , she hasn't been trashing leading Republicans. You know that her pals \uc2 John McCain\uc2  and \uc2 Lindsey Graham\uc2  are secretly rooting for her. There is a cascade of prominent Republicans endorsing Hillary, donating to Hillary, appearing in Hillary ads, talking up Hillary's charms.\par \par \uc2 Robert Kagan, a former Reagan State Department aide, adviser to the McCain and \uc2 Mitt Romney\uc2  campaigns and Iraq war booster, headlined a Hillary fund-raiser this summer. Another neocon, James Kirchick, keened in The Daily Beast, ''\uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  is the one person standing between America and the abyss.''\par \par \uc2 She has finally stirred up some emotion in women, even if it is just moderate suburban Republican women palpitating to leave their own nominee, who has the retro air of a guy who just left the dim recesses of a Playboy bunny club.\par \par \uc2 The Democratic nominee put out an ad featuring \uc2 Trump\uc2 -bashing Michael Hayden, an N.S.A. and C.I.A. chief under W. who was deemed ''incongruent'' by the Senate when he testified about torture methods. And she earned an endorsement from John Negroponte, a Reagan hand linked to American-trained death squads in Latin America.\par \par \uc2 Politico\uc2  reports that the \uc2 Clinton\uc2  team sent out feelers to see if Kissinger, the Voldemort of Vietnam, and Condi Rice, the conjurer of Saddam's apocalyptic mushroom cloud, would back Hillary.\par \par \uc2 Hillary has written that Kissinger is an ''idealistic'' friend whose counsel she valued as secretary of state, drawing a rebuke from Bernie Sanders during the primaries: ''I'm proud to say Henry Kissinger is not my friend.''\par \par \uc2 The Hillary team seems giddy over its windfall of Republicans and neocons running from the \uc2 Trump\uc2  sharknado. But as David Weigel wrote in The \uc2 Washington Post\uc2 , the specter of Kissinger, the man who advised Nixon to prolong the Vietnam War to help with his re-\uc2 election\uc2 , fed a perception that ''the Democratic nominee has returned to her old, hawkish ways and is again taking progressives for granted.''\par \par \uc2 And Isaac Chotiner wrote in Slate, ''The prospect of Kissinger having influence in a \uc2 Clinton\uc2  White House is downright scary.''\par \par \uc2 Hillary is a safer bet in many ways for conservatives. \uc2 Trump\uc2  likes to say he is flexible. What if he returns to his liberal New York positions on gun control and abortion rights?\par \par \uc2 Trump\uc2  is far too incendiary in his manner of speaking, throwing around dangerous and self-destructive taunts about ''Second Amendment people'' taking out Hillary, or President Obama and Hillary being the founders of ISIS. And he still blindly follows his ego, failing to understand the fundamentals of a campaign. ''I don't know that we need to get out the vote,'' he told Fox News Thursday. ''I think people that really wanna vote are gonna get out and they're gonna vote for \uc2 Trump\uc2 .''\par \par \uc2 Hillary, on the other hand, understands her way around political language and Washington rituals. Of course you do favors for wealthy donors. And if you want to do something incredibly damaging to the country, like enabling George W. Bush to make the worst foreign policy blunder in U.S. history, don't shout inflammatory and fabricated taunts from a microphone.\par \par \uc2 You must walk up to the microphone calmly, as Hillary did on the Senate floor the day of the Iraq war vote, and accuse Saddam of giving ''aid, comfort and sanctuary to terrorists, including Al Qaeda,'' repeating the Bush administration's phony case for war.\par \par \uc2 If you want to carry the G.O.P. banner, your fabrications have to be more sneaky.\par \par \uc2 As Republican strategist \uc2 Steve Schmidt\uc2  noted on MSNBC, ''the candidate in the race most like George W. Bush and Dick Cheney from a foreign policy perspective is in fact \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , not the Republican nominee.''\par \par \uc2 And that's how Republicans prefer their crazy -- not like \uc2 Trump\uc2 , but like Cheney.\par \par \uc2 I invite you to follow me on Twitter (@NYTimesDowd).\par \par \uc2 Follow The \uc2 New York Times\uc2  Opinion section on \uc2 Facebook\uc2  and Twitter (@NYTopinion), and sign up for the Opinion Today newsletter.\par \par \uc2 Document NYTF000020160814ec8e0005v\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 OP-ED COLUMNIST\par \uc2 Sunday Review Desk; SECTSR\par \b \uc2 A Playboy for President\b0\par\par\uc2 By ROSS DOUTHAT \par \uc2 899 \uc2 words\par \uc2 14 August 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 9\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 IN a different campaign or era, it would have been a race-altering moment; in this one, it was barely a scandal. There was Melania \uc2 Trump\uc2 , the potential first lady of the United States, posing stark naked in '90s-era photos published by the New York Post -- and then in the next day's edition, canoodling lipstick-lesbian style in bed. Yet the press yawned, her husband's latest outrage overshadowed it, and it only stayed a story because the date of the photos raised questions about the future Mrs. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's immigration status.\par \par \uc2 This \uc2 election\uc2  was supposed to be a referendum on \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , long a polarizing figure because she seemed to embody the cultural transformations of the 1960s -- the liberal, feminist, working-mother spouse of the first boomer president.\par \par \uc2 But in the year of \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2 , the religious conservatives who fought many of those transformations find themselves reduced to a hapless rump. The best have retreated to rebuild; the worst have abased themselves before a sybaritic, irreligious presidential nominee.\par \par \uc2 So in word, deed and his wife's ''artistic'' shots, it's \uc2 Trump\uc2  rather than \uc2 Clinton\uc2  who has confirmed the full triumph of the sexual revolutions.\par \par \uc2 I say revolutions, plural, because \uc2 Trump\uc2  is a reminder that the 1960s happened in stages, with different figures and worldviews shaping its social shifts. As John Podhoretz wrote in a shrewd column, \uc2 Trump\uc2  and Hillary are both children of the '60s -- but of its opposite ends, the Brat Pack era in \uc2 Trump\uc2 's case and the flowering of boomer liberalism in Hillary's.\par \par \uc2 Much of what seems strange and reactionary about \uc2 Trump\uc2  is tied to what was normal to a certain kind of Sinatra and Mad Men-era man -- the casual sexism, the odd mix of sleaziness and formality, even the insult-comic style.\par \par \uc2 But while that male culture was ''conservative'' in its exploitative attitudes toward women, it was itself in rebellion against bourgeois norms and Middle-American Christianity. And if Hillary is a (partial, given her complicated marriage) avatar of Gloria Steinem-era feminism, her opponent is an heir of the male revolutionary in whose club Steinem once went undercover: Hugh Hefner.\par \par \uc2 It was Hefner who fully embodied the male sexual revolt. Today he's just a sleazy oldster, but in the beginning he was a faux philosopher, preaching a gospel cribbed from bohemia and various Freudian enemies of repression, in which the blessed pursuit of promiscuity was the human birthright. But really a male birthright, for a certain kind of man: The sort of hep cat who loved inviting the ladies back to his pad ''for a quiet discussion on Picasso, Nietzsche, jazz, sex.''\par \par \uc2 That was the ideal, at least. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , the thrice-married ubermensch who jokes about Megyn Kelly's period, is the more usual reality. (So, albeit with more surface class, was the ultimate early-'60s man, the sex-addicted J.F.K.)\par \par \uc2 That obvious gulf helps explain why Hefner passed from a phenomenon to a sideshow, while a more feminist vision of liberation became the official ideology of the liberal upper class.\par \par \uc2 But only gradually and partially. The men's sexual revolution, in which freedom meant freedom to take your pleasure while women took the pill, is still a potent force, and not only in the halls of Fox News. From Hollywood and college campuses to rock concert backstages and Bill \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's political operation, it has persisted as a pervasive but unspoken philosophy in precincts officially committed to cultural liberalism and sexual equality.\par \par \uc2 It has also endured by going downmarket in the culture. If you watched ''The Girls Next Door,'' the TV show about Hefner's m\u233\'00\'E9nage, you noticed that the Playboy mystique was emphatically not a joke in the lower middle class environs that produced his centerfolds and their most adoring fans. Like Trumpism, Hefnerian values have prospered in the blue-collar vacuum created by religion's retreat, community's unraveling.\par \par \uc2 Then finally, among men who were promised pliant centerfolds and ended up single with only high-speed internet to comfort them, the men's sexual revolution has curdled into a toxic subculture, resentful of female empowerment in all its forms.\par \par \uc2 This is where you find \uc2 Trump\uc2 's strongest (and, yes, strangest) fans. He's become the Daddy Alpha for every alpha-aspiring beta male, whose mix of moral liberation and misogyny keeps the Ring-a-Ding-Ding dream alive.\par \par \uc2 There aren't nearly enough of these fans to win him the \uc2 election\uc2 . Steinem's revolution (Clintonian complications and all) should easily beat Hef's at the ballot box this year.\par \par \uc2 But the cultural conflict between these two post-revolutionary styles -- between frat guys and feminist bluestockings, Gamergaters and the diversity police, alt-right provocateurs and ''woke'' dudebros, the mouthbreathers who poured hate on the all-female ''Ghostbusters'' and the tastemakers who pretended it was good -- is likely here to stay. With time and Christianity's further decline, it could eclipse older culture war battles; in the pop culture landscape, it already does.\par \par \uc2 Ten years ago, liberals pined for a post-religious right, a different culture war.\par \par \uc2 Be careful what you wish for.\par \par \uc2 I invite you to follow me on Twitter (@DouthatNYT).\par \par \uc2 Follow The \uc2 New York Times\uc2  Opinion section on \uc2 Facebook\uc2  and Twitter (@NYTopinion), and sign up for the Opinion Today newsletter.\par \par \uc2 Document NYTF000020160814ec8e0005u\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 BIG CITY\par \uc2 Metropolitan Desk; SECTMB\par \b \uc2 In the Rough With \uc2 Trump\b0\par\par\uc2 By GINIA BELLAFANTE \par \uc2 1,390 \uc2 words\par \uc2 14 August 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 1\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Last summer, when \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's presidential bid still seemed like a protracted April Fool's joke, a lavish municipal golf course bearing his name -- \uc2 Trump\uc2  Golf Links at Ferry Point -- had just opened in New York City. This was many unhinged remarks ago, back in the early-morning hours of all the rancor, when he was condemning Mexicans as rapists and drug dealers best kept out of the country he hoped to govern, or as others would come to view it, tyrannize. Do you remember when you thought it would all end there? Even then, before the \uc2 Trump\uc2  candidacy had attained the fervor it would eventually acquire, there was reason to speculate whether his political volatility would imperil his business interests, and what it would mean for the city's partnership with him if it did.\par \par \uc2 In May, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's campaign released financial disclosure forms through the \uc2 Federal \uc2 Election\uc2  Commission\uc2  that indicated his fortunes had, in fact, surged during the time he had been running. Though \uc2 Macy's\uc2 , for instance, had terminated an agreement to sell \uc2 Trump\uc2 -licensed shirts and ties, other domains in his empire, the paperwork implied, were flourishing.\par \par \uc2 On a recent weekday morning, hot and humid enough to make you wish you had woken up in an ice-speckled tub of Bud Light, the activity at Ferry Point did not suggest otherwise. All available tee times that day had been sold out. The parking lot was full. If a consumer rejection of \uc2 Trump\uc2  Inc. did not appear to be forthcoming in New York City, where precisely would it ever occur?\par \par \uc2 Contrary to statements made by the \uc2 Trump\uc2  campaign during the Republican convention, the city, not Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , built the golf course at Ferry Point, for $127 million. Four years ago, in a deal finalized under Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg's administration, the \uc2 Trump\uc2  Organization\uc2  came on board to operate the course, assume the expense of upkeep and build a $10 million clubhouse, yet to be erected. Nevertheless, the greenway, maintained to luxurious standard, has the effect of abrading principle away.\par \par \uc2 In the chipping area, a group of men who did not embrace Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's politics seemed perfectly content to play on the course. Thomas Nissen, who worked in the nonprofit world, was on his way to graduate school and said that he held political beliefs befitting that profile, explained that he had managed to separate Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's ''brash and radioactive personality from his pristine golf course.'' Mr. Nissen was, by his own account, skilled at compartmentalizing. ''If I were a Republican and Hillary were running a restaurant and the food was really great, I'd go,'' he offered. He was playing 18 holes at Ferry Point for the third time this season.\par \par \uc2 One year ago, when Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  initially suggested building a wall at the Mexican border, Mayor \uc2 Bill de Blasio\uc2  expressed outrage and disgust, declaring that the city would review all of its contracts with the \uc2 Trump\uc2  Organization\uc2 . But the mayor's legal team discovered that the city could not exit those arrangements without making itself vulnerable to expensive First Amendment suits it could not win. In December, Karen Hinton, who was then the mayor's chief spokeswoman, said of Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  in an email that the mayor ''has made it clear that he will do all he can to ensure the city no longer does any business, with him going forward.'' Those feelings, she said ''have only grown stronger since the summer.'' Six months later, some of that sentiment seemed to have faded. In June, the Mayor's Cup, a golf tournament involving students from city public, private and parochial schools, was held at Ferry Point, and although greens fees were waived, the Education Department gave the \uc2 Trump\uc2  Organization\uc2  $3,000 for postgame refreshments.\par \par \uc2 When I questioned the transaction, which however small in scale, left a sour symbolic residue, asking why the tournament was not held at one of the city's 12 other municipal courses, a press officer for the mayor said that it would have been wrong to deprive children of the chance to play on the nicest course, and that the mayor had nothing to do with the Mayor's Cup anyway.\par \par \uc2 The structure of the deal the city forged with the \uc2 Trump\uc2  Organization\uc2  at Ferry Point does not require it to remit licensing fees to the city until 2019, at which point the company will pay 7 percent of gross revenue (or $300,000, the cost of a well-appointed summer rental in Southampton, whichever is higher). In its first year of operation, according to the city, revenue totaled $8 million, meaning that if fees had been collected, the city would have received $560,000 -- $175,000 short of what, in its contract with the \uc2 Trump\uc2  Organization\uc2 , it projected it could make during the first year. Leaving that aside, even if the city were bringing in one million or even two million dollars annually from the partnership, we would still be looking well into the second term of a Barron \uc2 Trump\uc2  -- or Barron \uc2 Trump\uc2  Jr. -- presidency before the city would be getting back much of the $127 million of taxpayer money it spent to create the course in the first place.\par \par \uc2 If the entirety of Ferry Point Park, which serves a poor surrounding area, were well kept, then the presence of the golf course, meant for marketing executives in Westchester County and bond traders in TriBeCa, might be easier to tolerate. Sitting on the southeastern shore of the Bronx, Ferry Point is a vast park, bifurcated by the Whitestone Bridge. In addition to the golf course, it encompasses a nine-acre green space and playground bordering a public-housing project, just beyond a fence along the fairway, and a second area, west of the bridge. But despite all the money that went into building the course, the park, created in conjunction with it, still did not have bathrooms last year. This year, the bathrooms are in place, but the park is so poorly shaded that parents in the neighborhood said it continued to be rarely used.\par \par \uc2 On the day I visited, the water fountain closest to the playground was not working. Last summer when I went, none of the fountains were working at all, so this was ostensibly an improvement. In the part of the park known as Ferry Point West, where Latino immigrants congregate and cook out on the weekends, bathrooms that were supposed to be completed in 2012 and were delayed because of Hurricane Sandy were still not built. They were scheduled to be finished this year; the parks department now says they will not be completed until the winter. A row of trees that stood as a Sept. 11 memorial had been vandalized and desecrated but had yet to be replaced. In this part of the park, too, the first water fountain I landed at didn't work. The parking lot was filthy. None of the money earmarked by the mayor to make the city's parks system more equitable has ever been directed to Ferry Point.\par \par \uc2 Although blame for the arrangement with Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  must be laid at the feet of Mr. Bloomberg, whose speech at the Democratic National Convention made it clear what he thought of the candidate as a businessman, it is the current mayor whose vision for the city is least clear when you find yourself in a park where imbalances in the city's fortunes are among the most stark. A few days ago, two young fathers from the Throggs Neck Houses who had taken their children to the playground just over the fence from the golf course looked out at it. They didn't know that Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  was involved. They did know that no one had asked them if they would ever want to learn to play.\par \par \uc2 EMAIL: bigcity@nytimes.com\par \par \uc2 Clockwise from top: A view of the Manhattan skyline from \uc2 Trump\uc2  Golf Links at Ferry Point, a municipal course on the Bronx side of the Whitestone Bridge that cost the city $127 million; Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's name is prominently displayed at the course; and trying to reach the green from a sand trap.

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 In early May, when Dr. Thomas Stossel told his wife, Dr. Kerry Maguire, of his plan to vote for \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2  in the general \uc2 election\uc2 , she hit him with an ultimatum.\par \par \uc2 ''If you vote for \uc2 Trump\uc2 , I will divorce you and move to Canada,'' she recalled telling him. He tried to laugh it off.\par \par \uc2 ''I'm serious,'' Dr. Maguire told him.\par \par \uc2 Before this spat, through nearly 20 years of marriage, politics had never caused much friction between Dr. Maguire, a dentist who is the director of the children's outreach program at the Forsyth Institute in Cambridge, Mass., and Dr. Stossel, a hematologist and professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School.\par \par \uc2 Then came the 2016 presidential campaign. A political season that has made for hot debates in the public arena has also seeped into private lives, complicating friendships, marriages, romances and relationships among family members.\par \par \uc2 Dr. Maguire, 59, and her husband, 74, have disagreed over politics before, but never like this. During the 2012 presidential campaign, they had two signs planted side by side on their front lawn in Belmont, Mass.: one for her choice, \uc2 Barack Obama\uc2 , and the other for his, \uc2 Mitt Romney\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 ''Politics were very low on the list of priorities when we met,'' said Dr. Stossel, whose political ideology made a rightward turn in the 1980s, bringing him more in line with his brother, John Stossel, who hosts ''Stossel'' on the \uc2 Fox Business Network\uc2 . ''Therapists say you have the best relationships when you are clearly separate people. And I like to think that we are emotionally centered, so that we can have a major disagreement about something and it's not a big problem.''\par \par \uc2 The couple avoided discussing the campaign into the summer, and Dr. Maguire, who said she will vote for \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , fell under the impression that her husband would no longer be supporting Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 . But in an interview on July 28, Dr. Stossel restated his support for the Republican nominee.\par \par \uc2 ''I'm reasonably convinced that Hillary is handcuffed to the economic progressive populism that has totally taken over the Democratic Party, a.k.a., socialism,'' said Dr. Stossel, a visiting scholar at the conservative \uc2 American Enterprise Institute\uc2 . ''I think that if she gets power and the party gets power, there is a good likelihood that the agendas of that movement will be enacted. To me, that counters what I consider to be what brings us prosperity, which is entrepreneurship.''\par \par \uc2 When asked about Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's talk of building a wall along the United States-Mexico border and banning Muslim immigrants, Dr. Stossel said: ''I think it is very unlikely that he can pull any of that stuff off. It seems improbable to me, because he still has to work in the constraints of what I hope will be a checks and balances system. Frankly, I don't think he is going to have to make good on a lot of these crazy promises.''\par \par \uc2 In a separate interview later that afternoon, Dr. Maguire seemed unaware of her husband's stance. She sounded confident that Dr. Stossel had been dissuaded from his support by friends, as well as her quasi-threat to leave him. When told by this reporter of her husband's intent to go through with voting for Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , she seemed shocked, if not angry.\par \par \uc2 ''That is news to me,'' Dr. Maguire said. ''And I'll be calling my attorney.''\par \par \uc2 After a pause, she went on: ''I don't think he will vote for him. But if he does, I hope he never tells me about it. For someone who is so reasonable in every other part of his life, and who expects people to have expertise, it doesn't really link with the Tom Stossel that I know.\par \par \uc2 ''I would just be disgusted on every level,'' she continued. ''And also a little fearful. Disgusted on the marriage level, but fearful for our society.''\par \par \uc2 Anna Sproul-Latimer, an agent with the Ross Yoon Literary Agency in Washington, D.C., believed she knew the man she would marry. But that was before politics got in the way.\par \par \uc2 When she met Matt Latimer in 2008, he was a disaffected former speechwriter in the George W. Bush administration. Back then she considered herself something of a Libertarian, although she had supported Mr. Obama's first presidential run.\par \par \uc2 As the years went by and their relationship deepened, she found that she believed in things such as the Affordable Care Act and began to doubt the ideology of the Libertarian movement. With the Tea Party's insurgency in 2010, she learned that her husband held many Tea Party ideals in high esteem, especially when it came to limited government.\par \par \uc2 ''I loved him and still love him,'' said Ms. Sproul-Latimer, 31, ''but at the same time I had to resist my first instinct, which was to say, 'Gross.'''\par \par \uc2 Despite their growing political differences, they went through with the wedding in 2012. \uc2 Donald Rumsfeld\uc2 , the former secretary of defense for whom Mr. Latimer had worked, attended. Today the couple share views on many social issues, especially when it comes to school choice and rights for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people, but the \uc2 Clinton\uc2 -\uc2 Trump\uc2  contest has reopened old wounds.\par \par \uc2 They were especially at odds in the early part of the campaign, when Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  was a fresh character on the political scene.\par \par \uc2 ''I loved him when he first ran,'' said Mr. Latimer, 45, a founding partner of Javelin, a literary agency and communications firm. ''I thought he was hilarious. I loved the idea that he would drive everyone insane. I loved that he was pure chaos and total stream of consciousness.''\par \par \uc2 As Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's momentum grew, the household showed signs of strain. Mr. Latimer cheered the unraveling of the party's establishment. And while not ready to jump on the ''\uc2 Trump\uc2  Train,'' he said, he was willing to give Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  a chance.\par \par \uc2 ''One time he kept talking about how \uc2 Trump\uc2  was winning,'' Ms. Sproul-Latimer said, recalling a discussion they had one night just before bed. ''And I just flew off the handle, saying, 'You're just trying to provoke me.' And he said, 'It's just a discussion. It's reality.'''\par \par \uc2 These days, they try to stay away from discussing the campaign.\par \par \uc2 ''We are treading a lot more lightly on our politics at home,'' Ms. Sproul-Latimer said.\par \par \uc2 In her view, a \uc2 Trump\uc2  presidency would be an ''utter disaster for the country.'' In his view, Ms. Sproul-Latimer has become ''an unnofficial surrogate for Hillary.''\par \par \uc2 Last month, as they watched the broadcast of the Democratic National Convention, things got tense.\par \par \uc2 ''When \uc2 Bill \uc2 Clinton\uc2  spoke, I would make some jokes about it and she would laugh,'' Mr. Latimer said. ''She would make some jokes and I would laugh. And then it got to a point where maybe I was making too many jokes and suddenly she has to defend the Clintons. And then it's not funny anymore.''\par \par \uc2 Mr. Latimer's decision is still up in the air. But he knows one thing: He will not be voting for Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 In an Aug. 9 opinion column for The \uc2 New York Times\uc2 , Mr. Latimer identified himself as someone who ''respected the wishes of a clear plurality of Republican primary voters'' but called on \uc2 Mike Pence\uc2 , the Republican vice-presidential nominee, to persuade Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  to withdraw.\par \par \uc2 After its publication, Ms. Sproul-Latimer described herself as ''temporarily relieved.''\par \par \uc2 ''At several points in our marriage, I've wondered if our political views reveal fundamental differences in what we believe, what's right and what's wrong,'' she said. ''But that's swiftly been followed by moments of relief where I realize that we do have the same moral code. Knowing \uc2 Trump\uc2 's recent behavior has cast doubt in Matt's mind was that kind of moment.''\par \par \uc2 For his part, Mr. Latimer said, ''I never viewed my support or lack of support for Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  as something that would affect my marriage.\par \par \uc2 ''But if she thinks by not supporting \uc2 Trump\uc2  I'll be moving in her direction, she's incorrect. We've supported different candidates before and will continue to do so. That said, if for any reason I would join the '\uc2 Trump\uc2  Train,' it would disturb her. My joining it now is not impossible. But it is extremely unlikely.''\par \par \uc2 Married couples aren't the only ones who find themselves unable to discuss politics in this charged environment. The campaign has also had an effect on people looking for love, according to Maria Avgitidis, who runs the Manhattan matchmaking service Agape Match. She said that politics has never been a big issue in her line of work, until now.\par \par \uc2 When she asks her clients to give her a list of their ''deal-breakers,'' she said, the first is smoking. The second, for the moment, is supporting Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 ''He's creating obstacles that I haven't seen in the last 10 years,'' Ms. Avgitidis said. ''I'm having men saying, 'I'm having a really great time with her but she's a \uc2 Trump\uc2  supporter and I'm not interested.' Or, 'She's Republican and I feel like she's going to vote for \uc2 Trump\uc2  and I'm not interested in being with someone like that.'\par \par \uc2 ''I'm hoping this will all kind of dissolve after November, but what if it doesn't?''\par \par \uc2 Soon after learning that her husband was not backing away from his decision to support Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , Dr. Maguire picked him up at work. She was livid. In the car she asked him how he could actually vote for Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  after everything that has happened. And why did she have to hear about it from a reporter?\par \par \uc2 Dr. Stossel replied that checks and balances were in place that would keep a President \uc2 Trump\uc2  from putting the country in any real danger.\par \par \uc2 Following the talk in the car, they found themselves at an impasse. But the next few days saw Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  doubling down on his criticisms of Khizr and Ghazala Khan, who had appeared at the Democratic National Convention on behalf of their son, Capt. Humayun Khan, who died protecting his fellow soldiers in a 2004 car bombing in Iraq.\par \par \uc2 While that story dominated a news cycle, Dr. Stossel told his wife that, to salvage his intellectual reputation, he may have to change his mind. Soon after that, he told her he planned to vote for the Libertarian ticket -- a vote that, in his view, would not matter in left-leaning Massachusetts, but one that his conscience and marriage could withstand.\par \par \uc2 ''The good news is, we're not getting divorced,'' Dr. Stossel said.\par \par \uc2 ''As far as I'm concerned,'' Dr. Maguire said, ''we're in a better place both as a couple and as a country with one less vote for \uc2 Trump\uc2 .''\par \par \uc2 Continue following our fashion and lifestyle coverage on \uc2 Facebook\uc2  (Styles and Modern Love), \uc2 Twitter\uc2  (Styles, Fashion and Weddings) and \uc2 Instagram\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Because they disagree, Anna Sproul-Latimer and Matt Latimer of Arlington, Va., try not to talk about the presidential race.

\par\par \b \uc2 Election\uc2  2016: \uc2 Clinton\uc2  and Kaine Release Taxes --- Democrat, trying to press rival \uc2 Trump\uc2 , reveals income decline in campaign run-up\b0\par\par\uc2 By Nick Timiraos and Laura Saunders   \par \uc2 703 \uc2 words\par \uc2 13 August 2016\par \uc2 The Wall Street Journal\par \uc2 J\par A4\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  's 2015 tax return showed a sharp drop in income as she launched her presidential campaign, along with a higher federal effective income-tax rate than any president since \uc2 Gerald Ford\uc2  , a sign of caution for a candidate facing intense scrutiny over her family's finances.\par \par \uc2 The return showed Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  and former President \uc2 Bill \uc2 Clinton\uc2  made $10.6 million in adjusted gross income last year, largely from speaking fees, books, and Mr. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's consulting activities.\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 Clinton\uc2  campaign used Friday's disclosures to pressure \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  for refusing to release his tax returns. He has said he won't do so until an audit has been completed, which could make him the first major-party presidential candidate since 1976 to release no returns.\par \par \uc2 The Clintons paid an effective federal income-tax rate of 34% in 2015. Their income was down from $28 million in 2014, when they paid an effective tax rate of more than 35%. According to \uc2 Internal Revenue Service\uc2  data for 2013 returns, the most recent available, taxpayers with adjusted gross incomes of $10 million and above paid an average of 26% in total federal income tax.\par \par \uc2 The latest return showed the Clintons gave more than $1 million, or nearly 10% of their gross income, to charity.\par \par \uc2 Almost all of those donations went to the \uc2 Clinton\uc2  Family Foundation\uc2  , a fund established in 2001 that serves as the vehicle for the couple's charitable giving and is different from the \uc2 Clinton\uc2  Foundation\uc2  , the nonprofit whose activities have been scrutinized. The family foundation made donations worth $3.8 million in 2014, $1.8 million in 2013 and $1 million in 2012.\par \par \uc2 Around half of the giving in 2014 went to the \uc2 Clinton\uc2  Foundation\uc2  , with the rest split between 63 groups that included universities, medical centers, museums and other nonprofits. The \uc2 Clinton\uc2  Foundation\uc2  received around one-quarter of gifts from the smaller family foundation in 2012 and 2013.\par \par \uc2 Joseph Thorndike, a tax historian at Tax Analysts, a nonprofit publisher, said Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  in the latest year had a higher tax rate than any sitting president since Mr. Ford, whose average rate was nearly 38% during his presidency. The lowest average rate belonged to George H.W. Bush, who paid just under 20%.\par \par \uc2 "It's striking that for a rich person, her tax return is very boring," said Len Burman, director of the Tax Policy Center, a nonpartisan think tank that specializes in tax issues, who was a Treasury Department official in the \uc2 Clinton\uc2  administration. "She certainly could afford to pay people to help her figure out ways to avoid paying more in taxes."\par \par \uc2 Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's running mate, Sen. Tim Kaine (D., Va.), released 10 years of his returns. Mr. Kaine and his wife, Anne Holton, paid an effective rate of 20% last year on $313,000 in adjusted gross income.\par \par \uc2 Their rate ranged from as low as 13% in 2009, when they had nearly $180,000 in adjusted gross income during Mr. Kaine's last full year as governor of Virginia, to 24% in 2011, when they reported $256,000 in adjusted gross income.\par \par \uc2 They donated 6.8% of their adjusted gross income to charity last year and 7.5% over the past 10 years. According to \uc2 IRS\uc2  data for 2013 tax returns, taxpayers with adjusted gross incomes of between $200,000 and $500,000 paid an average of nearly 20% in total federal income tax. Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  had previously posted online her returns back to 2007. She and her husband have released returns dating to 1977.\par \par \uc2 In a statement, the \uc2 Trump\uc2  campaign called the release of Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's taxes a "distraction and misdirection" from other controversies that have dogged the former secretary of state, including her use of a private email server while she was in government as well as her office's contacts with the \uc2 Clinton\uc2  Foundation\uc2  .\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's running mate, Indiana Gov. Mike Pence, also hasn't released his tax returns.\par \par \uc2 ---\par \par \uc2 Laura Meckler and Richard Rubin contributed to this article.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=wjco20160813000092"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document J000000020160813ec8d0002g\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 National Desk; SECTA\par \b \uc2 With Senate Up for Grabs, Gauging the \uc2 Trump\uc2  Effect\b0\par\par\uc2 By ADAM PEARCE and KAREN YOURISH \par \uc2 469 \uc2 words\par \uc2 13 August 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 11\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Republicans have more seats up for re-\uc2 election\uc2  this year -- and more where the outcome is uncertain -- than Democrats do. Right now, seven Republican-held seats are considered tossups by the nonpartisan Cook Political Report.\par \par \uc2 In order to get the majority, Democrats need four seats if \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  wins. If she loses, they need five because the vice president gets a Senate vote in the event of a tie.\par \par \uc2 Six of the seats are held by first-term senators who were swept into office as part of a 2010 Republican wave but are also in states that voted for President Obama two years later. The states have a history of voting across party lines. The seventh is the contest in Indiana to fill the seat of Senator Dan Coats, a Republican who is retiring. It became a tossup when \uc2 Evan Bayh\uc2 , the state's former Democratic senator, entered the race.\par \par \uc2 These seven seats would be competitive even if Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  were not the nominee, said Jennifer E. Duffy, who analyzes Senate races for the Cook report. The real question, she said, is whether he has made them even more vulnerable. ''Before the conventions, that didn't really appear to be the case, but since the conventions there has been a lot of volatility in polls.''\par \par \uc2 A primary concern is that opposition to Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  will depress Republican turnout in November. Other than Senator Mark S. Kirk of Illinois, who rescinded his endorsement, the candidates are trying to walk a fine line between saying they support their party's nominee (generally without naming him) and distancing themselves from his controversial statements, in the hope that Republicans will turn out to vote even if they don't support Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Of the seven Republican tossups, Mr. Kirk, running in heavily Democratic Illinois, is the most likely to lose his seat (one that was formerly held by \uc2 Barack Obama\uc2 ), while Rob Portman of Ohio has the best shot at being re-elected, according to polling and previous \uc2 election\uc2  results.\par \par \uc2 Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire, in a tough race with the state's Democratic governor, is one of a handful of Republican senators who have spoken out against Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , though she has said she still supports him.\par \par \uc2 In early August, she said she was ''appalled'' by his comments about the family of a fallen Muslim Army captain. Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , in turn, belittled Ms. Ayotte for not being supportive of his campaign before tepidly endorsing her later in the week, as part of an effort to forge party unity.\par \par \uc2 CHARTS: The Senate State of Play; The Seven Republican Tossup Seats (Sources: Cook Political Report.

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 WASHINGTON -- A hacker believed to be tied to the Russian intelligence services made public another set of internal Democratic Party documents on Friday, including the personal cellphone numbers and email addresses of nearly 200 lawmakers.\par \par \uc2 The files appeared to be less politically embarrassing and damaging than the hacker's initial trove, which came from the \uc2 Democratic National Committee\uc2 . Those documents, released by \uc2 WikiLeaks\uc2  last month on the eve of the party's convention, led to the resignation of the committee's leader, Representative \uc2 Debbie Wasserman Schultz\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 But the emergence of another set of leaked documents threatened to intensify international tensions over Russia's suspected meddling in United States politics.\par \par \uc2 The hacker claiming responsibility for the breach -- working under the pseudonym Guccifer 2.0, which American intelligence officials believe is an alias for a Russian intelligence hacker -- appeared eager to taunt Democrats in releasing the latest files. Those documents came from the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, the fund-raising arm for House Democrats.\par \par \uc2 ''It's time for new revelations now,'' the hacker wrote in posting the files. ''All of you may have heard about the DCCC hack. As you see I wasn't wasting my time! It was even easier than in the case of the \uc2 DNC\uc2  breach.''\par \par \uc2 On Friday night, the hacker indicated that more leaks would follow, writing on Twitter that ''the major trove'' of the House committee documents would be sent to \uc2 WikiLeaks\uc2 . ''Keep following,'' the hacker wrote.\par \par \uc2 While it became known last month that the House committee had been hacked along with the D.N.C., this was the first time its files had become public.\par \par \uc2 In a statement, the House committee said it was investigating the authenticity of the documents and was working with federal law enforcement officials. The F.B.I. is leading the investigation.\par \par \uc2 American intelligence officials said they are virtually certain that Russian intelligence officials were behind the attack. They said that the breach appears to have extended beyond the two Democratic groups to include the personal email accounts of at least 100 Democratic officials.\par \par \uc2 Representative Jim Himes of Connecticut, the top Democrat on the House subcommittee on the \uc2 National Security Agency\uc2  and cybersecurity, said he was not overly concerned that his personal information was released.\par \par \uc2 ''If it's simply my email being sent around, half my constituents have my email,'' he said. ''If it were to turn out that someone was hacking into emails, it would be a different situation. Worse comes to worst I can get a different email or cell number.''\par \par \uc2 Mr. Himes dismissed the idea that the leak could affect his, or anyone else's, \uc2 election\uc2  campaign this year.\par \par \uc2 ''It's hard for me to imagine how just having a bunch of numbers, cellphones and emails would in any way affect the \uc2 election\uc2 ,'' he said. ''It wasn't totally unexpected.''\par \par \uc2 He added that the cybersecurity subcommittee was likely to discuss the hack in more detail, saying the release of personal information made the threat ''feel that much more real'' to members.\par \par \uc2 ''If there were the ability for someone to hack into those accounts, that really gets worrisome,'' he said. ''Someone could cause a lot of damage if they were able to send emails out from a member's account, but I'm not hearing that that's a risk at this point.''\par \par \uc2 The D.N.C. documents that were released last month proved intensely embarrassing for committee officials because they contained emails indicating that party leaders favored \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  as their nominee over her rival, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont.\par \par \uc2 The committee's interim leader, \uc2 Donna Brazile\uc2 , created a special cybersecurity panel this week to guard against future attacks.\par \par \uc2 Much of the latest batch of documents from the House fund-raising committee, including overviews of particular races and campaigns, appeared largely innocuous in comparison to the D.N.C. breach. Beyond the cellphone numbers and email addresses for Democratic lawmakers, the latest release also included passwords for some internal databases.\par \par \uc2 Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's campaign files do not appear to have been directly breached in the cyberattack, but the personal accounts of some campaign officials might have been, and a voting analytics program used by the campaign was opened as part of the D.N.C. breach, officials say.\par \par \uc2 The American authorities remain uncertain whether the electronic break-in to the Democrats' computer systems was intended as fairly routine cyberespionage or as part of an effort to manipulate the presidential \uc2 election\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 The Republican nominee, \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , urged the Russians last month to try to find 33,000 ''missing'' emails from Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's personal server. But after his remark produced an intense backlash, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  said later that he was being sarcastic.\par \par \uc2 Follow The \uc2 New York Times\uc2 's politics and Washington coverage on \uc2 Facebook\uc2  and Twitter, and sign up for the First Draft politics newsletter.\par \par \uc2 Document NYTF000020160813ec8d0004d\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 National Desk; SECTA\par \b \uc2 Trump\uc2 's Other Campaign Foe: The 'Lowest Form of Life' News Media\b0\par\par\uc2 By ALEXANDER BURNS and NICK CORASANITI \par \uc2 1,207 \uc2 words\par \uc2 13 August 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 10\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2  was on the defensive all week, battered from all sides for his heated statements hailing the Second Amendment and linking political opponents to the Islamic State.\par \par \uc2 But on Friday morning, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  rose early to strike back at his favorite adversary.\par \par \uc2 ''Ratings challenged @CNN reports so seriously that I call President Obama (and \uc2 Clinton\uc2 ) 'the founder' of ISIS,'' Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  fumed on \uc2 Twitter\uc2  shortly after dawn. ''THEY DON'T GET SARCASM?''\par \par \uc2 He soon fired off another gibe. ''I love watching these poor, pathetic people (pundits) on television working so hard and so seriously to try and figure me out,'' Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  taunted. ''They can't!''\par \par \uc2 The social-media broadside was no aberration. Long a vehement critic of the political news media, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  has increasingly organized his general-\uc2 election\uc2  effort around antagonizing the press. He dedicates long sections of his speeches and innumerable tweets to savaging individual outlets, and claiming that media bias could effectively ''rig'' the \uc2 election\uc2  for \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 At times, his enthusiasm for venting anger about the news media has seemed to rival his interest in criticizing Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 . In Erie, Pa., on Friday, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  swerved back and forth between attacks on Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  and an extended airing of grievances about the press.\par \par \uc2 The news media, he said, was determined to cover up Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's missteps and highlight his own. (Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  allowed that Fox News, home to several anchors who openly favor his candidacy, was an exception.)\par \par \uc2 ''These people are the lowest form of life, I'm telling you,'' he said, pointing at the journalists covering his rally. ''They are the lowest form of humanity.''\par \par \uc2 In Altoona, Pa., on Friday evening, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  continued his diatribe: ''It is so ridiculous, the pile on,'' he complained of the coverage of his campaign. ''Every single day, story after story after story.''\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's crowd-pleasing allegations of news media malevolence also serve a tactical purpose: Providing him license to revise or play down his remarks. After stating several times this week that he considered Mr. Obama to be the founder of the Islamic State, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  reversed course on Friday with a declaration that he had only been speaking sarcastically and that the press simply did not understand.\par \par \uc2 In Pennsylvania, he reiterated that he had been sarcastic, but added: ''Not that sarcastic, to be honest with you.''\par \par \uc2 Republicans often complain about the national news media, arguing that most reporters and publications are tilted against them. In the 1992 presidential race, Republicans even produced a bumper sticker urging voters to ''annoy the media'' by re-electing President George Bush. And in his 2016 primary campaign, Senator \uc2 Marco Rubio\uc2  of Florida accused the press of being the equivalent of a ''super PAC'' for Democrats.\par \par \uc2 On the Democratic side, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont fulminated this year about the ''corporate media,'' which he described as hostile to liberal ideals. And aides and supporters of Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  routinely complain that reporters treat her unfairly.\par \par \uc2 But the \uc2 Trump\uc2  campaign has made accusations of news media bias a pervasive theme, and has attacked publications and reporters with virulence. Since last year, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  has made a practice of riling up his crowds with mockery of the media, often pointing to the press risers and describing reporters as dishonest.\par \par \uc2 In Erie on Friday, his audience jeered each time Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  mentioned a news outlet, and at one point many in the crowd turned their backs on him to face the press and express their contempt with a variety of shouts and gestures. ''Dinosaur media is failing!'' one man yelled.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's slashing attacks have generated embarrassing scenes for his campaign, as agitated \uc2 Trump\uc2  fans have acted on his goading. On Thursday night, video circulated widely online of an angry \uc2 Trump\uc2  supporter berating reporters and making an obscene gesture in their direction in Kissimmee, Fla. In one instance during the primaries, Katy Tur, a reporter for NBC News, reported she was escorted to her car by the Secret Service after a rally in which Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  assailed her by name.\par \par \uc2 If bashing the media proved an effective way of rallying the Republican base to his side during the primaries, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  must now prove himself to a broader community of voters in the general \uc2 election\uc2 , who are far less preoccupied with the notion of press bias. Republican strategists see Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's offensive mainly as an exercise in thin-skinned defensiveness, rather than a shrewd political strategy.\par \par \uc2 Kevin Madden, a former spokesman for \uc2 Mitt Romney\uc2 's and George W. Bush's presidential campaigns, said Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  was veering away from issues actually weighing on swing voters, which he said were ''economy and security-focused.''\par \par \uc2 ''Whining about media coverage is just that: It's whining,'' Mr. Madden said. Of complaints, Mr. Madden said: ''Any campaign that tells you it makes a difference with swing voters is just lying to themselves and lazy, because it's easier than developing an actual strategy or message.''\par \par \uc2 Still, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  has intensified his comments, and his top surrogates have raced to join him: \uc2 Rudolph W. Giuliani\uc2 , the former New York City mayor, engaged in a tense half-hour colloquy on \uc2 CNN\uc2  on Thursday, insisting that the media had wronged Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  in its treatment of his candidacy. ''A lot of coverage is rigged,'' Mr. Giuliani said.\par \par \uc2 And the \uc2 Trump\uc2  campaign, which for months has kept a list of outlets barred from receiving press credentials to cover his events, has now taken to putting out regular emails that attack newspapers and websites for alleged bias.\par \par \uc2 The emails feature lengthy denunciations of the offending outlet, accompanied by an image of the publication with a red or yellow stamp over it reading: ''Media bias offender.'' The messages also include offensive headlines, highlighted with circles around them, mimicking Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's habit of cutting out newspaper articles and circling in marker what he finds objectionable.\par \par \uc2 Ari Fleischer, the former White House press secretary under Mr. Bush, said Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  was so far behind in the campaign that his fixation on the press was unlikely to help.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Fleischer, who holds that there is an ''overarching ideological edge'' toward Democrats in the media, said Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  was using claims of news media bias to cover for his own missteps. Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's offhand comment about ''Second Amendment people,'' which was widely interpreted as a joke about assassinating politicians, was a case in point, Mr. Fleischer said.\par \par \uc2 ''When I first heard it and then saw the print coverage of it, I thought: This is the media again, taking it too far,'' Mr. Fleischer said. ''And then I watched the video and I thought: What a fool. This is bona fide.

\par\par \uc2 National Desk; SECTA\par \b \uc2 In Detroit's Recovery, Downtown Roars and Neighborhoods Sputter\b0\par\par\uc2 By PETER APPLEBOME; Mary M. Chapman and Amy Haimerl contributed reporting. \par \uc2 1,563 \uc2 words\par \uc2 13 August 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 9\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 DETROIT -- Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2  alighted here Monday. He saw an urban dystopia of poverty, crime and blight, ''the living, breathing example of my opponent's failed economic agenda.'' \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  arrived Thursday. Speaking in suburban Warren, she saw an upbeat comeback story of grit and innovation. ''I just wish my opponent in this \uc2 election\uc2  saw the same Michigan I do,'' she said.\par \par \uc2 Detroit used to be a pretty clear story. It was a symbol of American economic might and then it was a symbol of American urban ruin. But in a place not given to deep philosophizing -- where the literary canon is defined by the razor-edged crime novels of Elmore Leonard -- almost no one here seems entirely sure what to make of this moment's Detroit.\par \par \uc2 There is a building boom, bustling sports stadiums and upscale signifiers like the \uc2 Whole Foods Market\uc2  or the \uc2 Shake Shack\uc2  opening soon that are transforming the areas in and around Detroit's once desolate downtown. Hipster outposts in Midtown and Corktown are drawing young people from the suburbs and afar. The swift exit in 2014 from the city's traumatic bankruptcy has been followed, almost everyone agrees, by significant progress on improving city services long deemed hopeless.\par \par \uc2 But what that means for the rest of the city and who is benefiting have set in motion a layered conversation about development, equity, race and class. It is playing out with particular force here in what was once the nation's fourth-largest city and is now a place at once grappling with poverty, crime and failing schools, but also still animated by the bones of its former glory.\par \par \uc2 The signs of progress in the city's core are hard to miss. Consider the Metropolitan Building, once home to Detroit's jewelers and watchmakers. It has stood vacant, like a ruined medieval castle, since the 1970s, and is now one of dozens of downtown buildings being restored.\par \par \uc2 ''That encapsulates where Detroit is now,'' said \uc2 David Blaszkiewicz\uc2 , president of Invest Detroit, a nonprofit that has invested $251 million in financing for the \uc2 Metropolitan\uc2  and other real estate and business projects over the past 20 years. ''We can make things happen today that we couldn't make happen for the past three or four decades.''\par \par \uc2 The lack of progress is just as noticeable in the sprawl of often dilapidated neighborhoods, baking in the summer heat.\par \par \uc2 At Maison's Fine Food Diner on Detroit's East Side, the city's resurgence seems as distant as the Alps. Yellowing sports memorabilia dating to the boxer Thomas ''Hitman'' Hearns decorates the wall, along with a faded sign reading: ''Out of a job yet? Keep buying foreign.''\par \par \uc2 ''Downtown is 90 percent better than it was 10 years ago, but you go a few blocks in any direction, and it's terrible,'' said Lulzim Shaqiri, whose wife's family has owned the restaurant since 1983. ''You can talk about helping the neighborhoods, but there's really no neighborhood at all here. It's just as dead as dead can be.''\par \par \uc2 Tonya Banks, one of the waitresses, added: ''In Detroit, everyone's on defense. There's not enough to go around, so everyone's against each other.''\par \par \uc2 There are similar concerns throughout Detroit's neighborhoods. ''There have been so many broken promises,'' said Sarida Scott, the executive director of Community Development Advocates of Detroit, which represents neighborhood groups. ''People remember when they were told to just trust. It's not fair to keep going to the community and saying trust us.''\par \par \uc2 Mayor Mike Duggan, who became Detroit's first white mayor in 40 years when he was elected in 2013 and presided over the city's emergence from 17 months in bankruptcy, ran on the platform of ''Every neighborhood has a future.'' He says he is delivering on the promise.\par \par \uc2 ''People in this city understand where we are and where we are going,'' he said. ''This city went from 1.8 million people in the 1950s to less than 700,000 now. There's been a 60-year decline, where we lost more than a million people, and those people who left didn't take their houses with them. So, the magnitude of what we're recovering from is enormous, but the recovery has started.''\par \par \uc2 There is ample evidence that he is right. No one doubts how serious the problems are from the disastrous state of the schools to the threadbare transit system to the challenges of adding enough jobs to fuel a sustainable recovery. But more than 10,000 blighted properties have been demolished, removing dangerous eyesores and usually allowing neighbors to buy the vacant lots for $100. An additional 2,000 homes are being rehabilitated and reoccupied.\par \par \uc2 There are about 5,000 new housing units either planned for construction or being built. Housing prices have ticked up, and the city's toxic foreclosure problem shows signs of improving.\par \par \uc2 In a city notorious for not even being able to even light its streets, more than 62,000 new LED street lamps have been installed. Officials say the whole city will be relit by the end of the year. And the most recent Census Bureau estimate showed the smallest population decline in decades. Officials predict that next year's figures will show a population gain.\par \par \uc2 Many people are buying in. Seven years ago, Dave Kwiatkowski opened the Sugar House craft cocktails bar in the Corktown neighborhood. Now, he runs four other bars or restaurants, with another, The Bad Luck Bar, expected to open in the revitalized Capitol Park area downtown this fall. He said 35 restaurants were set to open in Detroit within the next 18 months.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Kwiatkowski, who is white and grew up in suburban Detroit, said he wanted to be a part of the city's rebirth. ''It was time to put my money where my mouth is,'' he said. ''Also, Detroit's cool. There are easier cities to live in, with more conveniences or whatever, but people who live in Detroit choose to live in Detroit and are excited to. It makes for a very cool vibe.''\par \par \uc2 Others have their doubts. Eric Thomas, who is black and a partner at a local marketing firm, caused a stir in May with a barbed post entitled ''Why I Hate Detroit,'' which began on his \uc2 LinkedIn\uc2  page and then went viral. His focus was the lousy schools, the lack of opportunity for the majority of the city and the weird way the resurgence in relatively privileged warrens, about 5 percent of the city's 140 square miles, is seen as a proxy for the city as a whole.\par \par \uc2 ''To say you love 5% of Detroit is like ordering a hamburger, eating the sesame seeds on the bun, and claiming you love hamburgers,'' he wrote. ''No sir, you like sesame seeds. You love the Tigers. You love 4 miles of Woodward. But Detroit is not what you love.''\par \par \uc2 James Feagin loves Detroit. He is a linebacker-size black man in a white T-shirt, Tigers cap and cargo shorts driving a red Dodge pickup and preaching the grass-roots path to economic renewal. On Thursday he was at Motor City Match, where about 60 aspiring business owners and building owners got together to see what they had to offer one another. It is part of a program that has invested $2 million over the past year to jump-start 40 businesses, most minority-owned, including a vegan soul food restaurant, a family-run butcher shop and a company that trains people for construction jobs.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Feagin works to foster development through the nonprofit \uc2 Detroit Economic Growth Corporation\uc2 , and plans to move forward on his own $15 million development -- townhouses, apartments and lofts with a neighborhood art gallery that is already open down the street from an abandoned Chinese restaurant that looks like a wrecked amusement park ride.\par \par \uc2 He is impatient with all the narratives about Detroit that do not begin and end with the thought that Detroit and all its far-flung tendrils really matter. It was once a great city that fostered an enormous black middle class, most of whom have stuck around through the bad times and expect to be part of Detroit's next act.\par \par \uc2 ''We're a bit spoiled in Detroit, because we have been an African-American community that has prospered, has had safe neighborhoods, that has expected success,'' he said. ''I'm not thinking about some imaginary utopia. I want my childhood for my child in my city, and I'm not willing to be limited by talk about how things are in the rest of America. I don't want Detroit to be like the rest of America. I want Detroit to be like Detroit.''\par \par \uc2 Follow Peter Applebome @applebome on \uc2 Twitter\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 For breaking news and in-depth reporting, follow @NYTNational.\par \par \uc2 The skyline of a booming downtown Detroit is a striking contrast to a community garden and an abandoned building in the city's Brush Park neighborhood.; Carlos Cabrera at Corktown's Sugar House.

\par\par \uc2 National Desk; SECTA\par \b \uc2 Clinton\uc2  and Kaine, Raising Ante, Release More Tax Returns\b0\par\par\uc2 By STEVE EDER and KITTY BENNETT; David Barstow contributed reporting. \par \uc2 1,216 \uc2 words\par \uc2 13 August 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 11\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  and her running mate, Tim Kaine, released a new batch of their own income tax returns on Friday, ratcheting up the pressure on her opponent, \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , to begin making public his own forms.\par \par \uc2 The newest tax return of Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  and her husband, former President \uc2 Bill \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , showed an adjusted gross income of $10.6 million for 2015, a large drop from previous years but still enough to place them in the top 0.1 percent of American households.\par \par \uc2 They paid about $3.6 million in federal taxes for an effective tax rate of about 35 percent.\par \par \uc2 More than half their income came from speeches; Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  also earned $3 million from ''Hard Choices,'' her memoir of her years as secretary of state.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Kaine, the Virginia senator, and his wife, Anne Holton, who was Virginia's secretary of education until she stepped down last month, reported income of $313,441 for 2015.\par \par \uc2 But aside from their earnings, the release was intended to put a spotlight on Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's refusal to release his own returns. \uc2 Mike Pence\uc2 , the Indiana governor and Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's running mate, also has not made public his tax data during the campaign.\par \par \uc2 Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's spokeswoman, Jennifer Palmieri, said in a statement the release sets a ''stark contrast'' with Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , whom she accused of ''hiding behind fake excuses.''\par \par \uc2 ''He has failed to provide the public with the most basic financial information disclosed by every major candidate in the last 40 years,'' she said. ''What is he trying to hide?''\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 Trump\uc2  campaign would not discuss his tax returns, but in a statement on Friday, a spokesman, Jason Miller, called Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's disclosure an effort to shield her from questions about her emails when she was secretary of state and about what favors were sought by donors to her family's foundation.\par \par \uc2 ''This document release is nothing more than an attempt at distraction and misdirection by an individual who created and then purged an illegal private email server,'' he said.\par \par \uc2 If Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  does not make public the details of his taxes, he would be the first major party presidential nominee to decline to do so since Richard M. Nixon. Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  is not required as a candidate to reveal his taxes, but he has submitted his personal financial disclosure form outlining his business interests, which he is obligated to file.\par \par \uc2 While Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  has cited an I.R.S. audit as his reason for not releasing his taxes, the agency said in a statement this year, ''Nothing prevents individuals from sharing their own tax information.''\par \par \uc2 The lack of a disclosure of his taxes has opened Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  to attacks, first during the Republican primary campaign and now in the months leading to the Nov. 8 general \uc2 election\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Critics have questioned whether Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  has not released his taxes because his reported earnings could be underwhelming in comparison to his own statements about his net worth. Others have suggested that the tax documents would reveal business interests that could be problematic if he were elected.\par \par \uc2 There have also been questions about how much Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  has paid in taxes over the years, whether he in fact paid any federal taxes some years, and whether he has followed through on his charitable pledges.\par \par \uc2 Given the expansive web of tax breaks available to real estate developers, tax experts say it would not be surprising if Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  paid little or no income taxes some years, even as he amassed billions of dollars in wealth.\par \par \uc2 The Clintons' income has also brought scrutiny, and their returns hint at how much they have relied on their star power and government connections to catapult them into the ranks of the super rich. Though they were once seen as relatable to average Americans, polls suggest that many voters now see them as out of touch.\par \par \uc2 Their 2015 income, while less than half what they earned the previous year, put them well above the $2 million threshold for the top 0.1 percent of taxpayers, according to an analysis of federal income tax data by Emmanuel Saez, an economics professor at the University of California, Berkeley. They were within $1 million of reaching the 0.01 percent threshold -- or the top 1 percent of the top 1 percent.\par \par \uc2 In recent years they have collected tens of millions of dollars in fees for speeches, including some delivered abroad and others sponsored by financial institutions.\par \par \uc2 Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  has faced calls to release the transcripts of her speeches, particularly from the three she gave for \uc2 Goldman Sachs\uc2  for a total of $675,000. Her primary opponent, Senator Bernie Sanders, and Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  have used those speeches to portray Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  as being chummy with Wall Street.\par \par \uc2 In 2015, before she officially began her campaign and stopped giving speeches, she earned $1.5 million in speaking fees. Her husband earned $5.25 million from speeches last year.\par \par \uc2 According to Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's personal financial disclosure filed in May, she and her husband made more than two dozen speeches in 2015 for $150,000 and up. Mr. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  earned $225,000 for a February speech sponsored by UBS Wealth Management, for example, and Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  gave a speech for \uc2 eBay\uc2  in March for $315,000. Mr. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  also earned $1.7 million from his consulting business, WJC L.L.C., after it brought in more than $6 million the year before, according to the tax returns.\par \par \uc2 The financial disclosure from earlier this year said that two sources of consulting income were Varkey GEMS Foundation, an international charity founded by Sunny Varkey, an education entrepreneur, and Laureate Education, a network of for-profit schools.\par \par \uc2 These financial ties -- including the past speeches, business endeavors and well as donor relationships with the \uc2 Clinton\uc2  Foundation\uc2  -- have already attracted critics who say they include inherent conflicts of interest and could be problematic under a \uc2 Clinton\uc2  administration.\par \par \uc2 From 2007 to 2015, according to returns released Friday and previously, the Clintons made a total adjusted gross income of $150 million and paid $48 million in federal taxes. In the same period they gave $16 million to charity, including $1 million last year that went mostly to their family foundation.\par \par \uc2 The Clintons' other income last year included $24,932 in interest, $84,358 in mutual fund dividends and $226,297 in pension payments from the federal and Arkansas governments.\par \par \uc2 Their deductions included $1.4 million in state income taxes and $98,244 in property taxes on their homes in Chappaqua, N.Y., and Washington. They also wrote off $41,040 in mortgage interest.\par \par \uc2 Find out what you need to know about the 2016 presidential race today, and get politics news updates via \uc2 Facebook\uc2 , \uc2 Twitter\uc2  and the First Draft newsletter.\par \par \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  and Senator Tim Kaine in Columbus, Ohio, last month.

\par\par \uc2 National Desk; SECTA\par \b \uc2 Trump\uc2 's Remarks Cut Into Support in Swing States\b0\par\par\uc2 By PATRICK HEALY; Nick Corasaniti contributed reporting from Erie, Pa. Giovanni Russonello contributed research. \par \uc2 1,665 \uc2 words\par \uc2 13 August 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 1\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 DOYLESTOWN, Pa. -- \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2  has been waiting for months for a poll in which he cracks 50 percent of the vote against \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  in any of his top battleground states: Florida, New Hampshire, Ohio or Pennsylvania.\par \par \uc2 ''It'll happen after the conventions,'' he said in a July 6 interview. ''Believe me.''\par \par \uc2 But in the last two weeks, instead of attracting a surge of new admirers, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  has been hemorrhaging support among loyal Republicans, anti-establishment independents, \uc2 Clinton\uc2 -loathing Democrats and others, according to polls and 30 interviews with a cross-section of voters. His dispute with the parents of a Muslim Army captain who was killed in action in Iraq, and his suggestion that ''Second Amendment people'' could somehow stop Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , have intensified doubts about Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  even among Americans who were initially attracted to his frank and freewheeling style.\par \par \uc2 For a candidate who once seemed like an electoral phenomenon, with an unshakable following and a celebrity appeal that crossed party lines, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  now faces the possibility that his missteps have erected a ceiling over his support among some demographic groups and in several swing states. He has been stuck under 45 percent of the vote in Ohio and Pennsylvania for weeks, polls show, while Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  has gained support.\par \par \uc2 Several Republican voters say they grow leery every time Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  speaks these days, for fear he will embarrass them, and feel increasingly repelled just when they hoped he might adjust his message to try to draw more people in. ''I liked that he was politically incorrect. But now I feel, enough already,'' Trish Grove, a banker, said as she finished lunch at a diner here in Doylestown, a bellwether suburb north of Philadelphia. ''He's not going to win a majority of voters by sounding offensive and ridiculous.''\par \par \uc2 After the conventions in late July, Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's support among young people rose 12 percent, and she gained ground among liberals and moderates, according to an analysis of a New York Times/CBS News poll before the conventions and a \uc2 CBS News\uc2  poll after them. Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  improved only with voters who held bachelor's degrees but did not attend graduate school.\par \par \uc2 ''Undecided voters still have a long way to go before they vote for \uc2 Trump\uc2 ,'' said \uc2 Frank Luntz\uc2 , a Republican strategist who holds focus groups with voters. ''He has high unfavorable ratings with so many voters that he would need to win most of the rest of the electorate, and his post-convention problems aren't helping him grow.''\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's troubles are perhaps most pronounced in Pennsylvania, which he has targeted for victory in November even though the state has gone Democratic in the last six presidential elections. He is running strong in the traditionally conservative western part of the state, and his advisers argue that his populist views on trade, immigration and foreign policy could resonate with independents and blue-collar Democrats.\par \par \uc2 ''We have to win Pennsylvania,'' Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  said on Friday during a campaign rally in Erie. ''We win Pennsylvania, we're going to win it,'' apparently a reference to the presidency.\par \par \uc2 But to carry the state, pollsters say, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  would need to beat Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  here in the Philadelphia suburbs, where President Obama defeated \uc2 Mitt Romney\uc2  in 2012 by about nine percentage points. (Mr. Obama carried the state by about five points.) Yet Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  holds a wide lead in those suburbs, 52 percent to 26 percent, according to an NBC News/Wall Street Journal/Marist College poll published Wednesday.\par \par \uc2 ''There is absolutely no way \uc2 Trump\uc2  wins Pennsylvania unless he can broaden his appeal significantly and overcome his huge deficit in the suburbs,'' said G. Terry Madonna, director of the Franklin & Marshall College poll and a longtime analyst of Pennsylvania politics. ''He does well with white working-class voters, but there simply aren't enough of them in Pennsylvania to win. And he can't stick with his political message for more than five minutes.''\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's advisers expressed confidence in their strategy and questioned whether public polls fully reflect his support. While some did express concern that there could be a ceiling on his support among women and members of minority groups, they also said he had room to grow among first-time voters, white men and independents -- who, they said, will not pay attention to the race until the presidential debates begin in late September.\par \par \uc2 Paul Manafort\uc2 , Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's campaign chairman, said the debates would be critical to winning over voters, but he also pointed to increased spending by the \uc2 Clinton\uc2  campaign on television ads in Pennsylvania and Ohio as proof of the threat Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  poses there.\par \par \uc2 ''We expect to do very well in the suburbs, which will help us to carry Pennsylvania,'' Mr. Manafort said. ''The demographics are very positive for \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  and the issue agenda favors \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  in Pennsylvania.''\par \par \uc2 A \uc2 Clinton\uc2  campaign spokesman did not respond to a request for comment, but several of Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's advisers and allies said they were highly optimistic that she would carry Pennsylvania and most other Rust Belt states.\par \par \uc2 There are few greater threats to candidates than a ceiling on their support, which is why many take more moderate positions during the general \uc2 election\uc2  in hopes of appealing to the broadest possible constituency. Republicans and Democrats have a history of nominating presidential candidates genial and ideologically flexible enough to expand their support beyond party loyalists.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  and Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  have historically high unfavorability ratings and extremely low favorability ratings among undecided voters. Yet since the conventions, Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  has focused her message and campaign schedule on undecided voters in swing states. Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  has shown little interest in changing his unorthodox approach: In an interview on CNBC on Thursday he said he would ''just keep doing the same thing I'm doing right now,'' even if he ended up losing.\par \par \uc2 Many Republican-leaning voters here in \uc2 Bucks County\uc2  said in interviews that Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  seemed almost to be willfully trying to alienate them: He says the right things about repealing the Affordable Care Act and cutting taxes, but then appears to revel in insulting women and Mexicans and singling out Muslims for harsh treatment. Several voters also cited Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's mocking of a disabled reporter, and others said that he seemed too hotheaded in confrontational situations, such as when he came under criticism from Khizr Khan, the father of the United States Army officer killed in Iraq, during his speech at the Democratic convention.\par \par \uc2 ''America's role in the world matters to me, and I don't want a president who yells at other people,'' said Adam Woldow, a dermatologist in Richboro, Pa., who said he voted for Mr. Romney in 2012 and \uc2 John McCain\uc2  in 2008.\par \par \uc2 As he waited for his station wagon to emerge from a carwash, Dr. Woldow paused to consider why Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  bothered him so much. ''He just has so much baggage at this point, all the things he keeps saying,'' he said. ''I feel he's even a bit racist.'' Dr. Woldow said he was leaning toward \uc2 Gary Johnson\uc2 , the Libertarian candidate.\par \par \uc2 Penny Clendaniel-Bullaro, an independent from Morrisville, Pa., who also voted for Mr. Romney, said she was dismayed when Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  insinuated that Mr. Khan's wife, Ghazala, had not been ''allowed'' to speak when she appeared alongside him at the convention.\par \par \uc2 ''Who is \uc2 Trump\uc2  to make these judgments? \uc2 Trump\uc2  speaks all the time with his own wife by his side, silent,'' Ms. Clendaniel-Bullaro said while perusing the lunch menu at a diner in Doylestown. ''He should be talking about issues if he wants to actually win people over.''\par \par \uc2 But Mariann Davies, a lawyer in Doylestown who supports Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , predicted that his popularity would grow among voters who do not want Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  to continue the Obama administration's policies.\par \par \uc2 ''He's talking about the issues everyone is pussyfooting around,'' Ms. Davies said of Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 . ''I think he could attract more voters if he would just focus on trade policy and jobs because people around here care a lot about those things.''\par \par \uc2 For most politicians, a call-it-as-you-see-it approach has limits: Candidates who offend too many voters, or look overly impulsive or intemperate, generally lose. But Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  believes that voters who have seen hard times in their communities will embrace him as a truth teller.\par \par \uc2 In the blue-collar cities of northeast Pennsylvania, a traditionally Democratic area where Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  would need to overperform, several voters said they were skeptical of his leadership skills even though they shared his concerns about immigration and national security.\par \par \uc2 Ody Draklellis, a Republican who owns the Queen City Diner in Allentown, said people in the area were open to Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  because they mistrusted Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  and were tired of Mr. Obama's policies. But Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's main problem, Mr. Draklellis added, ''is Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  himself.''\par \par \uc2 ''Could \uc2 Trump\uc2  be a good president? Probably. But he might get us into a war, so the risk is too high,'' said Mr. Draklellis, who has not chosen a candidate. ''You would think he'd be totally focused on all of Hillary's vulnerabilities. He could grow in the polls that way. Instead he just shoots his mouth off.''\par \par \uc2 Find out what you need to know about the 2016 presidential race today, and get politics news updates via \uc2 Facebook\uc2 , \uc2 Twitter\uc2  and the First Draft newsletter.\par \par \uc2 Top, supporters waiting for Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2  to speak Wednesday in Sunrise, Fla., a battleground state.

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 A hacker posted cellphone numbers and other personal information of nearly 200 current and former congressional Democrats on Friday, the latest public disclosure of sensitive records this \uc2 election\uc2  season.\par \par \uc2 The hacker, or group of hackers, going by the name "Guccifer 2.0" said the records were stolen as part of a breach of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. A number of files were posted onto Guccifer 2.0's website, including a spreadsheet that has information for 193 people, such as phone numbers or email addresses. The cellphone numbers of House Minority Leader \uc2 Nancy Pelosi\uc2  of California and Democratic Whip Steny Hoyer of Maryland were among the information posted.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Hoyer, reached on the number listed on the spreadsheet, said he wasn't aware that this information had been stolen or posted online. "This is the first I've heard of it, obviously," he said Friday.\par \par \uc2 Word began to spread Friday evening among Democrats whose personal information was posted, and several became furious, a congressional staffer said. Not all the information appeared to be correct, as at least one email address listed on the spreadsheet was no longer current.\par \par \uc2 The posting of the cellphone numbers and personal email addresses has national security implications. Included in the spreadsheet were the personal information of members of the House Intelligence, Armed Services and Foreign Relations Committees. Foreign spies could use that information to try to intercept sensitive communications.\par \par \uc2 The DCCC breach was reported late last month. In June, Guccifer claimed responsibility for hacking the \uc2 Democratic National Committee\uc2  and posting an opposition research document of Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  online.\par \par \uc2 A number of U.S. intelligence officials believe the most likely culprit for stealing the DCCC data, as well as a large batch of records from the \uc2 Democratic National Committee\uc2 , are hackers backed by the Russian government. At least one cybersecurity company has said there appear to be links between the Russians and the entity identifying itself as Guccifer 2.0, although the hacker has denied being connected to Moscow.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=wjco20160813000117"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document J000000020160813ec8d00034\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw272\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4080\pichgoal600

\par\par \b \uc2 Pence Woos \uc2 Trump\uc2  Skeptics\b0\par\par\uc2 By Reid J. Epstein   \par \uc2 1,052 \uc2 words\par \uc2 13 August 2016\par \uc2 The Wall Street Journal\par \uc2 J\par A1\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 A week after Republican presidential nominee \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  threatened last month to put money into a super PAC to end the political careers of former rivals Ted Cruz and John Kasich, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's running mate, \uc2 Mike Pence\uc2 , called each of them to try to make peace.\par \par \uc2 While Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  has exacerbated intraparty tensions, Mr. Pence is trying to persuade GOP stalwarts to rally behind the party's presidential ticket.\par \par \uc2 The task has taken him from the private office of former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush to a Phoenix airport meeting with embattled Arizona Sen. John McCain. He has tried to charm hostile talk-radio hosts, whose ranks he once belonged to, and even low-ranking state party officials.\par \par \uc2 His pitch is subdued and often aimed at reminding his fellow Republicans about what unites them, including old friendships and alliances, according to people with whom he has spoken. The \uc2 Trump\uc2 -Pence partnership is also reversing the longstanding roles of nominee and running mate, as Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  leads the attack on Democratic rivals \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  and her vice-presidential pick, Virginia Sen. Tim Kaine.\par \par \uc2 "Mending fences isn't usually part of a vice-presidential nominee'sjob," said Mike Steel, who was an aide to House Speaker \uc2 Paul Ryan\uc2  when Mr. Ryan was Republican \uc2 Mitt Romney\uc2 's running mate in 2012. "But we've never before seen a nominee like \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2 , who has alienated huge swaths of the party."\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  hasn't given Mr. Pence an explicit mandate to conduct the peacemaking expeditions, Pence aides said, but the low-key Indiana governor has kept \uc2 the New Yorker\uc2  abreast of his discussions.\par \par \uc2 The meetings and phone calls illuminate the difference between Mr. Pence's experience as a career politician and Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's life in real estate, where victory comes with the defeat of a rival.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Pence's quiet diplomacy can serve dual purposes: quelling intraparty divisions and preserving relationships he may need in the future if the 2016 \uc2 election\uc2  doesn't turn out as he hopes.\par \par \uc2 "Mike has longstanding relationships with many of these people, and part of his role is to unify the party," Pence spokesman Marc Short said. The \uc2 Trump\uc2  campaign didn't respond to a request for comment.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Pence's record so far has been mixed. Iowa Rep. Steve King, who was one of Mr. Cruz's staunchest supporters, threw his support behind Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  last week after Mr. Pence met with him in Iowa.\par \par \uc2 Yet Mr. Pence's toughest challenges have been Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's former presidential rivals, who are still smarting from months of insults from the nominee.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Pence and Texas Sen. Mr. Cruz spoke by phone late last week, according to people familiar with the call. Mr. Pence called Mr. Kasich, the Ohio governor, but got his voice mail. Mr. Kasich returned the call and left a message. The two haven't connected since, according to aides to both men.\par \par \uc2 Perhaps no presidential candidate was damaged more by Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  than Mr. Bush, on whom Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  stuck the label "low energy" last summer. The former governor, along with his father and brother, both former Republican presidents, have refused to endorse Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 But Mr. Bush took a meeting with Mr. Pence on July 27 in Coral Gables, Fla., at the Biltmore Hotel, where the former Florida governor keeps his personal office. Aides to Messrs. Pence, Bush, Cruz and Kasich declined to comment on the specifics of their conversations.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Pence's approach to \uc2 Trump\uc2  skeptics is a soft sell.\par \par \uc2 To Charlie Sykes, an influential Wisconsin conservative talk-radio host who has made a cottage industry out of his opposition to Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , Mr. Pence stressed his own background in radio when they spent a half-hour together last month at the Milwaukee airport.\par \par \uc2 "It was not like a hard pitch," Mr. Sykes said. "There were no apologies for Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 . It was, 'Hey look, I'm one of you, a conservative. I'm a \uc2 Paul Ryan\uc2  guy.'"\par \par \uc2 A week later, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  toyed with the notion of refusing to endorse Mr. Ryan, the House speaker, in his Wisconsin primary. The next day, Mr. Pence endorsed his friend and onetime House colleague.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  ultimately came around to backing the speaker, who easily won his primary. But the speaker and the nominee haven't spoken since then. Meanwhile, Mr. Pence and Mr. Ryan have had several conversations, aides said.\par \par \uc2 During a recent campaign swing through Arizona, Mr. Pence went to dinner with GOP Sen. Jeff Flake, who has refused to endorse Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 "He talked about the ticket. I certainly respect him," Mr. Flake saidSundayduring an interview on \uc2 CBS\uc2 . Mr. Pence's pitch, Mr. Flake said, was that "\uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  is a different guy in private than he has shown in public. He made a good case." Mr. Flake still hasn't backed Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Along with political foes, Mr. Pence and his team are in communication with officials at the \uc2 U.S. Chamber of Commerce\uc2 , which is mired in a political skirmish with Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  over trade policy.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Pence's aides check in with the Chamber's senior political strategist, Scott Reed, "for analysis on what is really going on," Mr. Reed said.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Pence's attempts at political reconciliation have only gone so far. He hasn't reached out to Nebraska Sen. Ben Sasse, the loudest and most consistent \uc2 Trump\uc2  critic in Congress, a Sasse aide said. He also hasn't called New Hampshire Sen. Kelly Ayotte, a Republican in a tough re-\uc2 election\uc2  race whom Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  also endorsed belatedly.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Short said Mr. Pence is reaching out to \uc2 Trump\uc2 -wary Republicans as his schedule and travels permit -- and when problems suddenly emerge.\par \par \uc2 When first-term Ohio state legislatorNiraj Antanithis past week was refused entry to a campaign event near Dayton because he had posted tweets favorable to Mr. Kasich, Mr. Pence called him after the event.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Antani said Mr. Pence apologized and praised Mr. Kasich, saying that as neighboring governors they became friendly. "He said Kasich is a good friend of his and that he wants to unify the party," Mr. Antani said. "I'm going to probably vote for him now."\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=wjco20160813000107"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document J000000020160813ec8d0002v\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw272\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4080\pichgoal600

He also lashed out at media organizations for the way they covered the remarks.\par \par \uc2 "Of course I'm being sarcastic," Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  said in Erie. "And [the media] know that because after I said that, I said he's the [most valuable player], he's going to collect his MVP award," referring to a radio interview on his comments about the president. Later he added, "But not that sarcastic, to be honest with you."\par \par \uc2 In his tweets, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  continued a line of attack on Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  claiming the terrorist group gained power while she was secretary of state. "ISIS gained tremendous strength during \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's term as Secretary of State. When will the dishonest media report the facts!" he said on \uc2 Twitter\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's comments in Erie were a shift from statements he made Thursday, when he stood by his original claim at the Florida rally that the president and former secretary of state founded ISIS, the terrorist group also known as Islamic State.\par \par \uc2 When asked on Thursday by radio talk-show host Hugh Hewitt if he meant to say that Mr. Obama indirectly created ISIS by pulling troops from Iraq, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  said, "No."\par \par \uc2 "I meant he's the founder of ISIS," Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  said. "He was the most valuable player."\par \par \uc2 Jake Sullivan, the \uc2 Clinton\uc2  campaign's senior policy adviser, said in a statement Thursday that Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's allegation was "a false claim from a presidential candidate with an aversion to the truth and an unprecedented lack of knowledge."\par \par \uc2 The White House declined to comment.\par \par \uc2 ---\par \par \uc2 Beth Reinhard contributed to this article.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=wjco20160813000094"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document J000000020160813ec8d0002i\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw272\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4080\pichgoal600

\par\par \b \uc2 Running to Survive in the Year of \uc2 Trump\b0\par\par\uc2 By Joseph Rago   \par \uc2 2,003 \uc2 words\par \uc2 13 August 2016\par \uc2 The Wall Street Journal\par \uc2 J\par A11\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 Milwaukee -- 'Five three two oh six. Look it up. We are one of the most incarcerated zip codes in the country. We have some of the most negative statistics here in Milwaukee and in Wisconsin," says Orlando Owens, a community advocate and until recently the director of African-American outreach for the Wisconsin Republican Party. "Crime-stricken," interjects Pastor Jerome Smith, of the Greater Praise Church of God in Christ. "Murders. Drop-out rates. Drug addictions," Mr. Owens continues. "We don't have a lot of sunshine."\par \par \uc2 This view of the predominantly black 53206 zip code, on Milwaukee's north side, is reflected in the official statistics. The University of Wisconsin's Center for Economic Development reports that unemployment for working-age men is about 64%. Median real household income has dived by 17% since 2000 to $22,962, and two-thirds of local kids live in poverty.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Owens notes these are the familiar "challenges you see in urban America" that nonetheless stand out "for a city and a population that's so small." Across the street from the Greater Praise sanctuary is a vacant lot and a boarded-up building that used to house several businesses.\par \par \uc2 The paradox, or the tragedy, is that there are tens of thousands of unfilled manufacturing and other entry-level positions in Wisconsin. Seven of 10 state CEOs had trouble finding enough qualified workers, the Wisconsin Manufacturers & Commerce trade group found in a July survey, and demand is rising.\par \par \uc2 To try to resolve this mismatch between potential workers and the businesses that want to hire them, Mr. Owens and Pastor Smith last year started a partnership called the Joseph Project that has already seen some early notable successes. They've also got an unlikely partner -- Ron Johnson, Wisconsin's Republican senator.\par \par \uc2 Pastor Smith first met Mr. Owens when Mr. Owens was with the state GOP, which he left to join Mr. Johnson's staff. "I get a call, and I'm like, OK, who's Ron Johnson? Well, you know, he's a U.S. senator. I said, oh, you mean Tammy Baldwin?" Pastor Smith recalled, laughing, in an interview this week at Greater Praise.\par \par \uc2 If humanitarianism to mitigate concentrated poverty is unusual for a conventional Republican -- at least according to the political caricature -- then Mr. Johnson's party affiliation may also be a liability as he runs for a second term in the era of \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2 . The Wisconsin Senate campaign spotlights the larger importance of 2016, and Mr. Johnson could be caught in an anti-\uc2 Trump\uc2  downdraft.\par \par \uc2 The senator and former plastics-making executive isn't one to put an extra brush of varnish on a situation. Yet in an interview at his campaign headquarters in Waukesha, he says the Joseph Project is far more meaningful than mere politics: "It is a joy, being able to participate in that, seeing people's lives be turned around. That's true conservative values and they work. You outsource compassion to the federal government, that doesn't work so good. You show your compassion here in your community, one person at a time."\par \par \uc2 The Joseph Project began amid a confluence: Mr. Johnson was traveling around Wisconsin, and, he says, "not one manufacturer could hire enough people. But we've got all this inner-city unemployment, guys, how can you make that connection?" Meanwhile, Pastor Smith and Mr. Owens heard an appeal from the Sheboygan County Economic Development Corp., which was trying to fill 4,000 factory jobs. They made a tour of companies like Nemak (auto parts), Pace (aluminum die casting), Kohler (bathroom fixtures) and Johnsonville (sausage).\par \par \uc2 Sheboygan County is more than an hour's drive north of Milwaukee, and already on the ride back Mr. Owens and Pastor Smith were formulating a plan. They drew on the insights of the black conservative intellectual Bob Woodson, who in his 2007 book "The Triumphs of Joseph" chronicled "local people finding local solutions to their local needs in their communities. These were not big-name organizations and big-name foundations; these were small ministries, small nonprofits started in someone's church, started in someone's attic, and they went out and did the work," Mr. Owens says.\par \par \uc2 The duo figured they could connect unemployed or underemployed Milwaukeeans with the Sheboygan companies and use church vans that were unused during the workweek for transportation. They devised a week-long curriculum of workshops, taught by church members and Mr. Johnson's Senate staff as a constituent service. The workshops focused on "soft skills," like how to interview, the work ethic, financial and time management, and conflict resolution, Mr. Owens says. "We're not teaching them how to weld, how to type -- "\par \par \uc2 "The simple things," says Pastor Smith.\par \par \uc2 Admittance to the Joseph Project is competitive, and Mr. Owens and Pastor Smith set high expectations and vet candidates. Those who persevere are promised an interview with an HR department on Friday, nothing more.\par \par \uc2 Fifteen people took part in the first class in October 2015, and 13 were offered a job and began work. Of the 130 people who have completed the program, 77 are now working with another 28 offers pending. Wages are well above the minimum, running between $12.80 and $18.50 an hour, and the vans run five shifts a day and average 12,000 miles a month.\par \par \uc2 Economically speaking, the Joseph Project removes friction from the labor market and solves a human-capital problem for employers. Since the best type of skills training happens on the job, for workers the program helps break "the cycle of cycle of poverty and despair," as Mr. Johnson puts it.\par \par \uc2 The project also has better recruiting and retention outcomes than the notorious archipelago of federal job training. Before a modest 2014 reform, there were 47 overlapping such programs. The \uc2 Government Accountability Office\uc2  found that only five could show any positive effects, and even those were "small, inconclusive or restricted to short-term impacts."\par \par \uc2 "Some of them go as far as giving you a really nice certificate of completion and attached to that pretty certificate is a piece of paper with a bunch of companies' names on it," says Pastor Smith. "You can get that out of the Yellow Pages. That has no value, you know what I mean?\par \par \uc2 "Relationships -- that's where the value is, and that's what we do, and that's what sets us apart," he says. Companies over time are coming to trust applicants with the Joseph Project imprimatur. Mr. Johnson's involvement includes helping to broker these relationships -- 17 companies now participate.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Johnson's endorsement, in turn, has encouraged companies to show case-by-case flexibility on criminal backgrounds. A 2007 University of Wisconsin study found that by age 30-34 only 38% of men in 53206 had not spent time in a state correctional facility. "Are the owners of these companies willing to say, let's give this guy another shot?" Mr. Owens asks. "He said he wants to work. He has the same probationary period like everybody else. . . . He may have some bumps and some bruises. But what you've got are some tough-minded, gritty people who will not give up, who will not tap out easily. They've been through challenges before, they see the opportunity and go for it."\par \par \uc2 "Almost all these individuals are in a position where they've got to put their pasts behind them and move forward," explains Mr. Johnson. "Probably for the first time in his life not only does he have the dignity of earning his own success, but he has that added dignity and joy of doing something that's going to benefit somebody he doesn't even know."\par \par \uc2 Because success builds on success, the faith-based program teaches a sense of spiritual solidarity. "The Joseph Project is really bigger than just you," Mr. Owens says. "It's really about the next person behind you, keeping the door open for the next person behind you."\par \par \uc2 Pastor Smith adds: "The Joseph Project is making impacts on people's lives. Because there is a thing called the Joseph Project, because of all the hard work that the senator is putting in, because of the people behind the scenes, that the church does, guess what: Somebody is going to eat tonight."\par \par \uc2 ---\par \par \uc2 "Of all the stuff I've done in six years, if nothing else, this was worth it," Mr. Johnson says of the Joseph Project. "I'm telling you, this [running for re-\uc2 election\uc2 ] is such a negative process. It is: the frustration and not being able to get stuff done and the negative campaigning, the way they try to destroy your character. This was worth it."\par \par \uc2 This \uc2 election\uc2  may test Mr. Johnson's proposition, and among Republican political analysts the race inspires ambient dread. He's probably the most vulnerable GOP senator after Illinois's Mark Kirk. Democrats need to retake four seats to control the now 54-46 chamber if \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  wins the White House.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Johnson was elected in the 2010 tea-party wave, defeating 18-year incumbent Russ Feingold in one of that year's biggest upsets. Now Mr. Feingold is back, and presidential \uc2 election\uc2  years tend to bring out Democrat-leaning voters in Wisconsin. The last Republican to win the state was Ronald Reagan in 1984. Then again, no ousted senator has won a direct re-match since 1934.\par \par \uc2 Democrats are trying to wrap Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  around Mr. Johnson like a boa constrictor, and \uc2 the New Yorker\uc2  is exceptionally unpopular in the Badger State. In the \uc2 Marquette University\uc2  poll released this week, he's viewed favorably by 27% of registered voters. In the same poll, Mr. Feingold is beating Mr. Johnson, 49% to 43%.\par \par \uc2 But the race has narrowed in recent months, and Mr. Johnson is running as an independent, pragmatic outsider keyed in on solving problems particular to Wisconsinites. He supports Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  over Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 . "Some people you disagree with more than others, but my approach really throughout my life, throughout my business career: I concentrate on the areas of agreement. It's far more productive," Mr. Johnson says.\par \par \uc2 He raised $2.8 million in the most recent quarter, which puts him in a top-three league with the GOP fundraising powerhouses Rob Portman and Pat Toomey, and he portrays Mr. Feingold as a career politician whose ambition to return to Washington is a little unseemly. "This is no different from 2010. I knew I was down. Ended up winning by five," Mr. Johnson notes.\par \par \uc2 "When I get in front of people, I can convince them. I think they see my true intentions here, which is to solve these problems. I'm not doing this because I want to be a U.S. senator . . . Truth of the matter, I'd rather go home. Who wouldn't? Well, Russ Feingold. What normal person? I miss my old life. This is a grind, but it's an important grind. I know there aren't enough people in Washington, D.C., who aren't worried about their re-\uc2 election\uc2 ."\par \par \uc2 Standing in the Greater Praise parking lot, Orlando Owens loops his forefinger around in the air and notes that, whatever you say about Republicans, Ron Johnson isn't the author of this. The first-term senator didn't board up the businesses, or cause the bad schools, the violence or the lack of economic opportunity. But he's trying to work his way to a better answer than the liberal Milwaukee status quo of Russ Feingold and all the Democratic aldermen and county executives. He deserves more time, Mr. Owens says.\par \par \uc2 The greatest political misfortune of 2016 may have nothing to do with the White House. It will be if Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  takes decent men like Mr. Johnson down with him as collateral damage.\par \par \uc2 ---\par \par \uc2 Mr. Rago is a member of the Journal's editorial board.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=wjco20160813000086"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document J000000020160813ec8d0002b\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw272\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4080\pichgoal600

\par\par \b \uc2 Election\uc2  2016: Democrat's Lead Widens in Battlegrounds\b0\par\par\uc2 By Janet Hook   \par \uc2 627 \uc2 words\par \uc2 13 August 2016\par \uc2 The Wall Street Journal\par \uc2 J\par A4\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 Democratic presidential nominee \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  is opening a wider lead in three battleground states, while maintaining an advantage over Republican rival \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  in Florida, a new Wall Street Journal/NBC News/Marist poll has found.\par \par \uc2 In Colorado, Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  leads Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  by 14 percentage points, 46% to 32% -- six points more than a poll taken in July before the two parties held their national conventions.\par \par \uc2 Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  also gained some ground in two Southern battleground states: Virginia, where she leads 46% to 33%, and North Carolina, where she is ahead 48% to 39%.\par \par \uc2 In Florida, one of the most important states this fall with its 29 Electoral College votes, the race is tighter. Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's support stands at 44%, compared with 39% for Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , which is a slight improvement in his position from a month ago, when the poll had him trailing 2 points further behind.\par \par \uc2 Still, even winning Florida in November wouldn't help Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  if his fortunes don't improve in the other battlegrounds. North Carolina is a state that \uc2 Mitt Romney\uc2  won in 2012, and Colorado and Virginia have been trending Democratic in presidential elections. Democrats' position in Virginia is also likely enhanced by Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's selection of the state's popular junior senator, Tim Kaine, to be her running mate.\par \par \uc2 "These are supposed to be battleground states, but right now, they don't look that way," said Lee Miringoff, director of the Marist College Institute for Public Opinion. "\uc2 Trump\uc2  still needs to unify Republicans and better position himself among traditional GOP groups in order to make the contest competitive in these must-win states."\par \par \uc2 The results reinforce the findings of other national and state polls taken in the past two weeks: In the wake of the two parties' conventions and amid a series of setbacks for the \uc2 Trump\uc2  campaign, Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  has consolidated her base and widened her lead on a number of fronts.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  showed some resilience in overcoming rough patches in the Republican primary. But it is unclear whether the broader general-\uc2 election\uc2  electorate will be as tolerant of his confrontational style as the core GOP constituency that won him the party's nomination.\par \par \uc2 Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  also continues to hold a strong position in all four states when the field of choices is broadened to include Libertarian nominee \uc2 Gary Johnson\uc2  and Green Party candidate Jill Stein. In a four-way race, Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  draws more than 40% of the vote in all four states. In two, Colorado and Virginia, Mr. Johnson breaks into the double digits.\par \par \uc2 The poll also found that voters in all four states continue to have unfavorable impressions of both major-party nominees. For Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , her negative ratings range from 52%, in Florida, to 59%, in Colorado. Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's negative ratings range from 62%, in North Carolina, to 69%, in Colorado.\par \par \uc2 The battleground poll released Friday, and earlier Marist polls taken in Iowa, Ohio and Pennsylvania, illustrates Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's difficult standing not just in national polls but also in the states that will be crucial to building an Electoral College majority.\par \par \uc2 There are signs of trouble for other Republicans in North Carolina. Democratic candidate Deborah Ross has pulled to a small lead over GOP Sen. Richard Burr, 46% to 44%, a month after trailing him by 7 percentage points. North Carolina Gov. Pat McCrory is losing ground to Democrat \uc2 Roy Cooper\uc2 , who leads 51% to 44%.\par \par \uc2 In one bright spot for Republicans, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio widened his lead over likely Democratic nominee Patrick Murphy by 3 percentage points, with his support at 49% to Mr. Murphy's 43%.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=wjco20160813000093"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document J000000020160813ec8d0002h\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw272\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4080\pichgoal600

\par\par \b \uc2 Deep, Swift China Shock Drove \uc2 Trump\uc2 's Support --- Many U.S. areas are still suffering from aftermath of import boom; resentment in Hickory, N.C.\b0\par\par\uc2 By Bob Davis and Jon Hilsenrath   \par \uc2 2,316 \uc2 words\par \uc2 12 August 2016\par \uc2 The Wall Street Journal\par \uc2 J\par A1\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 HICKORY, N.C. -- In the late 1990s, this furniture-making hub seemed sheltered from the disruptive forces of globalization. Laid-off steelworkers from West Virginia, Tennessee and beyond streamed here for new jobs building beds, tables and chairs for American homes. The unemployment rate fell below 2%.\par \par \uc2 These days, Hickory is still suffering from a series of economic shocks, none more powerful than China's rise as an export power. The invasion of imported furniture drove factories out of business, erased thousands of jobs and helped drive unemployment above 15% in 2010.\par \par \uc2 Stuart Shoun, 59 years old, has been laid off three times since 1999. After one layoff, the Hickory machinist studied architecture at a community college but then couldn't find a job and returned to the furniture industry. He makes $45,000 a year, the same as he did nearly 20 years ago and $14,000 a year poorer after adjusting for inflation.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Shoun's son, Steven, a trained furniture upholsterer, manages a junkyard and discourages his own son, now in college, from working in the industry that gave North Carolina the nickname "Furniture Capital of the World." Steven Shoun says he blames "the people who run our country and who run our companies" for Hickory's economic turmoil.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Shoun and his father say they favor \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  for president, even though they don't plan to vote. "I don't think one vote will make any difference," says Stuart Shoun.\par \par \uc2 When import booms from Japan, Mexico and Asian "tiger" economies such as Taiwan arrived in the U.S., many cities and towns were able to adapt.\par \par \uc2 China was different. Its emergence as a trade powerhouse rattled the American economy more violently than economists and policy makers anticipated at the time or realized for years later. The U.S. workforce adapted more slowly than expected.\par \par \uc2 What happened with Chinese imports is an example of how much of the conventional wisdom about economics that held sway in the late 1990s, including the role of trade, technology and central banking, has since slowly unraveled.\par \par \uc2 The aftershocks are sowing deep-seated political discontent this \uc2 election\uc2  year. Disillusionment with globalization has fed one of the most unconventional political seasons in modern history, with Bernie Sanders and especially \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  tapping into potent anti-free-trade sentiment.\par \par \uc2 Both presidential candidates aimed much of their criticism at 1994's \uc2 North American Free Trade Agreement\uc2 , which boosted imports from Mexico. Even then, though, the real culprit was China, economists now say.\par \par \uc2 Many U.S. factories that moved to Mexico did so to match prices from China. Some of the new Mexican factories helped support U.S. jobs. For example, fabrics made in the U.S. are turned into clothing in Mexico for sale globally by U.S. companies.\par \par \uc2 David Autor, a Massachusetts Institute of Technology economist who has studied trade, labor markets and technological change, calls China's economy a "500-ton boulder perched on a ledge." At some point, it would tumble and splatter what was below, but "you just didn't know when," he says.\par \par \uc2 Economists have long argued that while free trade creates winners and losers, the net results are beneficial. Americans gained from inexpensive imports and filled their homes with low-price bicycles, jewelry and kitchenware. U.S. companies won access to overseas markets.\par \par \uc2 Workers in industries exposed to imports were expected to upgrade their job skills or move somewhere offering fresh opportunities.\par \par \uc2 Japan's invasion in the 1970s largely hit industries in cities with broad manufacturing bases on which to fall back. In Akron, Ohio, long the center of the U.S. tire industry, chemists trained at the \uc2 University of Akron\uc2  helped create a local polymer industry that employs tens of thousands of workers, said David Lieberth, a former Akron deputy mayor who chronicles the city's history.\par \par \uc2 China upended many of those assumptions. No other country came close to its combination of a vast working-age population, super-low wages, government support, cheap currency and productivity gains.\par \par \uc2 Imports from China as a percentage of U.S. economic output doubled within four years of China joining theWorld Trade Organization in 2001. Mexico took 12 years to do the same thing after Nafta. Japan took just as long after becoming a major U.S. supplier in 1974.\par \par \uc2 By last year, imports from China equaled 2.7% of U.S. gross domestic product, a percentage point larger than Japan or Mexico ever won.\par \par \uc2 Japan's import wave also challenged a limited group of advanced manufacturing industries, largely autos, steel and consumer electronics. China's low-cost imports swept the entire U.S., squeezing producers of electronics in San Jose, Calif., sporting goods in Orange County, Calif., jewelry in Providence, R.I., shoes in West Plains, Mo., toys in Murray, Ky., and lounge chairs in Tupelo, Miss., among many other industries and communities.\par \par \uc2 "If we encouraged China to trade, we needed domestic policies in place that would minimize the impact that would follow," says Gordon Hanson, a University of California, San Diego economics professor. He calls the lack of such policies "a catastrophic mistake."\par \par \uc2 A group of economists that includes Messrs. Hanson and Autor estimates that Chinese competition was responsible for 2.4 million jobs lost in the U.S. between 1999 and 2011. Total U.S. employment rose 2.1 million to 132.9 million in the same period.\par \par \uc2 In the 2000s, congressional districts where competition from Chinese imports was rapidly increasing became more politically polarized, the two researchers and two coauthors concluded from examining vote totals. "Ideologically strident" candidates replaced moderates, they wrote in a paper.\par \par \uc2 In this year's Republican presidential primary races,Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  won 89 of the 100 counties most affected by competition from China, according to an analysis by The Wall Street Journal. Those counties include Hickory's Catawba County, where Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  got 44% of the Republican vote in the March primary against 11 other candidates.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Sanders won Democratic primaries in 64 of the 100 most-exposed counties in northern and Midwestern states. That pattern didn't hold in the South, where Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  was strong among black voters.\par \par \uc2 Hickory, a quiet city of about 40,000 people, used to have a smell redolent of wood lacquer. It was a boomtown in the late 1990s. Foreign competition challenged the local apparel industry, but furniture thrived.\par \par \uc2 Furniture makers figured they were relatively safe from imports because their products were bulky, expensive to ship and often involved hand-craftsmanship. Then shipping costs fell, and many Americans chose low prices above all else.\par \par \uc2 Manufacturing employment in Catawba County and surrounding areas shrank to 38,000 in 2014 from 79,000 in 2000. Nearly half the decline was caused by lost furniture jobs.\par \par \uc2 Last year, total U.S. imports of furniture and fixtures from China reached $20.4 billion, up from $4.4 billion in 2000, the Census Bureau estimates. Especially hard hit were communities in North Carolina, Virginia, Tennessee, Iowa and Wisconsin.\par \par \uc2 The U.S. now imports 73.5% of all furniture it consumes, according to \uc2 Jerry Epperson\uc2 , an analyst at investment bank Mann, Armistead & Epperson Ltd. in Richmond, Va. More than half of that percentage comes from China.\par \par \uc2 "We were all pretty surprised by the speed," says Alex Bernhardt Jr., chief executive of \uc2 Bernhardt Furniture Co\uc2 ., a family-owned manufacturer based in Lenoir, N.C., about 17 miles from Hickory.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Bernhardt and other furniture makers say they inadvertently helped China by dispatching technicians to its factories to offer guidance. American furniture companies also sent tools, parts and instructions to China to build intricate, machine-made products there.\par \par \uc2 Alex Shuford\uc2 , 42, the CEO of family-owned RHF Inc., which owns \uc2 Century Furniture\uc2  and is based in Hickory, says the help U.S. manufacturers gave China "was like \uc2 Ford\uc2  helping Toyota."\par \par \uc2 Century and Bernhardt survived by focusing their U.S. production on made-to-order goods, especially upholstered furniture. Bernhardt now has 1,600 employees in North Carolina, down from 2,800 in 2000, while Century has shrunk to 845 workers in the state from 1,323 in 2003.\par \par \uc2 U.S. policies to deal with Chinese trade failed, including efforts to collect import duties. In 2004, a coalition of furniture makers won a trade case against China and collected $309 million in tariffs.\par \par \uc2 Stanley Furniture Co\uc2 ., of High Point, N.C., received the biggest payout, which totaled $83.5 million, but had just 71 workers left in the U.S. as of last year, compared with 2,600 a decade earlier. Stanley spent heavily on a U.S.-made line of children's furniture, but it flopped.\par \par \uc2 "We invested millions in the effort to save jobs," says Stanley President and Chief Executive Glenn Prillaman.\par \par \uc2 Stuart Shoun, the Hickory machinist, says he was a 20-year-old "hillbilly" in search of steady work when he moved to Hickory from Mountain City, Tenn., in 1977. Roads to jobs in Hickory were called the Hillbilly Highway.\par \par \uc2 When layoffs hit, Mr. Shoun was surprised some coworkers asked for help deciphering instructions because they couldn't read or write. "How would they even go and fill out [job] applications?" he recalls thinking.\par \par \uc2 He was recruited to run a furniture plant in China and could have doubled his salary to about $100,000."The offer said to me: 'You might want to get out of North Carolina and go to China because that's where the industry is going,'" he says. He didn't want to leave his family and turned down the job.\par \par \uc2 During earlier import surges, American cities and workers remade themselves. Detroit rebounded from Japanese competition in the 1980s, with auto maker \uc2 Chrysler\uc2  and leader Lee Iacocca emerging as symbols of American revival. \uc2 Chrysler\uc2  is now part of \uc2 Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Laid-off workers adjusted more slowly to the China shock. In Hickory and across the U.S., fewer uprooted themselves in search of job opportunities elsewhere, migration data show. Economists cite the increase in two-income families, the aging population, housing bust and skyrocketing housing costs in places such as San Francisco and Austin, Texas.\par \par \uc2 Government efforts for laid-off workers haven't helped much. Washington's formal program to retrain workers hurt by import competition, called Trade Adjustment Assistance, pays for two years of college tuition and extends unemployment-insurance payouts.\par \par \uc2 A 2012 evaluation ordered by the Labor Department found that program participants, especially those older than 50, generally made less money four years after starting the program than those who didn't sign up. The others went back to work more quickly.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Shuford, Century's CEO, calls the job-relief program a "Band-Aid for an economy that has a sliced artery."\par \par \uc2 In Hickory, laid-off workers went to community collegebut often came away without jobs in other industries. After losing his job in 2006, Mr. Shoun figured that learning architectural design would help him get a better job. The housing market collapsed by the time he finished his training in 2008. He went back to the furniture business.\par \par \uc2 His ex-wife, Michelle Surratt,an eighth-grade dropoutwho lost her job in 2006, used Trade Adjustment Assistance to start earning a high-school diploma but never took the required math test because she was "scared about numbers," she says.\par \par \uc2 Ms. Surratt, 58, earns $9.69 an hour repairing furniture fabric. About 15 years ago, she made about $1 an hour more as a machine operator.\par \par \uc2 Many workers figure they aren't cut out for college and turn to Social Security Disability after years of grinding factory work. Between 2000 and 2013, the number of Catawba County residents on disability rose 86%, compared with increases of 61% in North Carolina and 65% in the U.S.\par \par \uc2 Anthony "Tony" Crawford, an upholsterer, tore a knee and hurt his back tripping over wooden frames on a furniture-factory floor in 2009. During the boom, he made $29 an hour and worked overtime shifts for more money.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Crawford, 45, now lives on a fraction of his old income. "I made my money with my hands," he says. "Back to school wasn't an option."\par \par \uc2 In recent years, Hickory has shown signs of revival. The jobless rate was 5% in June, slightly higher than the U.S. Much of the improvement in Hickory's unemployment rate is due to the area's labor force shrinking by about 25,000 jobs, or 13%, since 2001. That means there are fewer people to count as unemployed.\par \par \uc2 Apple Inc\uc2 ., \uc2 Alphabet Inc\uc2 .'s \uc2 Google\uc2  and \uc2 Facebook Inc\uc2 . have set up data centers, some on a stretch of U.S. 321 long called Furniture Row. Those operations don't employ many people. \uc2 Bed, Bath & Beyond\uc2  Inc.'s 48,000-square-foot data center has seven workers, according to county officials.\par \par \uc2 Bernhardt, facing a shortage of skilled labor, now advertises for upholsterers at movie theaters and offers signing bonuses of $1,000.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Autor, the MIT economist, says the worst is probably over now that wages in China are rising and production has begun shifting to lower-cost countries including Vietnam. That makes little difference to Hickory's furniture-industry casualties, few of whom are likely to regain the economic ground they lost.\par \par \uc2 "What we heard was China, China, China," says Lonnie Joiner, Mr. Shoun's former boss. "I blamed the large corporations and their greed."\par \par \uc2 Mr. Joiner says he supports Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , who won him over with "raw honesty and brashness" and his tough talk on trade.\par \par \uc2 (See related letter: "Letters to the Editor: The Problem Isn't China; It's U.S. Multinationals" -- WSJ August 18, 2016)\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=wjco20160812000078"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document J000000020160812ec8c00023\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw272\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4080\pichgoal600

\par\par \b \uc2 U.S. News: Economists Cite Vote Drag\b0\par\par\uc2 By Josh Zumbrun   \par \uc2 475 \uc2 words\par \uc2 12 August 2016\par \uc2 The Wall Street Journal\par \uc2 J\par A2\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 For the first time in this \uc2 election\uc2  cycle, most economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal believe uncertainty from the coming vote is crimping economic activity.\par \par \uc2 A majority -- 57% -- of participants in the Journal's latest survey said the economy has suffered, at least somewhat. "This \uc2 election\uc2  introduces a Mount Everest of uncertainty," said Kevin Swift, chief economist at the \uc2 American Chemistry Council\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Economists have long believed that uncertainty has the potential to restrain consumer spending and business investment if people and businesses have significant questions about the taxes and regulations they will face.\par \par \uc2 Until this month's survey, however, the majority of economists thought even an \uc2 election\uc2  like this year's didn't rise to the level of posing a macroeconomic problem.\par \par \uc2 Views shifted after a report last month from the Commerce Department showed that business investment through June declined for the third consecutive quarter.\par \par \uc2 "Investment spending clearly shows the detrimental impact of the \uc2 election\uc2 ," said Sean Snaith, director of the Institute for Economic Competitiveness at the University of Central Florida.\par \par \uc2 Initially, many had attributed the decline to possible fallout from lower oil prices, which had crimped investment among U.S. oil producers. But during her June press conference, Federal Reserve Chairwoman \uc2 Janet Yellen\uc2  noted the decline in investment was broader than could be explained by energy.\par \par \uc2 "Business investment outside of energy was particularly weak during the winter and appears to have remained so into the spring," she said.\par \par \uc2 Data since then have confirmed that investment weakness had, indeed, continued.\par \par \uc2 The Journal surveyed 62 business, financial and academic economists from Aug. 5 to Aug. 9, though not every economist answered every question.\par \par \uc2 The respondents trimmed forecasts for 2016 economic growth. The panel now expects 2016 growth of 1.8%, down from an estimate of 2% last month and 2.5% at the beginning of the year. Their forecasts for the unemployment rate were little changed.\par \par \uc2 While 1.8% growth would be another disappointment, it shows most economists think the uncertainty will crimp but not cripple the U.S. The average estimate for the odds of the U.S. entering a recession over the next year was 21%, compared with 22% last month. Still, the figure was double the estimate from a year ago.\par \par \uc2 At the heart of businesses' uncertainty is the question of what government policy changes might occur. "Never have the options for policy been less well understood in an \uc2 election\uc2  cycle," said Amy Crews Cutts, chief economist for the credit-rating firm Equifax.\par \par \uc2 On trade, both Democratic presidential nominee \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  and Republican rival \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  have opposed the 12-nation Pacific trade deal that the current administration negotiated, and both have expressed doubts about the two-decade-old \uc2 North American Free Trade Agreement\uc2 .\par \par {\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw380\pich397\picscaley75\picscalex75\picwgoal7600\pichgoal7940

\par\par \uc2 National Desk; SECTA\par \b \uc2 Clinton\uc2  Campaign Eyes Puerto Ricans in Florida\b0\par\par\uc2 By MATT FLEGENHEIMER and AMY CHOZICK; Matt Flegenheimer reported from Kissimmee, and Amy Chozick from New York. \par \uc2 1,340 \uc2 words\par \uc2 12 August 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 16\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 KISSIMMEE, Fla. -- Bilingual campaign workers fanned out across the event hall, clutching clipboards as they sought prospective voters to register. Handmade signs shot up from the crowd: ''Latinos for Hillary'' and ''Estoy con ella!''\par \par \uc2 And from the stage at her rally here on Monday night, \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  set aside time for ''a special word about Puerto Rico.''\par \par \uc2 ''If you live in Puerto Rico, you can't vote for your president and commander in chief, right?'' she reminded thousands of supporters, noting that she had worked closely with Puerto Ricans as a senator from New York. ''But as an American citizen, if you move to Florida or New York, you can vote for the president and commander in chief.''\par \par \uc2 Indeed.\par \par \uc2 Amid the commonwealth's devastating debt crisis, Puerto Ricans have moved in droves to the American mainland, with as many as 1,000 families a month relocating to Florida, according to the Puerto Rico Federal Affairs Administration.\par \par \uc2 In that exodus, \uc2 Clinton\uc2  campaign organizers have recognized an opportunity, setting off a furious scramble to register a coveted class of new voters: those who arrive as full-fledged citizens.\par \par \uc2 Many are settling in Central Florida, a swing region in a swing state with a peerless record of razor-thin electoral margins.\par \par \uc2 Campaign officials and outside groups have responded accordingly.\par \par \uc2 In the Orlando area -- which for years has been a de facto San Juan suburb, with an estimated 400,000 Puerto Ricans calling it home -- the \uc2 Clinton\uc2  campaign has assigned organizers to neighborhoods, churches and even bus stops. ''Caravanas'' of cars blasting reggaeton music and reminders to vote call to mind similar processions through San Juan's cobblestone streets during elections on the island. When neighbors come outside to investigate the fuss, they are offered brochures about the candidate, known to many Latinos simply as ''La Hillary,'' and about her plans for education and health care.\par \par \uc2 Democrats are not operating unchallenged. While \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's campaign has left little organizational footprint, other Republican-aligned operatives have stepped in.\par \par \uc2 Though they are sitting out the presidential campaign, Charles G. and \uc2 David H. Koch\uc2 , billionaire Republican donors, are financing the Libre Initiative, which works to educate Latinos about conservative positions. Libre has nearly 30 employees in Florida and has begun appearing regularly with booths at expos held in Florida and in Puerto Rico for new arrivals and those leaving the island -- offering would-be migrants help finding jobs or registering their children for school, and hoping to establish them, in the long term, as conservatives.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's dismal standing with Latino voters has complicated the task. An ABC News/Washington Post poll in mid-June found that 89 percent of Hispanics held negative views of him. And this week, the chief spokesman for the Florida Republican Party, Wadi Gaitan -- the son of Honduran immigrants -- left his post to join Libre, citing Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  as his reason.\par \par \uc2 ''Moving on gives me a great, new opportunity to continue promoting free-market solutions while avoiding efforts that support \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2 ,'' Mr. Gaitan said in a statement.\par \par \uc2 Republicans could once rely on solidly conservative Cuban-American political refugees in Miami as a crucial source of support. But it is not so simple anymore: Young Cuban arrivals are less reliably Republican; South Americans now make up a growing segment of the Latino population in the state; and Puerto Ricans, who at more than a million statewide now rival the Cuban-American population, are flocking to Orange, Osceola and Polk Counties in Central Florida -- once the heart of the state's white working-class vote.\par \par \uc2 Those demographic changes have already had consequences: George W. Bush lost to \uc2 John Kerry\uc2  in Orange County by fewer than 1,000 votes in 2004, but in 2008 and again in 2012, President Obama won there by about 85,000.\par \par \uc2 Still, while Puerto Ricans generally favor Democrats, they have tended to be less party-conscious than some other groups, bolstering Mr. Obama in his two Florida victories but also helping to elect Charlie Crist as governor when he was a Republican.\par \par \uc2 And in contrast to Cuban-Americans, who have long wielded power in Florida, newly arrived Puerto Rican voters often need to be reminded they can even vote.\par \par \uc2 ''Their political participation on the island is so high,'' said Lorella Praeli, the Peruvian-born Latino vote director for the \uc2 Clinton\uc2  campaign. ''Now that they're in Florida, it's about voter education, reminding them they can participate.''\par \par \uc2 Some have not required prodding.\par \par \uc2 Fernando Ruiz, 39, said that registering to vote was among his first priorities after fleeing Toa Alta, P.R., last year amid the island's debt crisis.\par \par \uc2 ''There's no excuse,'' he said through an interpreter when asked why it was important to vote. ''I came to the United States to progress.''\par \par \uc2 After finding work at a pizza restaurant, Mr. Ruiz said, he was quickly promoted to food preparer from dishwasher.\par \par \uc2 Esteban Garces, the Florida state director for Mi Familia Vota, a nonprofit that registers Hispanic voters, said the group expected to enroll 30,000 Latinos across five counties of Central Florida before \uc2 Election\uc2  Day. More than half, he said, were likely to be Puerto Rican.\par \par \uc2 ''It's driving a migration to this area that's not been seen before,'' Mr. Garces said of the island's financial strain.\par \par \uc2 Sergio Bendixen, a Democratic pollster in Miami, was more blunt: The crisis-related influx, he said, has been ''very good news for the Democrats.''\par \par \uc2 Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's team is intent on pressing its advantage. Her campaign has more than a dozen offices in Florida, with some aides focusing on non-Cuban Hispanics.\par \par \uc2 Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  herself has ample experience: During the 2008 Democratic primary, she wore a tropical-print shirt to campaign and participated in her own ''caravana'' in Puerto Rico, where she handily defeated Mr. Obama. She returned to the island last year to discuss health care and, again, won the June 5 primary there by double digits.\par \par \uc2 Bill \uc2 Clinton\uc2  and the campaign's political director, Amanda Renteria, have also visited Puerto Rico. And the campaign has issued bilingual messages of support for an increase in funding to fight the Zika virus and for a bipartisan bill to address the debt crisis.\par \par \uc2 More recently, the \uc2 Clinton\uc2  campaign has invested in shoe-leather outreach.\par \par \uc2 On Wednesday, a campaign team held court at the entrance of a \uc2 Walmart\uc2  in Kissimmee, contending with humidity and flies while asking just about every passer-by about his or her registration status.\par \par \uc2 A day earlier, after meeting outside a laundromat near Miami's Little Havana, in a neighborhood that includes a high concentration of both Cuban and non-Cuban Hispanics, three organizers canvassed the surrounding blocks.\par \par \uc2 ''Hola!'' said Cari Casas, 20, the field organizer for the area, as she approached a woman who was spraying a white blouse inside the laundromat.\par \par \uc2 ''S\u237\'00\'ED,'' the woman replied pre-emptively, assuring Ms. Casas that she was ready for November.\par \par \uc2 Over the course of an hour, the group registered about eight voters -- outside a \uc2 Starbucks\uc2 , in a minimall and at a bus stop, where Ms. Casas persuaded a woman to scribble the requisite information on a form just as her ride was arriving. Most people they engaged said they were already accounted for.\par \par \uc2 A few recognized Ms. Casas from past visits, offering waves and well wishes. In an interview, she suggested that Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's candidacy had assigned a particular urgency to her work, decades after her grandparents emigrated from Mexico.\par \par \uc2 ''They're not rapists or criminals,'' Ms. Casas said. ''They're janitors.''\par \par \uc2 Find out what you need to know about the 2016 presidential race today, and get politics news updates via \uc2 Facebook\uc2 , \uc2 Twitter\uc2  and the First Draft newsletter.\par \par \uc2 Anabella Rivera, 2, waited while her mother Marisela, a native of Puerto Rico, updated her voter registration in Kissimmee, Fla.

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 LANCASTER, Pa. -- As \uc2 Gov. Mike Pence\uc2  of Indiana was extolling \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2  to a crowd here on Tuesday as a ''good man'' who ''speaks from his heart,'' Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  was holding a rally just a few states south, with a decidedly different message -- suggesting that gun owners could take action against \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Moments later, stepping down from the stage, Mr. Pence found himself in a familiar position, trying to explain away Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's comments.\par \par \uc2 ''Of course not, no,'' Mr. Pence said, when asked by a local news affiliate if his running mate was calling for his supporters to take up arms against the Democratic nominee.\par \par \uc2 Less than a month after becoming the Republican nominee for vice president, \uc2 Mike Pence\uc2  -- Midwestern calm and folksy to Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's controversial and brash -- has emerged as the Republican ticket's cleaner-up in chief, a role that has thrust him deftly, if at times uncomfortably, into the spotlight in his quest to help elect Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  president.\par \par \uc2 But behind the scenes, Mr. Pence and his team of loyalists are waging an equally challenging campaign, hoping to position him as a compelling national politician for a post-2016 landscape. Even if the Republican ticket fails in the battle for the White House, Mr. Pence wants to preserve his future viability, a goal that has created a delicate dance for him -- leaving him wary of offending Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  and his base, while also eager to ingratiate himself with the Republican establishment.\par \par \uc2 So far, Mr. Pence has performed this awkward two-step quite nimbly.\par \par \uc2 During one recent week, for instance, he found himself staking out different ground from his running mate on three occasions: over Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's suggestion that Russia hack \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's emails; over Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's criticisms of a Gold Star family; and over Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's initial comments, since reversed, that he was not prepared to endorse Speaker Paul D. Ryan in his primary contest.\par \par \uc2 Yet each time, Mr. Pence managed to do so carefully, without angering the top of the ticket.\par \par \uc2 ''Mike will keep his style,'' said Frederick S. Klipsch, the chairman of Hoosiers for Quality Education and the treasurer of Mr. Pence's campaigns since 2011. ''He's a man of integrity, he's a man of high values, and he won't compromise that. I think \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  would not expect \uc2 Mike Pence\uc2  to do anything other than be himself.''\par \par \uc2 Mr. Pence and Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  were always an unlikely pairing -- an ostentatious, thrice-married Manhattanite and a mild-mannered Midwestern governor, bound together more by mutual need and ambition than actual chemistry. (Joining the Republican ticket, after all, plucked Mr. Pence out of a tough re-\uc2 election\uc2  fight that could have ended in an embarrassing defeat.)\par \par \uc2 But Mr. Pence's transition to the \uc2 Trump\uc2  ticket has largely exceeded both teams' hopes -- not unlike an arranged marriage that has flourished beyond either family's expectations.\par \par \uc2 On the campaign trail, Mr. Pence echoes Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's general message (saying his running mate will put ''safety and security'' first), vouches for his character (calling him, at stop after stop, ''a good man'' who would make a ''great president''), and adopts a posture of benevolent amusement -- light chuckling, as if at a wayward child -- when Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  skirts near the controversial.\par \par \uc2 ''He has been so great,'' Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  said, at a recent news conference. ''Honestly, he's been even better than I thought, O.K.? Better.''\par \par \uc2 Mr. Pence's strengths, aides said, are his discipline in staying on message; his fund-raising prowess; and his ability to connect with the party's conservative and religious base.\par \par \uc2 He views himself as a loyal soldier, eager to tell the Republican nominee's story to voters, though Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  has also encouraged him to talk about his record as governor of Indiana. The two men talk by phone daily when they are not together, and Mr. Pence has taken to calling Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  ''my new boss'' on the trail.\par \par \uc2 The Indiana governor is also reaching out to prominent Republicans, like Senator \uc2 John McCain\uc2  of Arizona and Charlie Sykes, the Wisconsin radio host who is vehemently opposed to Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , holding private meetings when he passes through their states.\par \par \uc2 And his team has quietly reinstated the credentials of news media like \uc2 Politico\uc2  and The \uc2 Washington Post\uc2 , which Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  has barred from his own events.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Pence has better favorability ratings than Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , according to a new \uc2 Monmouth University\uc2  poll, with 33 percent of likely voters viewing him favorably, compared with 26 percent for Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 People close to Mr. Pence's expanding circle, however, said that some in his orbit were taken aback by what they saw from Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  and his campaign during the initial rollout, especially the scattershot \uc2 Trump\uc2  operation and the lack of planning. They have also worried that Mr. Pence may be sullied by the controversies of his running mate.\par \par \uc2 Still, Mr. Pence has largely been given control over his own message, though his team still runs most everything by the \uc2 Trump\uc2  operation. And Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  has seemed unbothered when Mr. Pence has diverged slightly from him on the campaign trail.\par \par \uc2 Nonetheless, there seems to be an unspoken rule that the No. 2 will show proper deference to the top of the ticket.\par \par \uc2 After Mr. Pence decided to publicly endorse Mr. Ryan despite Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's early misgivings, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  made sure to tell a crowd in Maine that Mr. Pence had explicitly sought his permission.\par \par \uc2 ''He said: 'Would you mind if I endorsed? I won't do that if that could cause any complication or problems. I would absolutely not do that,''' Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  said, recounting a phone conversation he had had with Mr. Pence, before telling him, ''Go ahead and do it, 100 percent.''\par \par \uc2 Mr. Pence self-deprecatingly kids that he is ''kind of a B-list Republican celebrity,'' and teasingly contrasts himself with the G.O.P. nominee.\par \par \uc2 ''We're a little bit different, not only in our style, but also -- O.K., our balance sheet, just a little difference,'' he said, smiling, in Grand Rapids, Mich.\par \par \uc2 Later, he talked about how ''cool'' it was to fly on Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's plane, before adding that Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  ''actually got me an airplane to fly around.''\par \par \uc2 ''It's a pretty big airplane,'' he said, pausing for effect, ''except when it's parked next to his.''\par \par \uc2 The pair's body language, too, has converged.\par \par \uc2 When Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  first introduced Mr. Pence to the nation, he took to pointing at him with his forefinger, as if to say, ''How about this guy?''\par \par \uc2 Just days later, Mr. Pence seemed to mimic his boss, almost inadvertently.\par \par \uc2 At a rally in Roanoke, Va., recently, Mr. Pence tried a tentative, Trumpesque finger point at Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  himself as the two men shook hands and turned forward to pose for the cameras.\par \par \uc2 And later, at Mr. Pence's first solo postconvention rally, in Waukesha, Wis., some of Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's confident flair seemed to have rubbed off on him. There, an emboldened Mr. Pence turned to the state's governor, Scott Walker, and offered an ebullient, \uc2 Trump\uc2 -like finger point.\par \par \uc2 Find out what you need to know about the 2016 presidential race today, and get politics news updates via \uc2 Facebook\uc2 , \uc2 Twitter\uc2  and the First Draft newsletter.\par \par \uc2 Gov.

\par\par \uc2 LETTER FROM AMERICA\par \uc2 National Desk; SECT\par \b \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  and the Evolution of American Politics\b0\par\par\uc2 By JOHN HARWOOD \par \uc2 780 \uc2 words\par \uc2 12 August 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 The New York Times on the Web\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 The first female vice-presidential nominee got a full helping of gender stereotype. ''Let me help you with the difference,'' George H. W. Bush told the nominee, Geraldine Ferraro, in their 1984 debate, ''between Iran and the embassy in Lebanon.''\par \par \uc2 The first female presidential nominee faces no danger from such an attack. \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  holds clear advantages over \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  when it comes to what voters once considered masculine strengths they sought in a leader.\par \par \uc2 That flows logically from the background of the candidates. Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  has developed real estate and starred in reality television; Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  served as first lady, senator and secretary of state, where she carved out a reputation for a relatively aggressive approach to foreign policy, including in Afghanistan, Iraq and Syria.\par \par \uc2 Yet while gender bias remains a real issue on many fronts, Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's standing reflects the evolution of assumptions about gender roles ever since the feminist movement gathered force in the 1960s.\par \par \uc2 ''We've seen a half-century of evolution in attitudes,'' said Ruth Mandel, director of the Eagleton Institute of Politics at \uc2 Rutgers University\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 American voters once compared male and female candidates through the lens of characteristics they assumed to be inherent. They generally granted women the presumption of greater honesty and empathy; they presumed men, in politics as in business, possessed superior strength and competence.\par \par \uc2 Those beliefs loomed especially large over the \uc2 election\uc2  of the United States' commander in chief. The first female president was widely expected to be a Republican, on the theory that the party's reputation for national security prowess could offset a female nominee's political vulnerabilities.\par \par \uc2 That calculus has changed. Although it's a long way from parity, female candidates have become much more common: The 43 women nominated by the two major parties for congressional races in 1974 grew to 121 by 1994, and 174 by 2014. An electorate polarized by party now judges candidates by their affiliation more than anything else.\par \par \uc2 ''Gender stereotypes have gone away almost entirely,'' said Jennifer Lawless, an American University political scientist, who compared views of male and female congressional candidates for a recent book, ''Women on the Run.''\par \par \uc2 Americans have grown accustomed to observing female leaders elsewhere, including Margaret Thatcher and \uc2 Theresa May\uc2  in Britain, and \uc2 Angela Merkel\uc2  in Germany. At home, the Democratic pollster \uc2 Peter Hart\uc2  said, the rise of some women to the top of major corporations smoothed a path for voters to envision a woman in the Oval Office.\par \par \uc2 ''There is much greater acceptance of women being able to be seen in that commander-in-chief role,'' Mr. Hart said. He advised the 1984 presidential campaign of Walter Mondale, who picked Mrs. Ferraro as his running mate.\par \par \uc2 Mrs. Ferraro, then in her sixth year in the House of Representatives, didn't shrink from the ''let me help you'' barb in her debate. ''I almost resent, Vice President Bush, your patronizing attitude that you have to teach me about foreign policy,'' she shot back.\par \par \uc2 Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  need not fear that line of argument. In the poll Mr. Hart helps conduct for NBC News and The Wall Street Journal, voters last month preferred her over Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  by 26 percentage points on conducting foreign policy, 18 points on handling a crisis, and 11 points on serving as commander in chief.\par \par \uc2 Nor does Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , whose truthfulness was called into question most recently over her use of a private email server while she was secretary of state, benefit from any presumption of honesty. Just 22 percent of voters in the NBC-Wall Street Journal poll rated her highly as ''honest and straightforward,'' the sort of finding that Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  has worked to exploit by frequently referring to her as ''Crooked Hillary.''\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  has also sought to attack Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  by suggesting that the success of her campaign is rooted almost entirely in her gender.\par \par \uc2 ''If \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  were a man, I don't think she'd get 5 percent of the vote,'' he said last spring. ''The only thing she's got going is the women's card.''\par \par \uc2 Stereotypes about women haven't vanished. Wielded with subtlety, Ms. Lawless said, they can still benefit male politicians among some older and less-partisan voters.\par \par \uc2 But Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  alienates younger and better-educated voters more ''by being so overt in his rhetoric,'' she added.

\par\par \uc2 OP-ED COLUMNIST\par \uc2 Editorial Desk; SECTA\par \b \uc2 Pieces of Silver\b0\par\par\uc2 By PAUL KRUGMAN \par \uc2 903 \uc2 words\par \uc2 12 August 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 23\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 By now, it's obvious to everyone with open eyes that \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  is an ignorant, wildly dishonest, erratic, immature, bullying egomaniac. On the other hand, he's a terrible person. But despite some high-profile defections, most senior figures in the Republican Party -- very much including \uc2 Paul Ryan\uc2 , the speaker of the House, and Mitch McConnell, the Senate majority leader -- are still supporting him, threats of violence and all. Why?\par \par \uc2 One answer is that these were never men and women of principle. I know that many in the news media are still determined to portray Mr. Ryan, in particular, as an honest man serious about policy, but his actual policy proposals have always been transparent con jobs.\par \par \uc2 Another answer is that in an era of intense partisanship, the greatest risk facing many Republican politicians isn't that of losing in the general \uc2 election\uc2 , it's that of losing to an extremist primary challenger. This makes them afraid to cross Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , whose ugliness channels the true feelings of the party's base.\par \par \uc2 But there's a third answer, which can be summarized in one number: 34.\par \par \uc2 What's that? It's the \uc2 Congressional Budget Office\uc2 's estimate of the average federal tax rate for the top 1 percent in 2013, the latest year available. And it's up from just 28.2 in 2008, because President Obama allowed the high-end Bush tax cuts to expire and imposed new taxes to pay for a dramatic expansion of health coverage under the Affordable Care Act. Taxes on the really, really rich have gone up even more.\par \par \uc2 If \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  wins, taxes on the elite will at minimum stay at this level, and may even go up significantly if Democrats do well enough in congressional races to enable her to pass new legislation. The nonpartisan \uc2 Tax Policy Center\uc2  estimates that her tax plan would raise the average tax rate for the top 1 percent by another 3.4 percentage points, and the rate for the top 0.1 percent by five points.\par \par \uc2 But if ''populist'' \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  wins, taxes on the wealthy will go way down; in particular, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  is calling for elimination of the inheritance tax, which these days hits only a tiny number of really yuuuge estates (a married couple doesn't pay any tax unless its estate is worth more than $10.9 million).\par \par \uc2 So if you're wealthy, or you're someone who has built a career by reliably serving the interests of the wealthy, the choice is clear -- as long as you don't care too much about stuff like shunning racism, preserving democracy and freedom of religion, or for that matter avoiding nuclear war, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  is your guy.\par \par \uc2 And that's pretty much how the Republican establishment still sees it. Getting rid of the estate tax is ''the linchpin of the conservative movement,'' one major donor told Bloomberg's Sahil Kapur. Gotta get those priorities straight.\par \par \uc2 Should we be shocked at the willingness of leading Republicans to make this bargain? Well, we should be shocked -- we should never, ever start accepting this sort of thing as normal politics. But we shouldn't be surprised, because it's just an extension of the devil's bargain the economic right has been making for decades, going all the way back to Nixon's ''Southern strategy.''\par \par \uc2 Don't take my word for it; listen to the conservatives who have reached their limit. Recently Avik Roy, a leading Republican health-policy expert, had the personal and moral courage to admit what liberals (and political scientists) have been saying for years: ''In reality, the gravitational center of the Republican Party is white nationalism.''\par \par \uc2 Just to be clear, I'm not saying that top Republicans were or are personally bigoted -- but that doesn't matter. What does matter is that they were willing to curry favor with bigots in the service of tax cuts for the rich and financial deregulation. Remember, \uc2 Mitt Romney\uc2  eagerly accepted a \uc2 Trump\uc2  endorsement in 2012, knowing full well that he was welcoming a racist conspiracy theorist into his camp.\par \par \uc2 All that has happened this year is a move of those white nationalists from part of the supporting cast to a starring role. So when Republicans who went along with the earlier strategy draw the line at Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , they're not really taking a stand on principle; they're just complaining about the price. And the party's top leadership isn't even willing to do that.\par \par \uc2 If this \uc2 election\uc2  goes the way it probably will, a few months from now those leading Republicans will be trying to pretend that they never really supported their party's nominee, that in their hearts they always knew he was the wrong man.\par \par \uc2 But whatever doubts they may be feeling don't excuse their actions, and in fact make them even less forgivable. For the fact is that right now, when it matters, they have decided that lower tax rates on the rich are sufficient payment for betraying American ideals and putting the republic as we know it in danger.\par \par \uc2 Read my blog, The Conscience of a Liberal, and follow me on Twitter, @PaulKrugman.\par \par \uc2 Follow The \uc2 New York Times\uc2  Opinion section on \uc2 Facebook\uc2  and Twitter (@NYTopinion), and sign up for the Opinion Today newsletter.\par \par \uc2 David Brooks is off today.\par \par \uc2 Document NYTF000020160812ec8c0005l\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2 's rallies once drew their share of benign conservatives, offbeat libertarians and plain curiosity seekers. But as time and Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's act have worn on, many of them have no doubt gone the way of his poll numbers. Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's crowds remain big and loud, but they're angrier and more malevolent, and so is Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 At a rally on Wednesday near Fort Lauderdale, Fla., criticizing President Obama's and \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's records against the Islamic State, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  said:\par \par \uc2 ''In many respects you know they honor President Obama. ISIS is honoring President Obama! He is the founder of ISIS. He's the founder of ISIS, O.K.! He's the founder, he founded ISIS and I would say the co-founder would be crooked \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 . Co-founder, crooked \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 . And that's what it's about.'' As the crowd erupted into cheers and chants of ''Lock her up,'' Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  then smiled and basked in the crowd's applause.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  repeated the false charge on Thursday, saying he'd continue his inflammatory campaign, even if it meant losing in November.\par \par \uc2 A vast majority of Americans, of course, understand that Mr. Obama did not create ISIS, nor does the group, which targets Western nations, ''honor'' him or any other American leader. Some may even recall an ISIS beheading video released last year in which a masked jihadist stood before a bound, kneeling Kurdish soldier and declared: ''Know, oh Obama, that we will reach America. Know also that we will cut off your head in the White House and transform America into a Muslim province.''\par \par \uc2 If Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  knows this, he doesn't care. By referring to the president by his full name, \uc2 Barack Hussein Obama\uc2 , he continues to wink at some of his staunchest supporters: conspiracy theorists obsessed with the false claim that Mr. Obama is a secret Muslim. The trolls and websites that advance racist theories have supplied Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  with talking points for years. He consulted with one of them in 2011, when he launched his ''birther'' campaign, falsely claiming that Mr. Obama was born outside the United States.\par \par \uc2 Sure enough, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's \uc2 Twitter\uc2  legions took up the call. Tweeted one: ''\uc2 Barack Hussein Obama\uc2  is the Founder of ISIS! America's Islamist-in-Chief, America's Muslim-in-Charge. An ongoing disaster threatening World!''\par \par \uc2 One whose \uc2 Twitter\uc2  avatar is the muzzle of a revolver wrote, ''So Why Can't \uc2 Barack Hussein Obama\uc2  Admit #ISIS Beheaded Christians?''\par \par \uc2 Another posted a faked photo of Mr. Obama in the Oval Office, with the black flag of ISIS behind him, dressed in what appears to be Islamic clerical garb, with the message, ''Founder of ISIS: \uc2 Barack Hussein Obama\uc2  has directly and indirectly financed and armed ISIS.''\par \par \uc2 When Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  fans racist rage against the president, suggests that gun owners take up arms against Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , or speaks darkly of a ''rigged'' \uc2 election\uc2 , he is not trying to woo Republican skeptics, independents or undecided voters. He is appealing to the mob.\par \par \uc2 Right now Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  is losing, and this very likely terrifies him. Maybe he doesn't know how to control himself, or comprehend why he should. Or he is simply satisfying his boundless need for attention. But his behavior this week raises a more disturbing scenario. Perhaps he has given up on winning through civil means and does not care about the consequences of his campaign of incitement.\par \par \uc2 Follow The \uc2 New York Times\uc2  Opinion section on \uc2 Facebook\uc2  and \uc2 Twitter\uc2  (@NYTopinion), and sign up for the Opinion Today newsletter.\par \par \uc2 Document NYTF000020160812ec8c0004x\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Facing one of the toughest stretches of his presidential campaign, \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2  on Thursday acknowledged in unusually candid terms that he faced daunting hurdles in crucial states, as he swung wildly at \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  to try to blunt her questions about his fitness to serve in the Oval Office.\par \par \uc2 Sliding in the polls, and under attack even by prominent figures in his own party, the usually self-assured Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  seemed to break character, lamenting his predicament, and even asking for help, before a group of 700 evangelical pastors and church leaders in Orlando, Fla.\par \par \uc2 ''We're having a tremendous problem in Utah,'' Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  said, alluding to polls showing him in a fight with Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  in that normally deep-red state. ''Utah is different.''\par \par \uc2 In Ohio, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  said, ''We need help.''\par \par \uc2 In Pennsylvania, a state he once insisted he would win, he seemed now to hold out hope of an upset that was looking more like a long-shot. ''Pennsylvania is a little further, but I think we'll win Pennsylvania because of the miners,'' he said, adding of Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 : ''She wants the miners out of business. She wants steel out of business.''\par \par \uc2 And in Virginia, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  said, the result would depend on whether evangelical Christian voters turn out to support him in November. In 2012, he said, evangelicals nationally did not vote in sufficiently large numbers for \uc2 Mitt Romney\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 ''Had you voted for Romney, it would have been much closer,'' he told his audience. ''You didn't vote for Romney, the evangelicals. Religion didn't get out and vote.''\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  pleaded with pastors and church leaders to organize their congregants and impress upon them the stakes in the \uc2 election\uc2 . ''We're going to hopefully win, and the way we're going to win is you have to get your congregations and you have to get parishioners and you have to get all your people to go out and vote,'' he said.\par \par \uc2 In the same speech, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  repeated a hyperbolic claim that he made about Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  on Wednesday and all day Thursday: that she should be seen as aligning herself with enemies of the United States.\par \par \uc2 As his detractors have described a \uc2 Trump\uc2  presidency as a grave threat to the United States, citing his statements calling into question longstanding national security policies and alliances and even his commitment to the Constitution, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  is now trying to outdo those accusations with his own warnings about the danger Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  would present.\par \par \uc2 Where Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  and many Democrats have accused Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  of parroting President \uc2 Vladimir V. Putin\uc2  of Russia, for example, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  is calling Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  a ''founder'' of the Islamic State.\par \par \uc2 Instead of saying that her policies as secretary of state helped contribute to the group's rise -- a claim many Republicans have made -- Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  said she should be named the Islamic State's ''most valuable player'' for having done so.\par \par \uc2 At the same time, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  is accusing Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , without evidence, of intending to abolish the Second Amendment -- something that she denies and would be constitutionally unable to do as president.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  suggested that turnabout was fair play, mocking Democrats for crying foul for his remarks about Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  and the Islamic State.\par \par \uc2 ''They said it about me, it'd be fine,'' he said in Orlando. ''If I say something about them, it's terrible.''\par \par \uc2 Still, these exaggerated claims have drawn attention away from issues that Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's campaign could reasonably hope to gain traction against Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 : He has made only fleeting reference to recently released State Department emails revealing efforts to obtain a meeting for a political supporter, a subject the \uc2 Clinton\uc2  campaign has sought to avoid.\par \par \uc2 The speech to pastors was not the only instance in which Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  sounded less than cocksure: In an interview with CNBC, he acknowledged the possibility that he could lose, but insisted that he would stick with his unorthodox campaign style.\par \par \uc2 ''At the end, it's either going to work or I'm going to, you know, I'm going to have a very, very nice long vacation,'' said Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , who has rarely before conceded the possibility of defeat.\par \par \uc2 The ratcheted-up attacks on Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  -- and on President Obama, who was also accused by Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  of being a ''founder of ISIS'' at a rally in Sunrise, Fla., on Wednesday night -- came after Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's advisers suggested that he had achieved a new level of discipline in delivering a fairly comprehensive economic address on Monday in Detroit.\par \par \uc2 Then on Tuesday, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  warned a crowd in North Carolina that it would be ''a horrible day'' if Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  were elected and picked a tiebreaking justice for the Supreme Court.\par \par \uc2 ''If she gets to pick her judges, nothing you can do, folks,'' Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  said, adding: ''Although the Second Amendment people -- maybe there is, I don't know.''\par \par \uc2 The remark set off a wave of criticism from Democrats and others who said Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  had been suggesting violence against Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  or the judges she might appoint. Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  angrily denied this.\par \par \uc2 On CNBC on Thursday, when an interviewer pressed Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  on the propriety of claiming that Mr. Obama had founded the Islamic State, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  said it was ''absolutely'' the case and added: ''Is there something wrong with saying that? Are people complaining that I said he was the founder of ISIS?''\par \par \uc2 Later, in an interview with the radio host Hugh Hewitt, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  was given an opportunity to clarify, but did not budge.\par \par \uc2 ''You meant that he created the vacuum, he lost the peace,'' Mr. Hewitt suggested, leaving Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  an opening.\par \par \uc2 ''No, I meant he's the founder of ISIS. I do,'' Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  said. ''He was the most valuable player. I give him the most valuable player award. I give her, too, by the way, \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 .''\par \par \uc2 Mr. Hewitt replied, ''But he's not sympathetic to them,'' referring to President Obama. ''He hates them. He's trying to kill them.''\par \par \uc2 ''I don't care,'' Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  said. ''He was the founder. His, the way he got out of Iraq was that, that was the founding of ISIS, O.K.?''\par \par \uc2 Jake Sullivan, a senior policy adviser for Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , accused Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  of ''echoing the talking points'' of America's adversaries.\par \par \uc2 ''This is another example of \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  trash-talking the United States,'' Mr. Sullivan said in a statement. ''It goes without saying that this is a false claim from a presidential candidate with an aversion to the truth and an unprecedented lack of knowledge.''\par \par \uc2 Undeterred, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  pressed the line of attack during a speech to the \uc2 National Association of Home Builders\uc2  in Miami Beach.\par \par \uc2 ''Our government has unleashed ISIS,'' Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  said, drawing little response. ''I call President Obama and \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  the founders of ISIS. They're the founders. I think I'll give \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  most valuable player, the M.V.P. award. Her only competition is \uc2 Barack Obama\uc2 .''\par \par \uc2 Find out what you need to know about the 2016 presidential race today, and get politics news updates via \uc2 Facebook\uc2 , \uc2 Twitter\uc2  and the First Draft newsletter.\par \par \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2  in Sunrise, Fla., on Wednesday.

\par\par \uc2 Business/Financial Desk; SECT\par \b \uc2 Fact-Checking \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's Economic Speech\b0\par\par\uc2 By JACKIE CALMES \par \uc2 1,229 \uc2 words\par \uc2 12 August 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 The New York Times on the Web\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 With both major-party presidential candidates vying for working-class voters, \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  on Thursday followed \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2  to Michigan to outline her job-creation plans, answering his economic address on Monday in Detroit. Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  spoke at Futuramic Tool & Engineering Company in Macomb County, long known as a home to political ticket-splitters. Some of her statements deserved a closer look. Here are a few.\par \par \uc2 Claim: ''Even conservative experts say \uc2 Trump\uc2 's agenda will pull our economy back into recession. And according to an independent analysis by a former economic adviser to Senator \uc2 John McCain\uc2 , if you add up all of \uc2 Trump\uc2 's ideas -- from cutting taxes for the wealthy and corporations, to starting a trade war with China, to deporting millions of hardworking immigrants -- the result would be a loss of 3.4 million jobs. Now, by contrast, the same analyst found that with our plans, the economy would create more than 10 million new jobs.''\par \par \uc2 Fact Check: Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  stretched facts to ascribe such negative findings about the \uc2 Trump\uc2  agenda to ''conservative experts'' and a former McCain adviser. She referred to an analysis of the \uc2 Trump\uc2  plans in June by the economic research firm Moody's Analytics led by Mark Zandi. He did advise the McCain presidential campaign in 2008, but he also has advised Democrats, including President Obama's team, and contributed to Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's campaign last year.\par \par \uc2 Moody's\uc2  concluded that Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's plans would cost 3.5 million jobs and provoke ''a lengthy recession'' by the end of his term. That analysis does not reflect changes that Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  unveiled on Monday, which reduced the size of his tax cuts. Previously, a range of analysts estimated his tax cuts could add about $10 trillion to the federal debt over 10 years. Reducing that cost presumably could in turn reduce analysts' projections of lost jobs and economic growth. But it remains unclear, because Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  did not provide enough detail to draw conclusions.\par \par \uc2 _____\par \par \uc2 Claim: ''We will work with both parties to pass the biggest investment in new, good-paying jobs since World War II.'' To date, such investments ''have been completely blocked in Congress, and American workers in communities have paid the price.''\par \par \uc2 Fact Check: Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  was referring to her proposal for $275 billion in new infrastructure spending to build and modernize roads, bridges, airports, railways, ports, schools, water systems and more. That sum is ambitious, and indeed Mr. Obama's annual call for a similar infrastructure program has been blocked by congressional Republicans, who object to its size and to proposals to pay for it with tax increases.\par \par \uc2 But hers would not be the biggest investment since the war, allowing for inflation. That honor probably belongs to the project to build the interstate highway system, initiated during the Eisenhower administration, which cost $329 billion by the 1996 estimate of an association of automotive and highway construction industries. Adjusted for inflation 20 years later, that would be more than $500 billion.\par \par \uc2 _____\par \par \uc2 Claim: Lack of broadband access ''disadvantages kids, who are asked to do homework using the internet -- five million of them live in homes without access to the internet. So you talk about an achievement gap -- it starts right there.''\par \par \uc2 Fact Check: That indeed was the conclusion last year of an analysis of the ''homework gap'' by the \uc2 Pew Research Center\uc2 . It found that about 82.5 percent of the 29 million households with children ages 6 to 17 have broadband access. ''This means that some five million households with school-age children do not have high-speed internet service at home. Low-income households -- and especially black and Hispanic ones -- make up a disproportionate share.''\par \par \uc2 In households with incomes below $50,000 -- about 40 percent of all families -- one out of three do not have access.\par \par \uc2 _____\par \par \uc2 Claim: ''We've got to reverse what has become a kind of commonplace view, which is everybody needs to go to college. Well, in fact, more than half of the jobs that are going to be available in 2020 do not require a college four-year degree.''\par \par \uc2 Fact Check: Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  was making the point that, for many people, post-high school options that she promised to promote with government help -- like job-training programs and community college degrees -- would be sufficient to find jobs. Studies back her up. An analysis by \uc2 Georgetown University\uc2  on jobs and education requirements through 2020 found that 65 percent of jobs in 2020 would require some postsecondary education. But just 35 percent of jobs would demand a four-year degree or better.\par \par \uc2 _____\par \par \uc2 Claim: ''I will stop any trade deal that kills jobs or holds down wages, including the Trans-Pacific Partnership. I oppose it now, I'll oppose it after the \uc2 election\uc2 , and I'll oppose it as president.''\par \par \uc2 Fact Check: What Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  leaves unsaid is that she did not oppose the Trans-Pacific Partnership in the past, before she was a presidential candidate contending with Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, a fiercely anti-trade liberal, for the Democratic nomination. As secretary of state, she backed the Obama administration's negotiations for the trade agreement among the United States and 11 other Pacific Rim nations that would be the largest regional pact in history. Midway through years of talks that concluded in October, she called the emerging agreement the ''gold standard'' of trade pacts.\par \par \uc2 In 2012, for example, she said in Australia, ''This T.P.P. sets the gold standard in trade agreements to open free, transparent, fair trade.'' But just days after the nations' trade ministers announced a final agreement in October, Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  -- under pressure from Mr. Sanders -- expressed opposition, saying it would not raise wages for American workers.\par \par \uc2 _____\par \par \uc2 Claim: By eliminating the estate tax as Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  proposes, ''if you believe that he's as wealthy as he says, that alone would save the \uc2 Trump\uc2  family $4 billion. It would do nothing for 99.8 percent of Americans.''\par \par \uc2 Fact Check: Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  is, mischievously, giving Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  the benefit of the doubt on his claims about his net worth, as she indicated. As such, her calculation could be about right, though it is impossible to know what taxes Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's heirs would pay upon his death without knowing his actual net worth and what estate-tax planning he has done -- like nearly all wealthy people -- to reduce the liability.\par \par \uc2 The businessman has said his net worth is about $10 billion, though even some Republicans have expressed doubt and attributed Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's refusal to release his federal income tax returns to the possibility those would prove he is worth less. The top rate for estate and gift taxes is 40 percent on amounts above $5.45 million (or double that, shielding the first $10.9 million from taxation, if his wife, Melania, survived him). Roughly apply that rate to $10 billion, and estate taxes would be in the range of $4 billion. Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  is also correct that most Americans, including wealthy ones, are not affected now by estate taxes. According to the \uc2 Internal Revenue Service\uc2 , they apply to 0.2 percent of estates.\par \par \uc2 Find out what you need to know about the 2016 presidential race today, and get politics news updates via \uc2 Facebook\uc2 , \uc2 Twitter\uc2  and the First Draft newsletter.\par \par \uc2 Document NYTF000020160812ec8c00049\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 ABROAD IN AMERICA\par \uc2 Foreign Desk; SECT\par \b \uc2 American Muslims and the Politics of Division\b0\par\par\uc2 By DECLAN WALSH \par \uc2 1,314 \uc2 words\par \uc2 12 August 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 The New York Times on the Web\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 For years, Asuman Antepli, a nurse at a hospital in North Carolina , said people mostly just ignored the head-covering hijab she wears as a mark of her Muslim faith.\par \par \uc2 Occasionally, a patient might make an insulting comment, but she would put that down to ignorance. Once, after Osama bin Laden was killed in 2011, men in the street made obscene gestures and cursed at her as she drove home.\par \par \uc2 But in the past year, as \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2  began his dizzying political ascent, things got markedly worse for Ms. Antepli. Some patients, or their relatives, openly recoiled at the sight of her. Others wore \uc2 Trump\uc2  hats and T-shirts, as if to prove a point. A handful have flat-out refused to allow her to treat them, even though she worked in the emergency room.\par \par \uc2 ''It's been very painful,'' said her husband, Abdullah Antepli, who teaches Islamic studies at \uc2 Duke University\uc2  and has heard similar accounts of casual discrimination from his students.\par \par \uc2 So the couple broke into tears recently as they watched another immigrant, Khizr Khan, deliver a stunning rebuke to Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  at the Democratic convention in Philadelphia. Mr. Khan's electrifying speech, in which he described the death of his soldier son, Humayun, in Iraq in 2004, jolted the American political landscape and, after an ugly response from Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , precipitated a steep plunge in the Republican nominee's polling numbers that the he is still struggling to recover from.\par \par \uc2 For American Muslims like Mr. Antepli, the speech arrived with lifesaving urgency -- a perfect riposte to Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  in an \uc2 election\uc2  where Muslims have been, at times, portrayed as disloyal, untrustworthy and dangerous. ''It felt like divine intervention,'' said Mr. Antepli. ''They were undeniably Muslim, undeniably immigrant and undeniably American. This was the mirror that we need to hold up to American society.''\par \par \uc2 The intense focus on Muslims is one part of a broader identity crisis -- spanning race, religion and sexuality -- that this polarizing \uc2 election\uc2  has brought on. Driven by Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's scattershot statements, the divisive politics has drawn battle lines, of sorts, drawing supporters as well as detractors. Unpredictable things happen.\par \par \uc2 In February, Representative Keith Ellison of Minnesota, one of two Muslim members of Congress, took out a full-page newspaper advertisement in his home city of Minneapolis, appealing to Americans to stand against the tide of bigotry and hate. ''Every intolerant social post, every prejudiced comment aimed at Muslims needs a response,'' it said.\par \par \uc2 Although Mr. Ellison is a Democrat, the advertisement was paid for by a local Republican businessman. ''The real story is that folks aren't taking it sitting down,'' Mr. Ellison said. ''It's not just Muslims. Americans of all faiths -- Jews, Christians and others -- are stepping up to the plate.''\par \par \uc2 Mr. Khan -- a Gold Star father, with a son buried at Arlington National Cemetery -- seemed the perfect figure to lead the moral assault on Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 . Yet, the manner in which Mr. Khan was lionized in the American media also aroused discomfort and debate among other American Muslims. Some say it has resurrected the specter of the ''good Muslim'' -- the idea, born of the febrile post-2001 era, that Muslim-American patriotism can be measured only by the yardstick of terrorism and foreign policy.\par \par \uc2 That raised a question: Did Mr. Khan's testimony, determined and powerful as it was, show that it takes the death of a son, in a disputed war in a Muslim land, to prove you are a good American?\par \par \uc2 The debate ''led to an internal moral dilemma,'' said \uc2 Dalia Mogahed\uc2 , a former adviser to President Obama on faith issues, and now a research director at the Institute for Social Policy and Understanding. ''Finally, here was someone with the moral authority to stand up and challenge \uc2 Trump\uc2  on his rhetoric. On the other hand, there was a point of view that we were glorifying military service -- or condoning a war that was misguided and unjust.''\par \par \uc2 The charged argument, she said, mostly took place online, pointing to an old problem among the estimated 3.3 million Muslims in America. Many of them oppose the American foreign policies in Muslim countries like Afghanistan and Pakistan, yet they feel their ability to openly contest those policies is compromised by politicians and media coverage that equates Islam with terrorism, and a fear they will be accused of being fifth columnists.\par \par \uc2 The debate is complicated by recent extremist violence inside the United States, such as the mass shooting in San Bernardino, Calif., by a Muslim couple who claimed to fight for the Islamic State, or the deadly assault on an Orlando, Fla., nightclub by Omar Mateen, the son of an Afghan immigrant.\par \par \uc2 ''It's all become very politicized,'' said Hafsa Kanjwal, a Ph.D. candidate at the \uc2 University of Michigan\uc2 . ''We have Humayan Khan as the 'good Muslim' at one end, and Omar Mateen as the 'bad Muslim' at the other end. Islam is being played up in both instances.''\par \par \uc2 For others, though, it is a matter of pragmatic politics at time when fringe ideas have soaked into the mainstream. As well as calling for Muslim migrants to be barred from entering the United States, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  has proposed shutting down certain mosques, issuing special ID cards to Muslims and creating a federal database to track and monitor all Muslim residents.\par \par \uc2 Some of those ideas appeal to voters, and has appeared to incite violence against Muslims: A recent report by Georgetown University's Center for Muslim-Christian Understanding found that the campaign has coincided with a rise in anti-Muslim violence across the country, including attacks on people and mosques.\par \par \uc2 Mostly, though, the political tensions are percolating into daily life through smaller aggressions, a dozen Muslims from across America said in interviews: casual comments from colleagues, children being bullied at school or hostile stares directed at women who wear head scarves. In April, an Iraqi student was removed from a flight in California after another passenger became alarmed after hearing him speaking in Arabic.\par \par \uc2 Hassan Minhaj, a comedian on ''The Daily Show,'' said that the Republican convention, which he attended, ''felt like a racist Comic-Con.'' But, he added in an interview, ''it was only a small minority who were screaming all these terrifying things. The majority were just ignorant -- they didn't know any better.''\par \par \uc2 Paradoxically, the darkening political clouds come at a time when Muslim voices in America are more prominent, sometimes away from the straitjacketed debate on terrorism. Muslim characters in popular culture, such as television shows, are less stereotyped. Muslim leaders, even those critical of American foreign policy, flocked in June to a Ramadan dinner hosted by President Obama at the White House.\par \par \uc2 One lonely Muslim voice of late, however, has been that of Sajid Tarar -- one of the few Muslims to speak out in Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's defense.\par \par \uc2 In an interview, Mr. Tarar, who was born in Pakistan, said he had received voluminous hate mail from other Muslims which accused him of being a traitor. He echoed Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's talking points about the dangers of ''political correctness'' and Syrian refugees.\par \par \uc2 ''Why are they running from their country to come here?'' he said. ''Why don't they go to Turkey, Jordan and Lebanon? Europe is already burning.''\par \par \uc2 He said that his organization, American Muslims for \uc2 Trump\uc2 , had 500 members.\par \par \uc2 ''I'm part of angry America,'' Mr. Tarar said, reeling off a list of \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's failings. ''As Muslims, we have to show that not all of us are terrorists -- only a certain percentage are troublemakers.''\par \par \uc2 Abroad in America, written by a Times foreign correspondent, approaches the \uc2 election\uc2  in much the same way as we would events overseas, deciphering the action for a global audience.\par \par \uc2 Follow Declan Walsh on Instagram @declanjwalsh and on Twitter @declanwalsh .\par \par \uc2 Document NYTF000020160812ec8c0003k\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 Metropolitan Desk; SECTA\par \b \uc2 Trump\uc2  Tower Takes Center Stage Again\b0\par\par\uc2 By ELI ROSENBERG; Charles V. Bagli and Samantha Schmidt contributed reporting. \par \uc2 1,017 \uc2 words\par \uc2 12 August 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 18\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 In a city full of marquee buildings and landmarks under constant watch, it is just one among many. But as the primary residence of the Republican nominee in the midst of a heated presidential campaign, \uc2 Trump\uc2  Tower holds a particularly high-profile perch.\par \par \uc2 The sleek 68-story edifice of luxury apartments and shops in Midtown Manhattan, already a tourist attraction, has been under a magnifying glass since \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2  kicked off his campaign there last summer. And it has been a stage for many of the same strong emotions inspired by the candidate himself. Seen through the weary gaze of law enforcement, it is a potential target for protests -- which have unfolded there numerous times in the last year -- tussles, or worse.\par \par \uc2 All of which leaves open the question of how a lone man with a collection of gear was able to mount its exterior in broad daylight on Wednesday and climb up 21 floors before anyone was able to stop him. By the time the police pulled the man into the building, he had been climbing for about three hours -- a stunt broadcast live to a wide audience on television and social media. The police identified him as Stephen Rogata, 19, and charged him with felony reckless endangerment and misdemeanor trespassing. They said he had driven from Virginia and checked into an economy-rate hotel on the Bowery in Lower Manhattan the night before the climb.\par \par \uc2 The police said they received a 911 call about the climb shortly after it began around 3:30 p.m. When they came upon Mr. Rogata, he was already five stories up, using power-grip suction cups and what appeared to be a harness to aid his ascent.\par \par \uc2 On Thursday, Mr. Rogata was still at \uc2 Bellevue Hospital Center\uc2 , where he was taken for an evaluation after he was detained, the police said.\par \par \uc2 At \uc2 Trump\uc2  Tower that day, four police officers, including two from a counterterrorism unit, surveyed the premises. Two private security guards stood in the lobby as tourists flowed in and out. At least seven cameras dotted the lobby and the building's exterior, in addition to those on nearby buildings and traffic lights along Fifth Avenue.\par \par \uc2 A spokesman for the New York Police Department said \uc2 Trump\uc2  Tower had at least one police officer posted there every day, an assignment created as the \uc2 election\uc2  cycle has picked up during the last year. \uc2 The \uc2 Trump\uc2  Organization\uc2  did not respond to requests for comment.\par \par \uc2 The climb was hardly the first time a New York City building had been turned into a stage. From Philippe Petit's famous cable walk above the World Trade Center in 1974 to the Puerto Rican nationalists who occupied the Statue of Liberty in 1977, draping the island's flag from the crown, those seeking attention have, at times, found it at the top of the city.\par \par \uc2 But in a social-media-saturated world, the stunts and the outrageous images they often generate have the potential to grab attention more quickly than ever. One video stream of the \uc2 Trump\uc2  Tower climb, posted on \uc2 Facebook\uc2 , drew about 5.8 million views, with a majority of those from people tuning in while the climb was in progress.\par \par \uc2 ''It's so much easier to get your message out and do it live,'' said Glenn Corbett, a professor of security, fire and emergency management at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice. ''Back then all you got was the nightly news.''\par \par \uc2 The developer Douglas Durst spoke about the two climbers who scaled The New York Times Building on the same day in 2008. He said he had taken steps at two of his buildings -- Via 57, a 32-story residential building on the West Side of Manhattan, as well as 1 World Trade Center -- to discourage climbers. At Via, on 57th Street near the West Side Highway, an overhang was designed for the base of the building instead of the angular walls reaching down to the sidewalk that were initially planned.\par \par \uc2 ''We're now very aware of having to design buildings so they are not scalable,'' Mr. Durst said.\par \par \uc2 Security experts described the challenge of securing large buildings as a constant push, one that involved sufficient staffing in addition to shrewd design.\par \par \uc2 ''There's always going to be people who are going to try to steal and commit assault, and climb buildings,'' said Mark Lerner, the president of Epic Security Corporation, which provides security for more than 100 buildings in New York City. ''You need the proper security and personnel to act as a deterrent.''\par \par \uc2 But the precautions have their limitations. Three daredevils sky-dived off the top of the World Trade Center in 2013, filming their exploits from a helmet camera. The next year, a 16-year-old sneaked past security and made it to the top of the 1,776 foot tower.\par \par \uc2 The police said Mr. Rogata told them the brazen stunt had a simple purpose: He wanted to meet Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , a motivation that he laid out in a \uc2 YouTube\uc2  video that was posted before the climb. A spokeswoman for the police said they believed he had ''some type of mental disorder.''\par \par \uc2 Tourists strolled by the tower on Thursday, with some stopping to snap selfies in front of it.\par \par \uc2 Richard Monacchio, 50, who was in town with his 14-year-old son to see a Broadway show, said he decided to visit the tower after watching the video stream.\par \par \uc2 ''I'm surprised security didn't start running out immediately,'' Mr. Monacchio said of the stunt. Still, he added about Mr. Rogata,''I was hoping he would make it.''\par \par \uc2 Stephen Rogata, 19, scaling \uc2 Trump\uc2  Tower on Wednesday. He has been charged with felony reckless endangerment and misdemeanor trespassing. (A18); After hearing of people scaling other buildings, the developer Douglas Durst made sure that Via 57, his residential building on the West Side of Manhattan, was designed to deter climbers.

\par\par \b \uc2 Election\uc2  2016: Puerto Ricans Take Central Role in Battleground State\b0\par\par\uc2 By Nick Timiraos and Beth Reinhard   \par \uc2 473 \uc2 words\par \uc2 12 August 2016\par \uc2 The Wall Street Journal\par \uc2 J\par A4\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 KISSIMMEE, Fla. -- An influx of Puerto Ricans to the U.S. mainland has created a growing bloc of potential voters who don't have hardened partisan loyalties, which could presage an electoral shift in the battleground state of Florida.\par \par \uc2 Tens of thousands of Puerto Ricans have moved to Florida in recent years as the island, an American territory, remains mired in an economic slump and its government faces a cash crunch.\par \par \uc2 They've become prime targets for both parties because they are U.S. citizens by birth, making it easy to register recent arrivals to vote. On the island, Puerto Ricans can't vote for president, and local politics are organized around the statehood question rather than partisanship.\par \par \uc2 "The guys that come from the island don't identify either way, so they're a real prize," said Anthony Suarez, who has been active in Republican politics and is president of the Puerto Rican Bar Association of Florida.\par \par \uc2 Democrats have been active mobilizing voters and see a chance to turn Florida, which narrowly voted for President \uc2 Barack Obama\uc2  in 2012, into a stronghold. "Puerto Ricans in Florida can make Florida a blue state, and not a battleground state anymore," said Puerto Rico Gov. Alejandro Garcia Padilla, a Democrat.\par \par \uc2 President Obama carried the Hispanic vote -- and the state -- in 2008 and 2012. Republicans \uc2 Rick Scott\uc2  and \uc2 Marco Rubio\uc2  won the Hispanic vote in their successful 2010 gubernatorial and \uc2 U.S. senate\uc2  races. Exit polls don't break out the Puerto Rican community.\par \par \uc2 Polls show a close presidential race in Florida, even though Democrat \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  has opened up leads in other swing states. A \uc2 Quinnipiac\uc2  poll Tuesday showed Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  leading Republican \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  46% to 45% among likely voters in a two-way contest.\par \par \uc2 Both Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  and Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  made campaign stops this week in Kissimmee, Fla., the heart of Florida's booming Puerto Rican community.\par \par \uc2 Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  reminded voters Monday that she represented more than one million Puerto Ricans as a senator from New York. "I want to do everything I can to get Puerto Rico back . . . [and] to make sure that they are not left out and left behind," she said.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , however, made no mention of Puerto Rico during a rally here on Thursday night, underscoring what activists in both parties say has been minimal voter outreach by his campaign.\par \par \uc2 Last month, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's campaign inserted pro-statehood language in the Republican platform, said former Puerto Rico Gov. Luis Fortuno, a surrogate for 2012 nominee \uc2 Mitt Romney\uc2  who hasn't endorsed Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 . The platform recognizes the 2012 referendum in which a majority voted for statehood as well as the island's economic struggles.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=wjco20160812000109"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document J000000020160812ec8c0002q\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw272\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4080\pichgoal600

\par\par \b \uc2 Election\uc2  2016: \uc2 Clinton\uc2  Stresses Trade Pact Stance\b0\par\par\uc2 By Nick Timiraos   \par \uc2 552 \uc2 words\par \uc2 12 August 2016\par \uc2 The Wall Street Journal\par \uc2 J\par A4\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  sought to boost her populist appeal against \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  with her fiercest rejection yet of a Pacific trade pact she once lauded and an attack on Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's economic proposals as a crony giveaway.\par \par \uc2 Speaking Thursday in Warren, Mich., Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  offered little new policy but provided one of her more pointed critiques of American trade practices. She flatly stated she would oppose the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a 12-nation trade pact that is a top priority of President \uc2 Barack Obama\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 "I oppose it now. I'll oppose it after the \uc2 election\uc2 , and I'll oppose it as president," said the former secretary of state.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , responding during a rally in Kissimmee, Fla., on Thursday night, said her opposition to the trade pact wasn't sincere. "If she were ever in a position to approve it, she would approve it in two minutes," he said.\par \par \uc2 Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's remarks came two days after Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's address in Detroit that sought to refocus his campaign with an agenda to sharply cut taxes and regulation while advancing a more protectionist trade policy.\par \par \uc2 In response, Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  hammered Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's revamped tax policy as a regressive windfall for the wealthiest Americans, policies she said fused traditional Republican supply-side economics with "outlandish 'Trumpian' ideas that even Republicans reject."\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , addressing the \uc2 National Association of Home Builders\uc2  in Miami Beach, Fla., earlier Thursday, said Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's attacks were an attempt to deflect attention from her proposals to raise taxes and maintain a suite of new regulations championed by Mr. Obama.\par \par \uc2 If Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  were to win the \uc2 election\uc2 , "enjoy your tax increase, folks," he said. "It's going to be four more years of Obama, but it'll be worse."\par \par \uc2 Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , speaking at a manufacturer of aerospace materials, said too many U.S. companies had pushed for trade pacts to export abroad, only to move their operations abroad and export to the U.S. But she said Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's tough talk on trade was motivated by fear and would do little for American workers.\par \par \uc2 Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  has struggled to shake concerns that, once elected, she would tack to the center on trade policy. Mr. Obama did just that in 2008, promising during the presidential campaign to renegotiate the \uc2 North American Free Trade Agreement\uc2  but pursuing new agreements, including the TPP, once elected.\par \par \uc2 Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  looked to use Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's policy speech on Monday to set sharp contrasts on which candidate would deliver for the average worker.\par \par \uc2 She branded Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's proposal to slash taxes on so-called pass-through entities, where business income is claimed on individual tax returns, as the "\uc2 Trump\uc2  loophole." Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  has said he would reduce the top personal tax rate to 33% from 39.6%, but to help small businesses, he has proposed taxing pass-through income at 15%, which is lower than what House Republicans put forward in their tax-code proposal this summer.\par \par \uc2 Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  said the change could potentially deliver a huge benefit to Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's companies and other financiers who were announced as economic advisers to his campaign last week.\par \par \uc2 ---\par \par \uc2 Laura Meckler contributed to this article.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=wjco20160812000106"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document J000000020160812ec8c0002n\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw272\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4080\pichgoal600

\par\par \b \uc2 Email Questions Haunt \uc2 Clinton\b0\par\par\uc2 By Peter Nicholas and Byron Tau   \par \uc2 1,057 \uc2 words\par \uc2 12 August 2016\par \uc2 The Wall Street Journal\par \uc2 J\par A1\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 The email controversy that \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  hoped had died out when federal prosecutors closed their investigation last month now looks likely to shadow her campaign all the way through \uc2 Election\uc2  Day.\par \par \uc2 Rolling releases of emails from Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's time as secretary of state, combined with her own failure to provide succinct, consistent answers on her email practices, have kept the issue simmering.\par \par \uc2 "Any time she talks about it or engages someone on the issue, it just keeps the story alive rather than letting it go away," said Andrew Ricci, a former aide to two Democratic congressmen who is a vice president at the public relations and crisis communications firm Levick.\par \par \uc2 The drumbeat is undercutting Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's candidacy and hindering her efforts to seize fuller control of the presidential race by painting Republican rival \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  as an unacceptable alternative.\par \par \uc2 Last October, 42% of people polled said her use of a private email system while secretary of state was an "important factor" in whether to vote for her, a Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll showed. A survey last month found that figure had jumped to 55%.\par \par \uc2 What's more, half of voters surveyed said she lacked the right judgment to be president based on a \uc2 Federal Bureau of Investigation\uc2  probe that showed she was careless in handling sensitive government information, compared with one-third who said she does have the right judgment.\par \par \uc2 John Podesta\uc2 , the \uc2 Clinton\uc2  campaign chairman, said: "She's said probably about a hundred times now, it [the private email server] was a mistake, wouldn't do it again. She's learned from it."\par \par \uc2 However, Mr. Podesta conceded the issue has lingered. "It's a problem that we've had to cope with, but I think it's one we've tried to put behind us and people are going to have to weigh that against an opponent on the other side who remains kind of outrageous every day," he said.\par \par \uc2 The campaign's decision to eschew news conferences also limits Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's ability to put the issue to rest. The Democrat hasn't held a full news conference since Dec. 4, 2015, although aides said she has taken more than 2,600 questions from reporters this year on a variety of subjects.\par \par \uc2 Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  did take questions from reporters after an appearance last week, and offered a new, and muddled, response to the email flap that stirred fresh headlines.\par \par \uc2 "Her fear of the media -- which manifests itself by her refusal to regularly do press conferences -- only furthers her reputation as a politician that values secrecy over transparency," said John Feehery, a Republican strategist. "I think she has made a mess of it, but it doesn't resonate because everybody is watching the more fascinating train wreck that is the \uc2 Trump\uc2  campaign."\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  has called the email scandal evidence that Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  lacks the judgment to occupy the Oval Office. In a tweet last month, he wrote that she and her team "were extremely careless in their handling of very sensitive, highly classified information" and ended with the words "Not Fit!"\par \par \uc2 Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's challenge is compounded by the fact that it is multifaceted: She has been criticized for hosting her email on a private server as well as for the content of some of her messages, those of top aides and correspondence from people who didn't work for her.\par \par \uc2 A conservative watchdog group released this week about 300 pages of emails that included instances of \uc2 Clinton\uc2  Foundation\uc2  officials asking State Department aides to provide foundation donors access to government officials.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  said the emails pointed to what he called "pay for play," a charge the \uc2 Clinton\uc2  campaign denied. The campaign also noted that Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  wasn't part of those email conversations among various staff members.\par \par \uc2 More emails are likely to be released over the coming months, as a raft of advocacy groups and media outlets have sued the State Department for everything from Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's schedules to deleted messages recovered by the \uc2 FBI\uc2  during its investigation into her private email account and server.\par \par \uc2 While Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  said she had turned over all her work-related correspondence, agents found thousands of previously undisclosed work emails and have been giving them to the State Department. Those emails are expected to come out, too, though the timeline is uncertain.\par \par \uc2 "As we have just received this material from the \uc2 FBI\uc2  we are still assessing what our process will look like," said State Department spokeswoman Elizabeth Trudeau.\par \par \uc2 Driving the issue as well are Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's varying explanations of her email practices. For months she was reluctant to concede she had done anything wrong in using a private server to do government work.\par \par \uc2 Then, when she couldn't ignore the issue, she has explained her actions in the best possible light, diving into the particulars of government email classification procedures in ways that some communications experts say haven't always aided her case.\par \par \uc2 "It's clear that the choice of a private email server was a mistake. It's also clear that an inconsistent pattern of responses has not been helpful," said Stephen Farnsworth, author of "Spinner in Chief: How Presidents Sell their Policies and Themselves."\par \par \uc2 In May, the State Department's inspector general released a report that seemed to undercut Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's defense. He wrote that her exclusive use of a private email server wasn't permitted under department policies.\par \par \uc2 In an ABC News interview the next day, she again said what she had done was "allowed," though she added she had made a "mistake" that she wouldn't repeat.\par \par \uc2 More recently, Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  told Fox News Sunday that FBI Director James Comey "said my answers were truthful, and what I've said is consistent with what I have told the American people,"\par \par \uc2 Though Mr. Comey said she hadn't lied in her private interview with the \uc2 FBI\uc2  last month, he declined to characterize remarks she has made publicly.\par \par \uc2 That exchange touched off another round of inquiries by fact-checkers and critics. PolitiFact, a nonpartisan website that rates the truthfulness of political comments, declared Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's assertion "Pants on Fire!"\par \par \uc2 ---\par \par \uc2 Laura Meckler and Colleen McCain Nelson contributed to this article.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=wjco20160812000097"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document J000000020160812ec8c0002e\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw272\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4080\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 Republican presidential candidate \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  defended his remarks calling President \uc2 Barack Obama\uc2  the "founder" of ISIS and Democratic rival \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  the "co-founder."\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  first made the charges at a rally Wednesday in Florida, claiming the terrorist group, also known as Islamic State or ISIL, "honors" Mr. Obama. In fact, the Obama administration has launched numerous attacks on ISIS in Iraq and Syria, harming the group.\par \par \uc2 Radio host Hugh Hewitt asked Thursday if he meant to say that Mr. Obama indirectly created ISIS by creating a power vacuum in Iraq when he pulled most troops from the country. "No," Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  replied. "I meant he's the founder of ISIS. He was the most valuable player."\par \par \uc2 When Mr. Hewitt said Democrats would seize on the "founder" comment to attack Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's foreign-policy views, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  repeated that he hadn't erred. "Everyone's liking it," he said.\par \par \uc2 In a statement, \uc2 Clinton\uc2  adviser Jake Sullivan said: "This is a false claim from a presidential candidate with an aversion to the truth and an unprecedented lack of knowledge."\par \par \uc2 A White House spokesman declined to comment.\par \par \uc2 Asked in a CNBC interview how he plans to close the gap in recent polling that shows him falling behind in critical swing states, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  said he didn't plan to change his campaigning style.\par \par \uc2 "Just keep doing the same thing I'm doing right now," he said about his efforts to win the race. "And at the end it's either going to work, or I'm going, you know, I'm going to have a very, very nice long vacation."\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=wjco20160812000060"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document J000000020160812ec8c0001l\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw272\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4080\pichgoal600

\par\par \b \uc2 Election\uc2  2016: Bridge-Lane Scandal Resurfaces for Christie\b0\par\par\uc2 By Ted Mann and Josh Dawsey \par \uc2 525 \uc2 words\par \uc2 11 August 2016\par \uc2 The Wall Street Journal\par \uc2 J\par A5\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Three years after a scandal first disrupted New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie's path to national office, fresh revelations in the case are again proving how hard it can be for the governor to move on.\par \par \uc2 The latest episode in the George Washington Bridge traffic jam controversy came in a pretrial court filing early Wednesday. Defense lawyers for a former Christie associate unveiled a December 2013 text-message exchange in which a governor's staffer told another aide that the governor was lying during a press conference.\par \par \uc2 At that conference, Mr. Christie said he had been told none of his staff were involved in efforts to intentionally trigger traffic jams at the bridge over several days in September 2013.\par \par \uc2 The lying charge is "ridiculous," the second-term Republican governor told reporters Wednesday morning. Mr. Christie said there was "nothing new" in the court filing and said the former aide who had accused him of lying, Christina Renna, was "wrong."\par \par \uc2 "The Governor's statements have been clear," a spokesman said later by email. "Nothing contained in this text message changes that in any way."\par \par \uc2 Prosecutors have said the architects of the traffic jams were three Christie allies, including his deputy chief of staff, who intended to punish the Democratic mayor of the town at the foot of the bridge connecting New Jersey and New York for declining to endorse \uc2 Mr. Christie's\uc2  re-\uc2 election\uc2 . One of the three, a former official of the \uc2 Port Authority of New York and New Jersey\uc2  , has pleaded guilty to conspiracy.\par \par \uc2 Two other Christie allies have pleaded not guilty and will go to trial in mid-September.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Christie hasn't been charged with wrongdoing in the case, and that was unchanged by Wednesday's court brief, filed in federal court in Newark. Still, the disclosure was a reminder of the case's enduring power to hobble his national ambitions, first as a GOP presidential candidate and then as a possible running mate to nominee Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  .\par \par \uc2 "It is unfortunate that so much capital and so much opportunity was lost due to this episode, which was a horrible one," said state Sen. Joe Kyrillos, a veteran GOP lawmaker and longtime backer of \uc2 Mr. Christie's\uc2  until he jumped sides to support Jeb Bush in the Republican presidential primary.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Christie's\uc2  term ends at the end of 2017, and he isn't seeking a third term. But aides and allies are concerned that the coming trial will further damp his hopes to move beyond the state capital in Trenton.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Christie dropped out of the GOP presidential race early this year and became a top surrogate of Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's. He was said to be a final choice for running mate and would like to be a cabinet pick should Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  win, according to people who know Mr. Christie.\par \par \uc2 In particular, Christie associates fear the coming trial testimony from former close aides like \uc2 David Wildstein\uc2 , one of these people said, and the ties the alleged perpetrators had with the governor -- ties the administration has played down.\par \par \uc2 Document J000000020160811ec8b00029\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 National Desk; SECTA\par \b \uc2 Amid Defections, One Ally Stands by \uc2 Trump\uc2 : N.R.A.\b0\par\par\uc2 By NICK CORASANITI and ALEXANDER BURNS; Maggie Haberman and Kitty Bennett contributed reporting. \par \uc2 1,517 \uc2 words\par \uc2 11 August 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 1\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's candidacy has driven away throngs of Republican elected officials, donors and policy experts. But not the \uc2 National Rifle Association\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 With Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  increasingly isolated and hobbled by controversies of his own making, the powerful gun-rights group has emerged as one of his remaining stalwart allies in the Republican coalition: the institution on the right most aggressively committed to his candidacy, except for the \uc2 Republican National Committee\uc2  itself.\par \par \uc2 The association has spent millions of dollars on television commercials for Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , even as other Republican groups have kept their checkbooks closed and Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's campaign has not run any ads of its own. The N.R.A.'s chief political strategist, Chris Cox, gave a forceful testimonial for Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  at the Republican convention; Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  has repeatedly praised Mr. Cox and the association's executive vice president, Wayne LaPierre.\par \par \uc2 And on Tuesday, when Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  roiled the presidential race anew with a rough comment -- his critics interpreted it as a suggestion that ''Second Amendment people'' could attack \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  or the judges she would appoint if elected president -- the association rushed to defend his remark as no more than an attempt to rally gun enthusiasts to vote in November.\par \par \uc2 Allies of Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  and the association describe their political alliance as a marriage forged out of urgent necessity: an unlikely pairing of a former gun-control proponent who lives in a Manhattan skyscraper with an advocacy group typically seen as speaking for gun manufacturers and the hunters and sportsmen of Middle America.\par \par \uc2 But Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  has effectively romanced the pro-gun community with a message of fierce support for Second Amendment rights. And the N.R.A., spurred by concern about Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's power to name Supreme Court judges, has reciprocated his overtures with enthusiasm.\par \par \uc2 Helping to establish that connection have been Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's sons, Donald Jr. and Eric, avid hunters with ties to the N.R.A. Donald Jr., Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's oldest son, spoke about the importance of gun rights on a visit to Capitol Hill in the spring.\par \par \uc2 On the campaign trail, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  makes a show of embracing the association and its leadership, while accusing Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  of seeking to do away with the Second Amendment.\par \par \uc2 ''We're going to help the N.R.A., who are great people,'' he said on Tuesday in Fayetteville, N.C. ''They're fighting hard, they're fighting hard. Chris and Wayne and all their people at the N.R.A., these are people that love our country.''\par \par \uc2 The alliance with Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  comes at a moment of peril for the N.R.A. and its agenda, as Democrats threaten to take control of the Senate and polls show the public increasingly supportive of at least modest new limits on the sale and possession of firearms.\par \par \uc2 Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  and other Democrats have run explicitly against the N.R.A. in this \uc2 election\uc2 , attacking the gun lobby for opposing laws intended to restrict gun sales to people with mental illnesses or whose names are on the federal terrorism watch list. They have held up the N.R.A. as a uniquely sinister organization, and cast themselves as opponents of the group rather than of gun owners in general.\par \par \uc2 In her acceptance speech at the Democratic convention last month, Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  said the country could not have a president ''in the pocket of the gun lobby.''\par \par \uc2 ''I'm not here to repeal the Second Amendment,'' she told the crowd in Philadelphia. ''I'm not here to take away your guns. I just don't want you to be shot by someone who shouldn't have a gun in the first place.''\par \par \uc2 Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , who has campaigned with gun-control advocates like the former congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords and her husband, Mark Kelly, told a crowd in Iowa on Wednesday that Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's provocative remark about Second Amendment supporters showed he was unfit to be president. She called it ''the latest in a long line of casual comments from \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  that cross the line.''\par \par \uc2 The N.R.A. is expected to intensify its efforts on Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's behalf, association officials said, increasing its spending on television commercials and wielding its extensive network of activists to help turn out voters sympathetic to Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 The N.R.A. has spent nearly $6 million this year on advertising supporting Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , focusing its latest efforts on the swing states of Nevada, North Carolina, Ohio and Pennsylvania, where Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  and his running mate, \uc2 Gov. Mike Pence\uc2  of Indiana, have been campaigning heavily. That sum -- a tiny fraction of what has been spent on commercials backing Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  -- is the largest expenditure for ads helping Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  in the general \uc2 election\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 At this point in the last two presidential elections, the N.R.A. had not spent a single dollar on commercials backing the Republican nominees, \uc2 John McCain\uc2  in 2008 and \uc2 Mitt Romney\uc2  in 2012, according to the ad tracking firm Kantar Media/CMAG. In 2004, the rifle association spent just $61,000 aiding President George W. Bush's re-\uc2 election\uc2  bid, and only in Washington.\par \par \uc2 Rebuilding America Now, a super PAC supporting Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's candidacy, also appears to be ramping up its activities, with roughly $1 million added to its advertising plans for the next six days in four battleground states.\par \par \uc2 Grover Norquist\uc2 , an anti-tax activist who sits on the rifle association's board, said the 2016 race was uniquely explosive because control of the Supreme Court hangs in the balance and Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  has spoken critically of judicial decisions that take a broad interpretation of the right to own guns.\par \par \uc2 ''\uc2 Trump\uc2  in his public statements, in his speech at the convention, is the most pro-Second Amendment presidential candidate of either party in living memory,'' Mr. Norquist said. ''And we haven't had a presidential candidate declare war on the Second Amendment community as aggressively as Hillary.''\par \par \uc2 Mr. Norquist said that the N.R.A. and other Second Amendment groups were determined to reach voters who are concerned about crime and self-defense, and who might hold permits to carry concealed weapons but were not recreational gun users like hunters and sportsmen. They may not fit the conventional profile of gun owners, he said, and may be more likely to live in battleground states like Florida, Michigan and Pennsylvania.\par \par \uc2 ''They are more suburban,'' Mr. Norquist said. ''They are more likely to be swing voters and not necessarily N.R.A. members.''\par \par \uc2 The N.R.A.'s ads have focused on themes of self-defense and fear -- and on persuading gun owners that they should fear Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 : Its latest commercial, released Tuesday, accused her of hypocrisy, saying she surrounded herself with armed guards while trying to take away Americans' firearms, leaving them ''defenseless.''\par \par \uc2 At times, the association has taken its advocacy for Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  well beyond gun rights. With no well-funded ''super PAC'' running ads for Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , the N.R.A. stepped into that role in late June, releasing an ad on an entirely unrelated issue. The commercial featured a survivor of the 2012 attack in Benghazi, Libya, criticizing Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's handling of it. It made no mention of guns or any other domestic policy issue.\par \par \uc2 And the N.R.A. has used its digital channels, which reach more than five million members, to echo Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's messages: Ginny Simone, a reporter for NRA News, the association's online channel, recently offered a glowing video package showcasing Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's convention speech and trumpeting his support among gun owners.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  has not always been such a clear ally of the gun lobby. When he considered a bid for president in 2000, he repeatedly expressed support for a crackdown on gun ownership, and criticized Republicans who, he said, ''walk the N.R.A. line and refuse even limited restrictions.''\par \par \uc2 But this year, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  has gone to unusual lengths to get along with the organization. When the group offered rare criticism of him in June, for suggesting after the nightclub massacre in Orlando, Fla., that patrons there should have been armed, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  took the unusual step of walking back his remarks.\par \par \uc2 His intention, he insisted, had been to suggest that more armed guards at the nightclub would have been helpful.\par \par \uc2 Find out what you need to know about the 2016 presidential race today, and get politics news updates via \uc2 Facebook\uc2 , \uc2 Twitter\uc2  and the First Draft newsletter.\par \par \uc2 A rally for Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2  in Sunrise, Fla.

\par\par \uc2 Metropolitan Desk; SECTA\par \b \uc2 Police Pluck Climber Off \uc2 Trump\uc2  Tower as the Internet Watches\b0\par\par\uc2 By ELI ROSENBERG and MEGAN JULA \par \uc2 832 \uc2 words\par \uc2 11 August 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 18\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 A lone man's climb up the side of \uc2 Trump\uc2  Tower became a New York City spectacle on Wednesday afternoon after thousands watched his ascent in real time on television, through social media and in person.\par \par \uc2 The man was pulled off the building's facade and apprehended by police officers who had removed a glass panel on the 21st floor about three hours into his climb. By then, he had become a social media sensation, as people watched live videos posted on \uc2 Facebook\uc2  and Periscope, a live video-streaming app. A stream on \uc2 Facebook\uc2  from WABC-TV in New York received more than four million views, and people commented along with the action. Clad in shorts and a T-shirt, the climber began to scale the building around 3:30 p.m., the police said, wearing a harness and using what appeared to be suction cups to aid his climb.\par \par \uc2 Trump\uc2  Tower climber in #NYPD custody where Ivanka \uc2 Trump\uc2  sells her shoes pic.twitter.com/46x5qQnPUQ -- Aaron Katersky (@AaronKatersky) August 10, 2016\par \par \uc2 William Aubry, the New York Police Department's assistant chief of the Manhattan South detective squad, told reporters that the man was a 20-year-old from Virginia who had told them he sought to scale the tower with one purpose: to gain a personal meeting with \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , the Republican presidential nominee. Police officials said he told them about a \uc2 YouTube\uc2  video he posted on Tuesday that explained his motives. In the widely shared video that matched the police's description, titled ''Message to Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  (why I climbed your tower),'' a hooded man claimed he was an ''independent researcher.'' ''Believe me, if my purpose was not significant, I would not risk my life pursuing it,'' the man said solemnly. ''The reason I climbed your tower was to get your attention.''\par \par \uc2 Police did not release the name of the man, whom they took to \uc2 Bellevue Hospital Center\uc2  for an evaluation.\par \par \uc2 On Wednesday night, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  expressed his appreciation for the police on \uc2 Twitter\uc2 , writing, ''Great job today by the \uc2 NYPD\uc2  in protecting the people and saving the climber.''\par \par \uc2 Great job today by the \uc2 NYPD\uc2  in protecting the people and saving the the climber. -- \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2  (@realDonaldTrump) August 11, 2016\par \par \uc2 Livestreaming, which increasingly draws wide audiences, has helped turn the outlandish happenings that occur periodically in a place like New York into viral public events. In June, a broadcast primarily seen on Periscope of a naked man whom the police described as ''emotionally disturbed'' became a similar public spectacle.\par \par \uc2 With the climber's image being broadcast -- and commented on -- far and wide on Wednesday, the man perched, if only briefly, at the intersection of two unpredictable worlds: the combustible presidential campaign and the chaotic city beneath him.\par \par \uc2 The climb and frenzy that followed were also the latest instance in which \uc2 Trump\uc2  Tower has starred in a noteworthy role during the campaign. The building on Fifth Avenue, the site of Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's campaign launch and his residence, has prompted some of the same strong emotions as those inspired by the candidate himself.\par \par \uc2 It has been a magnet for those making political statements: a protester in a Ku Klux Klan-style hood who tussled with security guards in September; 200 marchers in December; anti-gun activists in the spring. It has also been the site of a zoning tussle, magnified by the stakes of the presidential \uc2 election\uc2 , after the \uc2 Trump\uc2  Organization\uc2  was forced to remove a \uc2 Trump\uc2  kiosk from its lobby, which had been designated as a public space as part of an agreement that allowed the developer to add 20 stories to the building's height.\par \par \uc2 And it has burnished its status as a tourist attraction, drawing more than one million visitors every year from around the globe.\par \par \uc2 2 windows have been removed from the 21 floor and #NYPD ESU is attempting to talk the climber in. pic.twitter.com/nzATOPNFsW -- Sgt. Carlos Nieves (@NYPDNieves) August 10, 2016\par \par \uc2 On Wednesday, hundreds of people gawked from the streets below, filming the climb with cameras and phones, oohing after the man dropped an object. Some cheered for him, remarking on the difficulty of his climb. ''You will never believe what I just saw,'' a woman leaving the commotion said into her cellphone.\par \par \uc2 Aaron Hesseltine, 17, in town with his family from Saranac Lake, N.Y., to see Alex Rodriguez's last game with the \uc2 Yankees\uc2 , watched for an hour and a half, documenting the experience on Snapchat for his friends at home. His last missive showed the moment the climber disappeared into the opening.\par \par \uc2 ''They got him,'' it read.\par \par \uc2 A man's slow ascent of the 68-story building in Manhattan became a social media sensation. Below, people watched his climb -- and documented it.

\par\par \uc2 EDITORIAL\par \uc2 Editorial Desk; SECTA\par \b \uc2 A Policing Culture Built on Racism\b0\par\par\uc2 By THE EDITORIAL BOARD \par \uc2 549 \uc2 words\par \uc2 11 August 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 22\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 The scathing federal report this week on the reality of racist abuse by the police in Baltimore was hardly news to the African-American neighborhoods most victimized by ironhanded law enforcement. Community leaders have been complaining for years about police policies that swept up innocent black citizens beyond all bounds of constitutional justice -- stopping, frisking and arresting residents without justification, then releasing them without criminal charges or so much as an apology.\par \par \uc2 The 14-month study, prompted by the death of Freddie Gray, a 25-year-old black man who died last year of a broken spine suffered while in police custody, confirmed the black community's harsh daily experience at the hands of Baltimore police officers, who are driven by an aggressive ''zero tolerance'' policy that federal investigators found to be ''alienating the civilians they are meant to serve.'' This was the complaint heard in the mass protests and street riots that followed the death of Mr. Gray -- a theme echoed in similar deadly confrontations across the nation.\par \par \uc2 Baltimore is 63 percent African-American, yet black residents accounted for 84 percent of police stops -- and 95 percent of 410 individuals found to have been unjustifiably stopped at least 10 times in a five-and-a-half-year period, according to the report. In that period, officers stopped 34 black residents at least 20 times each, and seven 30 times or more. No individuals of any other race were stopped more than 12 times each.\par \par \uc2 Without cause or a legitimate suspicion, officers routinely stopped and questioned individuals posing no criminal threat, the report emphasized. No charges were filed in 26 of every 27 pedestrian stops. Citizens could be arrested unlawfully when officers simply ''did not like what those individuals said.'' One supervisor advised a patrol officer who protested: ''Make something up.''\par \par \uc2 Some police officers are being fired as the city's law enforcement and political leaders embark on a sweeping reform of police practices -- a difficult task that will take time and millions of dollars to retrain officers on such crucial standards as the legitimate use of force. City and federal officials are negotiating a reform plan that would be monitored by a federal judge for compliance.\par \par \uc2 It is no coincidence that the Baltimore report was issued just as the Justice Department began moving forward with a plan to better track killings of civilians by police officers. Repeated protests over police killings in black communities have laid bare the fact that there is little real oversight or accountability for such deaths. The Justice Department is aiming for a system of quarterly reports from the nation's more than 25,000 local police forces and medical examiners.\par \par \uc2 Investigations similar to the one in Baltimore have begun in nearly a dozen cities, including Chicago, Cleveland and Ferguson, Mo. Whether the Justice Department in the next administration will maintain this pressure for reform very much depends on the outcome of this year's presidential \uc2 election\uc2 , where \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  is the only candidate who has shown commitment to carrying out the tough remedies needed to rein in police abuses.\par \par \uc2 Follow The \uc2 New York Times\uc2  Opinion section on \uc2 Facebook\uc2  and \uc2 Twitter\uc2  (@NYTOpinion), and sign up for the Opinion Today newsletter.\par \par \uc2 Document NYTF000020160811ec8b0006h\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 WASHINGTON -- A Russian cyberattack that targeted Democratic politicians was bigger than it first appeared and breached the private email accounts of more than 100 party officials and groups, officials with knowledge of the case said Wednesday.\par \par \uc2 The widening scope of the attack has prompted the F.B.I. to broaden its investigation, and agents have begun notifying a long list of Democratic officials that the Russians may have breached their personal accounts.\par \par \uc2 The main targets appear to have been the personal email accounts of \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's campaign officials and party operatives, along with a number of party organizations.\par \par \uc2 Officials have acknowledged that the Russian hackers gained access to the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, which is the fund-raising arm for House Democrats, and to the \uc2 Democratic National Committee\uc2 , including a D.N.C. voter analytics program used by Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's presidential campaign.\par \par \uc2 But the hack now appears to have extended well beyond those groups, and organizations like the Democratic Governors' Association may also have been affected, according to Democrats involved in the investigation.\par \par \uc2 Democrats say they are bracing for the possibility that another batch of damaging or embarrassing internal material could become public before the November presidential \uc2 election\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 The attack has already proved politically damaging. On the eve of the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia last month, Representative \uc2 Debbie Wasserman Schultz\uc2  resigned as D.N.C. chairwoman after \uc2 WikiLeaks\uc2  released a trove of hacked internal emails showing party officials eager for Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  to win the nomination over Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont.\par \par \uc2 American intelligence agencies have said they have ''high confidence'' that the attack was the work of Russian intelligence agencies. It has injected a heavy dose of international intrigue into an already chaotic presidential campaign as Democrats have alleged that the Russians are trying to help tilt the \uc2 election\uc2  toward the Republican nominee, \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  stunned Democrats and Republicans when he said last month that he hoped Russian intelligence services had successfully hacked Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's email, and encouraged them to publish whatever they may have stolen, although he said later that he was being sarcastic.\par \par \uc2 Intelligence and law enforcement officials, however, are taking the issue seriously.\par \par \uc2 F.B.I. officials briefed staff members of House and Senate Intelligence Committees last week on the investigation into the theft of emails and documents from the \uc2 Democratic National Committee\uc2 . Briefings for other congressional committees are expected in the coming days.\par \par \uc2 Much of the briefing to the committee staff focused on the fact that American intelligence agencies have virtually no doubt that the Russian government was behind the theft, according to one staff member, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss elements of the confidential briefing.\par \par \uc2 The extension of the hack's scope beyond the D.N.C. and the House Democratic committee added a troubling new element to the case, the staff member said.\par \par \uc2 American authorities remain uncertain whether the electronic break-in to the committee's computer systems was intended as fairly routine cyberespionage or as part of an effort to manipulate the presidential \uc2 election\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Russian motives are still an open question, said a federal law enforcement official, who also spoke on condition of anonymity.\par \par \uc2 There is no evidence so far that the theft penetrated the emails of lawmakers or staff members who serve on the Intelligence Committees, two staff members said.\par \par \uc2 The F.B.I. says it has no direct evidence that Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's private email server was hacked by the Russians or anyone else. But in June, the F.B.I. director, James B. Comey, said that intruders had tried, and that any successful intruders were probably far too skilled to leave evidence of their intrusion behind. Law enforcement officials said he had the Russians in mind.\par \par \uc2 Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's aides were concerned about the possibility of an outside breach after a hacker calling himself ''Guccifer'' got into the email account in 2013 of Sidney Blumenthal, a longtime confidante of Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's who often emailed her on her private server, according to new documents released Wednesday.\par \par \uc2 Cheryl D. Mills\uc2 , a lawyer and adviser for Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , said she discussed the 2013 hack with the technician who ran Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's private server and considered ''whether this event might affect Secretary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's email,'' according to a written account Ms. Mills provided to \uc2 Judicial Watch\uc2 , a conservative legal group that is suing the State Department.\par \par \uc2 So far, it does not appear that the Russian hackers sought or gained access to any computer systems used by Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , who is known to avoid email, officials said.\par \par \uc2 Since news of the D.N.C. hack broke in June, a number of Democratic organizations have been scrubbing their files to determine what internal information might have been compromised. They have also been shoring up their cybersecurity defenses to guard against another attack.\par \par \uc2 An official with the D.N.C., speaking on condition of anonymity, said the committee took the threat very seriously, but would not comment on specific security steps taken.\par \par \uc2 WikiLeaks\uc2 , the group that put out the D.N.C. emails publicly last month, interjected itself into the hacking case again this week when it offered a $20,000 reward for information on the shooting death last month of a former D.N.C. staff member, Seth Rich, outside his Washington home. His killing fueled speculation on the internet that he was somehow tied to the hacked emails, but the police have not given any credence to that speculation.\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 WikiLeaks\uc2  founder, Julian Assange, has made it clear that he would like to hurt Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's bid for the White House, opposing her candidacy on policy and personal grounds. He has hinted that he has more material about the presidential campaign that he could release.\par \par \uc2 Follow The \uc2 New York Times\uc2 's politics and Washington coverage on \uc2 Facebook\uc2  and \uc2 Twitter\uc2 , and sign up for the First Draft politics newsletter.\par \par \uc2 Representative Debbie Wasserman Schultz at the Democratic National Convention last month.

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Hillary and \uc2 Bill \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's shift over the years from middle class to multimillionaires has been perhaps most pronounced in the places they have called home.\par \par \uc2 For 18 consecutive years, the Clintons lived in government-provided housing, from the Arkansas governor's mansion to the White House. Should Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  win the presidency in November, they would become the first ''first couple'' to swap roles and return to the White House.\par \par \uc2 Here's a look at the Clintons' homes over the years:\par \par \uc2 West \uc2 Clinton\uc2  Drive, Fayetteville, Ark.\par \par \uc2 When They Were There: 1975-76\par \par \uc2 What They Paid For It: $17,200\par \par \uc2 What Was Going On in Their Lives: On Oct. 11, 1975, Bill and Hillary, then both law professors, were married in the living room of this Tudor revival home. The building, now a museum, is one of the four stops on the ''Billgrimage'' tour of Mr. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's pre-White House life.\par \par \uc2 _____\par \par \uc2 L Street, Little Rock, Ark.\par \par \uc2 When They Were There: 1976-78\par \par \uc2 What Was Going On in Their Lives: Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  had a hard time adjusting to life in Little Rock, which was more conservative than the college town of Fayetteville. The 1,394-square-foot, two-bedroom, two-bathroom home where they lived while Mr. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  was attorney general was a pit stop on the way to the governor's mansion.\par \par \uc2 _____\par \par \uc2 Midland Street, Little Rock\par \par \uc2 When They Were There: 1980-82\par \par \uc2 What They Paid For It: $112,000\par \par \uc2 What Was Going On in Their Lives: Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  partly used the proceeds from her investments and her savings to put a $60,000 down payment on the home, in the city's Hillcrest district, purchased in the dark days after Mr. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  lost his re-\uc2 election\uc2  bid for governor. She built wooden bookshelves in a sunny office (which locals joke was the first \uc2 Clinton\uc2  Library) and converted the attic into a room for Chelsea, who celebrated her first birthday and learned to walk there.\par \par \uc2 _____\par \par \uc2 Old House Lane, Chappaqua, N.Y.\par \par \uc2 When They Were There: 1999 to present\par \par \uc2 What They Paid For It: $1.7 million\par \par \uc2 What Was Going On in Their Lives: Laden with debt from legal bills while they were in the White House, the Clintons initially accepted help from their friend and fund-raiser \uc2 Terry McAuliffe\uc2  to secure the mortgage on the home, but turned down the offer amid criticism. The 11-room Dutch colonial in a wooded New York suburb in Westchester County gave Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  a perch from which she could run for a Senate seat from New York.\par \par \uc2 The Clintons spend most of their downtime here, binge-watching ''The Good Wife'' and ''Downton Abbey'' and hosting Thanksgiving meals with Chelsea and her friends.\par \par \uc2 _____\par \par \uc2 Whitehaven Street, Washington\par \par \uc2 When They Were There: 2000 to present\par \par \uc2 What They Paid For It: $2.85 million\par \par \uc2 What Was Going On in Their Lives: With Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  set to represent New York in the Senate, the Clintons needed a home in Washington. The 5,500-square-foot home, in an area known as ''Embassy Row,'' takes up a third of an acre on a tree-lined lot, and has seven bedrooms, a den, a pool and a terrace. The relatively secure location makes it a favorite place for the Clintons to entertain and hold meetings away from prying reporters' eyes.\par \par \uc2 _____\par \par \uc2 President \uc2 Clinton\uc2  Avenue, Little Rock\par \par \uc2 When They Were There: 2004 to present, on and off\par \par \uc2 What Was Going On in Their Lives: Perched atop the \uc2 Clinton\uc2  library (which locals joke looks like a glass trailer park) is a tastefully decorated private residence where the Clintons stay when they're in Little Rock. The apartment has a sprawling terrace overlooking the Arkansas River and the aptly named \uc2 Clinton\uc2  Presidential Park Bridge. Mr. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , famously a night owl, is known to tap into the archives to frequently redecorate with memorabilia from his presidency.\par \par \uc2 Find out what you need to know about the 2016 presidential race today, and get politics news updates via \uc2 Facebook\uc2 , \uc2 Twitter\uc2  and the First Draft newsletter.\par \par \uc2 Document NYTF000020160811ec8b00043\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 National Desk; SECTA\par \b \uc2 Strained Finances Left \uc2 Clinton\uc2  Juggling Necessity and Ideals\b0\par\par\uc2 By AMY CHOZICK; Kitty Bennett contributed reporting from Seattle, and Steve Eder from New York. \par \uc2 2,764 \uc2 words\par \uc2 11 August 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 13\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 LITTLE ROCK, Ark. -- Losing the governor's race here in 1980 so shattered a young \uc2 Bill \uc2 Clinton\uc2  that he could not face his supporters, so he sent his wife around to thank campaign workers instead. He later gathered with close friends for dinner but quietly sulked, playing the country song ''I Don't Know Whether to Kill Myself or Go Bowling'' on the jukebox.\par \par \uc2 But his wife had a more pressing concern: money. The ousted governor needed a job, the family needed a place to live, and moving out of the governor's mansion meant losing the help they had as they raised their 9-month-old daughter, Chelsea.\par \par \uc2 The morning after the \uc2 election\uc2 , Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  worked the phones from the mansion, calling wealthy friends and asking for help.\par \par \uc2 ''The world changed. There was a tectonic shift,'' said \uc2 Thomas F. McLarty III\uc2 , a friend of Mr. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's who served as his White House chief of staff.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  was of little use as he fixated on voters' rejection. And for the first time, friends said, Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  glimpsed fragility in the future she had moved to Arkansas to pursue. She worried about saving for Chelsea's college, caring for her aging parents, and even possibly supporting herself should the marriage or their political dreams dissolve.\par \par \uc2 ''It was up to her to just keep holding things up,'' said Nancy Pietrafesa, a college friend of Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's who moved to Arkansas to work for Mr. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  in the 1970s.\par \par \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's relationship with money has long puzzled even some of her closest supporters: Despite choosing a life in government, she has appeared eager to make money, driven to provide for her family and helping amass a fortune of more than $50 million with her husband.\par \par \uc2 But Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  can seem blind to how her financial decisions are viewed, and has suffered repeated political damage and accusations of conflicts of interest as a result -- from serving on the corporate board of \uc2 Walmart\uc2  while her husband was governor to initially accepting a $1.35 million mortgage personally secured by a top fund-raiser for the family's home in Chappaqua, N.Y.\par \par \uc2 Her collection of more than $21 million in speaking fees from a range of groups, including Wall Street firms and other interests, led to one of the most potent attacks against her in this \uc2 election\uc2  cycle, given voters' anger about economic inequality. Half of all voters said it bothered them ''a lot'' that Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  gave numerous speeches to Wall Street banks, according to a Bloomberg Politics poll conducted in June.\par \par \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2  has called Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  ''totally owned by Wall Street.''\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , whose own finances have drawn extensive scrutiny, may be an imperfect messenger, but ''Republicans can say, 'This undercuts everything she is saying about what she wants to do to regulate Wall Street and her economic populist stance,''' said \uc2 Anna Greenberg\uc2 , a Democratic pollster.\par \par \uc2 Even some of Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's allies privately say they are mystified by her choice to make the Wall Street speeches, given the likelihood that they would become an issue in a presidential campaign. And to some of them, her financial moves clash with the selfless Methodist credo to do good for others that she so often says guided her toward a life of public service.\par \par \uc2 But her longtime friends say the contradiction is rooted in Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's practicality and the boom-and-bust cycles that have characterized her life with \uc2 Bill \uc2 Clinton\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 At no time did those stresses fall more squarely on Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's shoulders than in the difficult two-year period in Arkansas when she and her husband found themselves cast out of office, financially strained and deeply uncertain about the future. And the memory of that time shaped her desire to be free from financial burden.\par \par \uc2 ''Hillary had a couple years of the taste of what it means to be a working mother, without any help, to have to take care of a small baby and care for your job,'' said \uc2 James B. Blair\uc2 , a close \uc2 Clinton\uc2  friend and lawyer who offered Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  investment advice in the 1970s.\par \par \uc2 The Clintons' unexpected ouster from their comfortable life occurred at a time when Arkansas was swirling with new money and get-rich-quick schemes as companies like Tyson and \uc2 Walmart\uc2  minted millionaires and new savings and loan institutions were spreading throughout the South.\par \par \uc2 A generation of Ivy League-educated young people like Mr. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  had returned to their home state to make their mark. Money seemed to be all around the Clintons, but they did not have much of their own. And unlike Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , a worrier by nature, Mr. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , consumed with his dreams of a political career, seemed indifferent to securing a financial future.\par \par \uc2 ''He was never interested in money, ever,'' Mr. Blair said. ''She is the one who had to be sure Chelsea was going to be able to afford college.''\par \par \uc2 People close to Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  don't begrudge her desire to provide generously for her family, and certainly many presidential candidates and public servants acquire vast personal wealth. Asked in an interview whether earlier financial stresses had prompted her to pursue the lucrative speechmaking, Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  said, ''I really think it's much simpler than that,'' adding that it is typical for secretaries of state to share their views in speeches after leaving office.\par \par \uc2 Thrift Store D\u233\'00\'E9cor\par \par \uc2 It was one of the smallest houses on the block in Little Rock's Hillcrest section, and Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  largely bought it with her own money, the month after that devastating 1980 \uc2 election\uc2  loss.\par \par \uc2 She filled the rooms with mismatched furniture bought at thrift stores and borrowed from her flamboyant mother-in-law. She converted the windowed attic into a bedroom for Chelsea, parked her Oldsmobile Cutlass in the weedy driveway and chased after the family's cocker spaniel, Zeke, who liked to chew through the fence.\par \par \uc2 The Clintons had stretched their finances to afford the $112,000 home, which was down the hill from the city's old-money mansions. The sprawling estate of Winthrop Rockefeller, the celebrated former governor, was so close that it practically cast a shadow on the Clintons' grassy backyard.\par \par \uc2 Friends described the d\u233\'00\'E9cor as unsightly, a jarring departure from the governor's mansion.\par \par \uc2 ''That couch just jumped out at me,'' said Bobby Roberts, a former aide to Mr. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , describing a scarlet-colored Victorian chaise that Mr. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's mother, Virginia Kelly, had lent them. ''It was in some bright, violent color.''\par \par \uc2 And with no parents or in-laws in Little Rock, Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  turned to friends and neighbors for help. She persuaded Carolyn Huber, who had helped run the governor's mansion while Mr. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  was in office, to continue to help care for Chelsea, who had grown fond of her.\par \par \uc2 A neighbor, Manuel J. Lozano, recalled: Hillary ''was running around, and my wife took care of Chelsea here and there whenever she needed help.''\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  had turned down out-of-state job offers in academia and Democratic politics, and instead took the only offer he had in Arkansas, to serve ''of counsel'' for $55,000 a year at the \uc2 Wright, Lindsey & Jennings\uc2  law firm, where Mr. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's longtime adviser Bruce R. Lindsey was a partner.\par \par \uc2 But he spent most of his time on the road, often accompanied by Mr. Lindsey, trying to win back the hearts of voters.\par \par \uc2 ''He had to go all over that state, touch base and apologize, and listen to why he lost,'' Mrs. Pietrafesa recalled, ''and every one of those visits was a two-, three- or four-hour ordeal.''\par \par \uc2 Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  had become a partner at the Rose Law Firm in 1979, and during these lean years, she balanced her work there with caring for Chelsea, who celebrated her first birthday and learned to walk in the Hillcrest house, on Midland Street. She often felt on her own as Mr. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  crisscrossed the state, friends said.\par \par \uc2 She increased her hours to bring in work for the firm, with business not as easy to come by now that she was no longer the governor's wife.\par \par \uc2 ''The whole time period was a point of learning, after the defeat,'' Jerry C. Jones, Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's colleague at the firm, remembered.\par \par \uc2 Friends said she would have focused on public service and charitable work and not gone to work at the firm -- a practice known for representing the business and political elite -- had she not been concerned about her family's finances. Ann Henry, an Arkansas friend, described Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  as an ''oddity'' there, where other women, mostly secretaries and paralegals, gawked at her curls and thrown-together clothes.\par \par \uc2 (Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  worked at the Rose Law Firm for roughly 15 years, the longest she has worked at any job, though it is not on her official campaign biography.)\par \par \uc2 ''I'm not sure she ever planned to be a corporate lawyer,'' said Lissa Muscatine, a friend and former chief speechwriter to Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 . But she did the work because ''she had the earning capacity that he didn't have as governor.''\par \par \uc2 A Frugal Father\par \par \uc2 Growing up in the upper-middle-class suburb of Park Ridge, Ill., Hillary Rodham -- whose mother had been raised in poverty and whose Depression-era father preached frugality -- babysat and held summer jobs beginning when she was 13. Her father, Hugh Rodham, taught his only daughter fiscal responsibility and how to read stock tables in the newspaper. But he was not one to shower his children with material things.\par \par \uc2 ''Her mother came from nothing and her father was self-made, so there's always been an awareness of working hard to earn a living,'' said Lisa Caputo, a friend and former White House aide.\par \par \uc2 There was anxiety, too. The family was never comfortably affluent, and even as Mr. Rodham bought himself a Cadillac, he insisted that his wife and children live modestly. Hillary and her brothers helped at his drapery business, which eventually closed after sales slowed.\par \par \uc2 By the time she was a student at \uc2 Wellesley College\uc2 , Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  and many in her generation were expressing skepticism about the pursuit of money. In her 1969 commencement speech, she denounced materialism and corporate greed. ''We're searching for more immediate, ecstatic and penetrating modes of living,'' she declared.\par \par \uc2 When she moved to Fayetteville, Ark., and later married Mr. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  in 1975, the Yale Law-educated couple lived happily earning about $18,000 a year each in their positions as professors. But several years later, as Mr. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  planned his run for the governor's office and the couple worried about starting a family, Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  grew increasingly uneasy about their incomes and started to think more seriously about how to build a nest egg.\par \par \uc2 ''She had been the chief breadwinner and financial decision maker,'' her best friend, Diane D. Blair, wrote in notes she kept about the era.\par \par \uc2 Arkansas was a small state with overlapping circles of the politically and economically powerful -- and many of the Clintons' contemporaries were getting rich. ''The smart guys who were politically active would make that interesting investment that would push them from the ranks of the upper middle class into the wealthy and powerful,'' said William K. Black, a former financial regulator and professor at the University of Missouri-Kansas City.\par \par \uc2 Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  began seeking out investment opportunities, and in 1978 she made one of the most lucrative, if seemingly risky, financial decisions of her life.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Blair, the Clintons' close friend, had made several million dollars in the commodities market, and urged Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  to begin trading, too. With an initial investment of just $1,000, she made nearly $100,000 trading cattle futures in a 10-month period, which helped pay for the down payment on the Midland Street home. But the move later haunted her when the investment became the subject of scrutiny in the early years of the \uc2 Clinton\uc2  presidency.\par \par \uc2 It still trails her occasionally: Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  raised it at a rally last month in North Carolina, as he attacked her for being ''crooked.'' ''Look at her cattle futures!'' he called out to the crowd.\par \par \uc2 Also in 1978, another friend, James B. McDougal, persuaded Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  to invest in another venture: the Whitewater real estate development on a plot of land in the Ozarks. The Clintons ultimately lost money on the deal, but the development led to an investigation when Mr. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  was in the White House.\par \par \uc2 The deals were certainly tempting, given the couple's income at the time. In 1978, Mr. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  became one of the youngest, and lowest paid, governors, in the country, earning $33,519.14 his first year in office. Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's income from the Rose Law Firm brought their combined wages in 1978 to $51,173.\par \par \uc2 Even though she reaped big rewards on the commodities market, the experience was unnerving. Shortly after Chelsea was born, Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  told her broker she wanted out. ''I couldn't take the stress,'' she said at a campaign stop in June.\par \par \uc2 She would, however, continue to shoulder her family's financial worries.\par \par \uc2 Not long after Mr. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  won re-\uc2 election\uc2  in 1982, the Clintons sold the yellow house on Midland Street and moved back into the governor's mansion, where they once again had free housing and the assistance of a small staff.\par \par \uc2 Two years later, the state increased the governor's term to four years, and the Clintons' finances appeared more stable. Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  went on to join the board of \uc2 Walmart\uc2 , and she continued to work at the Rose Law Firm. By the time Mr. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  was running for president, they reported $297,177 in total income on their 1992 tax returns, a sum that would put most Americans in the upper income tier but seemed meager compared with the wealth of his opponents, George Bush and \uc2 Ross Perot\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 ''When we moved into the White House, we had the lowest net worth of any family since Harry Truman,'' Mr. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  has said.\par \par \uc2 The White House years offered a respite from financial worry. As first lady, Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  wrote a book, ''It Takes a Village,'' for which she did not accept an advance and donated the proceeds to charity. ''HRC insists she will have time, wants it to have impact (of course, also wants it to make huge bucks),'' Mrs. Blair wrote at the time.\par \par \uc2 Still, the couple's earlier financial decisions resurfaced in damaging ways. What started as an investigation into the Whitewater investment spun into revelations of Mr. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's relationship with a White House intern, which led to the president's impeachment by the House of Representatives.\par \par \uc2 When the Clintons left the White House after the 2000 \uc2 election\uc2  -- the first time they were without the safety net of public office in 18 years -- they owed $5 million in legal fees and once again felt financial uncertainty. In 2014, Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  described her family's situation at the time in words that have bedeviled her candidacy: ''Dead broke.''\par \par \uc2 Once again, the Clintons needed a house, and once again they turned to the help of a wealthy friend. This time it was \uc2 Terry McAuliffe\uc2 , a longtime \uc2 Clinton\uc2  campaign fund-raiser, who offered to guarantee the mortgage on the home they would move into after leaving the White House.\par \par \uc2 But this time, the home -- a $1.7 million, 11-room Dutch Colonial in Chappaqua, a rich suburb -- was not one of the smallest houses on the block. Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  did not have to call the Roto-Rooter every time the old pipes clogged or run to a neighbor's house to borrow milk and eggs, as she had done in the house on Midland Street.\par \par \uc2 And now it was Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , eyeing a Senate seat from New York, who left her husband at home as she hit the road, crisscrossing the state for her campaign.\par \par \uc2 Find out what you need to know about the 2016 presidential race today, and get politics news updates via \uc2 Facebook\uc2 , \uc2 Twitter\uc2  and the First Draft newsletter.\par \par \uc2 Above, Hillary and Bill \uc2 Clinton\uc2  in 1980 with a newborn Chelsea in Little Rock, Ark.

\par\par \uc2 BOOKS OF THE TIMES\par \uc2 The Arts/Cultural Desk; SECTC\par \b \uc2 A Compassionate Analysis of the Poor Who Love \uc2 Trump\b0\par\par\uc2 By JENNIFER SENIOR \par \uc2 1,180 \uc2 words\par \uc2 11 August 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 1\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 In late July, The American Conservative ran an interview with J. D. Vance that drew so much traffic it briefly crippled the central nervous system of the magazine's website. The interviewer's last line implored readers to have a look at Mr. Vance's publishing debut, ''Hillbilly Elegy: A Memoir of a Family and Culture in Crisis.'' Ever since, his book has hovered at high altitude on Amazon, seldom dipping below No. 10.\par \par \uc2 After reading ''Hillbilly Elegy,'' you can easily understand why. This is a historically peculiar \uc2 election\uc2  cycle, boisterously disrupted by outsiders, one of whom found the perfect host body in the Republican Party and became its presidential nominee. An investigation of voter estrangement has never felt more urgent, and we're certainly not getting one from the lacquered chatterers on the boob tube.\par \par \uc2 Now, along comes Mr. Vance, offering a compassionate, discerning sociological analysis of the white underclass that has helped drive the politics of rebellion, particularly the ascent of Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2 . Combining thoughtful inquiry with firsthand experience, Mr. Vance has inadvertently provided a civilized reference guide for an uncivilized \uc2 election\uc2 , and he's done so in a vocabulary intelligible to both Democrats and Republicans.\par \par \uc2 Imagine that.\par \par \uc2 On the checklist of modern privilege, Mr. Vance, 31, has the top four in the bag: He is white, male, straight and Protestant.\par \par \uc2 But his profile is misleading. His people -- hillbillies, rednecks, white trash, choose your epithet (or term of affection, depending on your point of view) -- didn't step off the Mayflower and become part of America's ascendant class. ''Poverty is the family tradition,'' he writes. His ancestors and kin were sharecroppers, coal miners, machinists, millworkers -- all low-paying, body-wearying occupations that over the years have vanished or offered diminished security.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Vance was raised in Middletown, Ohio, a now-decaying steel town filled with Kentucky transplants, which at one point included his Mamaw and Papaw -- in newscaster English, that's grandma and grandpa -- who moved there shortly after World War II. Though the couple eventually managed to achieve the material comforts of a middle-class life (house, car), they brought their Appalachian values and habits with them. Some were wonderfully positive, like loyalty and love of country. But others, like a tendency toward violence and verbal abuse, were inimical to family life.\par \par \uc2 Papaw was forever coming home drunk. Mamaw, ''a violent nondrunk,'' was forever tormenting him, whether by serving him artfully arranged plates of garbage for dinner or dousing him with gasoline. All this guerrilla warfare affected their children. Mr. Vance's mother was an empress of instability -- violent, feckless, prone to hysteria. A long stint in rehab couldn't shake her addiction to prescription narcotics (she'd later move on to heroin). She spun through more boyfriends than this reader could count and at least five husbands.\par \par \uc2 The only reason Mr. Vance made it out in one piece is because his grandparents eventually reconciled, becoming his unofficial guardians. (He also spent a terrifically affirming four years in the Marines.) Mamaw was especially encouraging. She was tough as snakeskin, foul-mouthed as a mobster and filled with love. In a town where many children don't finish high school, she raised a grandson who managed to graduate from \uc2 Ohio State University\uc2  and Yale Law School, defying skyscraping odds.\par \par \uc2 ''Hillbilly Elegy,'' in my mind, divides into two components: the family stories Mr. Vance tells -- most of which are no doubt better experienced on the page than they were in real life -- and the questions he raises. Chief among them: How much should he hold his hillbilly kin responsible for their own misfortunes?\par \par \uc2 In Mr. Vance's estimation, the answer is: a lot. Economic insecurity, he's convinced, accounts for only a small part of his community's problems; the much larger issue is hillbilly culture itself. Though proud of it in many ways, he's also convinced that it ''increasingly encourages social decay instead of counteracting it.''\par \par \uc2 His frustration with the nonworking white poor is especially acute. He recalls being a cashier at a Middletown grocery store and watching resentfully as his neighbors, who had creatively gamed the welfare system, jabbered on their cellphones as they were going through the checkout line.\par \par \uc2 He could not afford a cellphone.\par \par \uc2 ''Political scientists have spent millions of words trying to explain how Appalachia and the South went from staunchly Democratic to staunchly Republican in less than a generation,'' Mr. Vance writes. He suspects those cellphones have a lot to do with it. ''I could never understand why our lives felt like a struggle while those living off of government largess enjoyed trinkets that I only dreamed about.''\par \par \uc2 Time and again, Mr. Vance preaches a message of tough love and personal responsibility. He has no patience with an old acquaintance who told him he quit his job because he hated waking up early, only to take to \uc2 Facebook\uc2  to blame the ''Obama economy.'' Or with a former co-worker at a tile warehouse who missed work once a week though his girlfriend was pregnant.\par \par \uc2 Squint, and you'll note the incendiary nature of Mr. Vance's argument. It's always treacherous business to blame a group for its own misfortunes. Certainly, an outsider cannot say what Mr. Vance is saying to his kin and kind. But he can -- just as President Obama can say to fellow African-Americans, ''brothers should pull up their pants,'' as he did on \uc2 MTV\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 The difference is that President Obama believes poverty, though it may have a cultural component, is largely a structural problem, one the government can play a large role in fixing. Mr. Vance, a conservative, takes a far dimmer view.\par \par \uc2 Whether you agree with Mr. Vance or not, you must admire him for his head-on confrontation with a taboo subject. And he frames his critique generously, stipulating that it isn't laziness that's destroying hillbilly culture but what the psychologist Martin Seligman calls ''learned helplessness'' -- the fatalistic belief, born of too much adversity, that nothing can be done to change your lot.\par \par \uc2 What he's really writing about is despair.\par \par \uc2 Never is Mr. Vance more aware of this pessimism and estrangement than when he leaves for \uc2 Ohio State University\uc2 . He's plumped with hope; his neighbors, left behind, feel its opposite.

\par\par \b \uc2 Home Buyer Shortage Threatens Recovery\b0\par\par\uc2 By Laura Kusisto   \par \uc2 981 \uc2 words\par \uc2 11 August 2016\par \uc2 The Wall Street Journal\par \uc2 J\par A1\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 The housing recovery that began in 2012 has lifted the overall market but left behind a broad swath of the middle class, threatening to create a generation of permanent renters and sowing economic anxiety and frustration for millions of Americans.\par \par \uc2 Home prices rose in 83% of the nation's 178 major real-estate markets in the second quarter, according to figures released Wednesday by the \uc2 National Association of Realtors\uc2 . Overall prices are now just 2% below the peak reached in July 2006, according to S&P \uc2 CoreLogic\uc2  Case-Shiller Indices.\par \par \uc2 But most of the price gains, economists said, stem from a lack of fresh supply rather than a surge of buyers. The pace of new home construction remains at levels typically associated with recessions, while the homeownership rate in the second quarter was at its lowest point since the Census Bureau began tracking quarterly data in 1965 and the share of first-time home purchases remains mired near three-decade lows.\par \par \uc2 The lopsided recovery has shut out millions of aspiring homeowners who have been forced to rent because of damaged credit, swelling student loans, tough credit standards and a dearth of affordable homes, economists said.\par \par \uc2 In all, some 200,000 to 300,000 fewer U.S. households are purchasing a new home each year than would during normal market conditions, estimates \uc2 Ken Rosen\uc2 , chairman of the Fisher Center of Real Estate and Urban Economics at the \uc2 University of California at Berkeley\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 "I don't think we are in a normal housing market," said Lawrence Yun, chief economist at the National Association of Realtors. "The losers are clearly the rising rental population that isn't able to participate in this housing equity appreciation. They are missing out on [a big] source of middle-class wealth."\par \par \uc2 Anxiety about missed economic opportunities is a key driver of the anti-incumbent anger on both sides of the political spectrum that has shaken up the 2016 \uc2 election\uc2  season, helping fuel the insurgent presidential campaigns of \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  and Bernie Sanders.\par \par \uc2 "You have these people who can't get housing, and it's turning into this rage," said Kevin Finkel, executive vice president at Philadelphia-based Resource Real Estate, which owns or manages 25,550 apartments around the U.S.\par \par \uc2 While economists expected the homeownership rate to begin edging up this year, the rate fell to a 51-year low of 62.9% in the second quarter from 63.4% in the same quarter last year.\par \par \uc2 The rate could fall to 58% or lower by 2050, according to a recent prediction by housing experts Arthur Acolin of the \uc2 University of Southern California\uc2 , Laurie Goodman of the Urban Institute and Susan Wachter of the \uc2 Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Long-term declines could erase gains made by middle-class Americans since World War II. Owning a home provides protection against rising rents and has been a key component of retirement saving and wealth creation.\par \par \uc2 "The default savings mechanism for American households has been homeownership," Ms. Wachter said. "Today we have historic lows for young households in terms of ownership so they're not getting on this path."\par \par \uc2 That can ripple throughout the economy. Homeowners often use home equity to pay for college tuition, vacations or home renovations, which help boost consumer spending. The mere knowledge that home values are rising can make consumers comfortable spending money other places, a process known as the wealth effect.\par \par \uc2 "We're seeing a divide between the wealth of homeowners and the wealth of renters," said Nela Richardson, chief economist at real-estate brokerage firm Redfin.\par \par \uc2 After peaking in July 2006, the Case-Shiller index plunged 27% over the next six years. Since then the recovery has been swift, particularly in markets with strong job growth and limited supply, creating problems for entry-level buyers in particular.\par \par \uc2 Across the country the recovery has been divided between strong West Coast markets and Texas, which have rebounded swiftly beyond their 2006 peaks, while prices from the Rust Belt to southern Florida may not return to those levels for decades.\par \par \uc2 Prices in the Boulder, Colo., metro area are 45% above their prior peak, while those in Dallas are 26% above their boom-time highs, according to data provider \uc2 CoreLogic Inc\uc2 . Meanwhile, prices in the Saginaw, Mich., area remain nearly 40% below their peak levels and those in Atlantic City are still 38% lower.\par \par \uc2 The main reason for falling homeownership, economists say: mortgage availability. Lenders chastened by the financial crisis -- which was fueled partly by home loans issued to borrowers ill-equipped to repay them -- have consequently been fearful of making loans to borrowers with dings on their credit, student debt or credit-card bills, or younger buyers with shorter credit histories.\par \par \uc2 "Right now our mortgage finance system is still not working well for lower- and middle-income households and first-time buyers," said Mr. Rosen.\par \par \uc2 A dearth of home construction, especially at the lower end, is taking a toll. Nationally, the inventory of homes for sale has dropped more than 37% since 2011, according to Zillow, a real estate information firm. Some of that reflects the clearing away of distressed inventory, but economists said the pendulum has swung toward a housing shortage.\par \par \uc2 An estimated 1 million new households were formed last year, but only 620,000 new housing units were built, according to the \uc2 Urban Institute\uc2 . An analysis of census data by the \uc2 Urban Institute\uc2  showed that all of the net new households formed between 2006 and 2014 were renters rather than owners.\par \par \uc2 "We went so many years without building there are in many places in the country a shortage of housing," said \uc2 Richard Green\uc2 , the Lusk Chair in Real Estate at the \uc2 University of Southern California\uc2 . "I think that overshadows everything else in terms of normalcy."\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=wjco20160811000104"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document J000000020160811ec8b0002o\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw272\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4080\pichgoal600

\par\par \b \uc2 Election\uc2  2016: Indiana Insider Upends Race for Senate Seat\b0\par\par\uc2 By Kristina Peterson   \par \uc2 773 \uc2 words\par \uc2 11 August 2016\par \uc2 The Wall Street Journal\par \uc2 J\par A4\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 INDIANAPOLIS -- Across the country, voters are expressing disdain this year for Washington and the political operatives who work there. But in Indiana, that may not apply to \uc2 Evan Bayh\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2 's derision of longtime politicians may have helped him secure the GOP presidential nomination, and Bernie Sanders's outsider appeal gave him unexpected strength in the Democratic contest. But Mr. Bayh, the Democratic candidate for Indiana's open Senate seat, appears to be helped by his political lineage and years of experience. A race that looked like a cakewalk for Republicans has significantly tightened since Mr. Bayh entered the contest last month.\par \par \uc2 The son of a popular former U.S. senator, Mr. Bayh served two terms as Indiana's governor and 12 years in the \uc2 U.S. Senate\uc2 , making him a familiar presence to Hoosiers long before he announced in mid-July he would challenge GOP Rep. Todd Young for the state's open Senate seat.\par \par \uc2 "I would vote for him. Is he a Republican or a Democrat?" asked Lawrence Mykytiuk, a Lafayette resident and associate professor of library science at Purdue University, who said he tilts more Democratic. "I trust the name."\par \par \uc2 Republicans are hoping Mr. Bayh's decades of experience and family history will become a political liability.\par \par \uc2 But Mr. Bayh's candidacy transformed the sleepy race into one of the closest Senate contests in the fight for control of the chamber expected to come down to the wire in November. Two nonpartisan political analysts changed their rating of the race to a "tossup" from one favoring Republicans. Democrats need five seats to take back the Senate majority, or four if they win the White House.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Young was widely expected to beat former Democratic Rep. Baron Hill in November to replace retiring GOP Sen. Dan Coats.\par \par \uc2 But Mr. Hill bowed out of the race in July after \uc2 Sen. Charles Schumer\uc2  (D., N.Y.) helped convince the better-known and better-funded Mr. Bayh to run. He had almost $9.5 million in cash on hand at the end of June, according to \uc2 Federal \uc2 Election\uc2  Commission\uc2  filings, compared with $1.2 million for Mr. Young.\par \par \uc2 The Bayh name still stokes positive memories for voters across the political spectrum. His father, Birch Bayh, spent 18 years in the Senate and served as speaker of the state House before that.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Young has taken aim at both Mr. Bayh's family dynasty and his time spent in Washington in campaign attacks, echoing those that sank Sen. Richard Lugar in the 2012 GOP primary.\par \par \uc2 "I'm not running on my dad's name, I'm running on my dad's values," Mr. Young said at a campaign event in Lafayette recently.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Bayh says his name has resonance at home because of his time spent in office. "It's not just my name -- it's my record of serving the people of the state of Indiana," he said in an interview.\par \par \uc2 Republicans also have highlighted Mr. Bayh's work at the Washington office of law and lobbying firm \uc2 McGuireWoods LLP\uc2 , and his residences in Washington to argue he has become disconnected with Indiana. Mr. Bayh owns a condo in Indianapolis, two houses in Washington, D.C., and a condo in Florida, according to his campaign.\par \par \uc2 Many voters said Mr. Bayh's time in Washington didn't bother them and that his two terms as governor left him with a good feel for the state's political dynamics.\par \par \uc2 "Once you're a Hoosier, you're always a Hoosier," said Lafayette resident and Democrat Ed Austin, who said he viewed political experience as an asset. "I'm a plumber and a pipe fitter -- you wouldn't want me to come over and decorate your house, now would you?"\par \par \uc2 Outside groups are expected to ramp up their spending in the race, with Republicans planning to highlight the more liberal-leaning parts of Mr. Bayh's record, including his support for the 2010 health-care law, a GOP strategist said.\par \par \uc2 Both Messrs. Bayh and Young are closer to the political center than many lawmakers in Congress. But as a Republican running in a GOP-leaning state, Mr. Young's policy stances drew praise from some GOP voters in Indiana, who said they want to see fewer federal regulations and expanded foreign trade.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Bayh released an ad last week promising to "get tough on trade," while Mr. Young has emphasized that in concept he remains "unambiguously for opening up foreign markets [and] reducing foreign barriers to trade."\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=wjco20160811000097"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document J000000020160811ec8b0002h\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw272\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4080\pichgoal600

\par\par \b \uc2 Election\uc2  2016: Candidates Target Vulnerabilities\b0\par\par\uc2 By Beth Reinhard and Peter Nicholas   \par \uc2 794 \uc2 words\par \uc2 11 August 2016\par \uc2 The Wall Street Journal\par \uc2 J\par A4\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 ABINGDON, Va. -- \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  and \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  targeted each other's political vulnerabilities Wednesday, with the GOP presidential nominee questioning his Democratic rival's ethics and honesty while Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  stoked doubts about his unpredictability.\par \par \uc2 In Virginia, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  accused Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's inner circle of engaging in a "pay for play" way of doing business, citing emails released Tuesday that showed top \uc2 Clinton\uc2  Foundation\uc2  officials seeking access to the State Department for major foundation donors while she was secretary of state. "It's called pay for play and some of these were really, really bad and illegal," he said.\par \par \uc2 At a campaign stop in Iowa, Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  harked back to remarks Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  made Tuesday about "Second Amendment people" that critics said could be interpreted as inviting gun owners to commit violence against her.\par \par \uc2 She condemned Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  for "his casual inciting of violence" and said, "\uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  simply doesn't have the temperament to be president and commander in chief of the United States."\par \par \uc2 Both attacks fit into the rivals' campaign playbooks and are in tune with weaknesses exposed by polling.\par \par \uc2 The latest Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll found deep voter concerns about Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's temperament, with only 16% of registered voters ranking him as having the right temperament to be president and just 23% saying he was knowledgeable and experienced enough to handle the presidency.\par \par \uc2 Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's soft spot is on the issue of trust -- only 22% of those surveyed viewed her as being honest and straightforward, while 56% rated her poorly on those qualities.\par \par \uc2 On Tuesday, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  set off a firestorm when he referred to Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's potential to nominate Supreme Court justices with antigun leanings and said,"If she gets to pick her judges, nothing you can do folks. Although the Second Amendment people -- maybe there is, I don't know."\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 Clinton\uc2  campaign and others lodged loud objections that his comments could be interpreted as a call for violent action. One of the main differences between herself and Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , she said, is that he doesn't appreciate that loose rhetoric "can have tremendous consequences."\par \par \uc2 "Words matter, my friends," she said. "And if you are running to be president or you are president of the United States, words can have tremendous consequences. Yesterday we witnessed the latest in a long line of casual comments from \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  that cross the line," Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  said.\par \par \uc2 Trump\uc2  allies said he was urging them to flex their political muscle, and that his words were misinterpreted by Democrats to create a controversy.\par \par \uc2 The New York businessman didn't directly bring up the flap but seemed to refer to it at Wednesday's rally, saying the media "can take a little story that isn't a story and make it into a big deal," before pivoting to a call to protect the Second Amendment's right to bear arms.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  focused greater attention on another Tuesday event: the release of 296 pages of emails from Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's personal server, including many that weren't handed over to the government as part of the Democratic nominee's archive. The documents were obtained by \uc2 Judicial Watch\uc2 , a conservative group, through a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit.\par \par \uc2 In one exchange, a \uc2 Clinton\uc2  Foundation\uc2  official asked top aides to Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  to set up a meeting between a State Department official and Gilbert Chagoury, who donated between $1 million and $5 million to the foundation, according to its disclosures.\par \par \uc2 "We need Gilbert Chagoury to speak to the substance person re Lebanon," Doug Band, a \uc2 Bill \uc2 Clinton\uc2  aide who helped launch the foundation, wrote in April 2009. "As you know, he's key guy there and to us and is loved in Lebanon. Very imp."\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 Clinton\uc2  campaign said in a statement that the emails in the exchange don't "involve the secretary or relate to the foundation's work. They are communications between her aides and the president's personal aide. . ."\par \par \uc2 A campaign spokesman added that Mr. Chagoury had been seeking to offer the State Department his insights on the Lebanese \uc2 election\uc2 , rather than looking to elicit any official action.\par \par \uc2 As Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  addressed some 1,650 people at the Iowa rally, she got a rare scare.\par \par \uc2 An animal-rights activist jumped a metal barrier and started toward the stage where Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  was speaking. The activist was wrestled to the ground and several Secret Service agents protectively rushed toward Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 . The candidate seemed unfazed and continued speaking. A spokeswoman for a group called Direct Action Everywhere said the protester's intent was to draw attention to abuse of animals.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=wjco20160811000096"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document J000000020160811ec8b0002g\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw272\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4080\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 ON THE GROUND\par \par \uc2 Clinton\uc2  Campaign\par \par \uc2 Draws GOP Backers\par \par \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's campaign is now working to create state-based groups of Republicans backing her for president, an expansion of the national organization announced Wednesday, a senior campaign official said.\par \par \uc2 "Ultimately what we intend to do is take it to the state level, to battleground states," Campaign chairman \uc2 John Podesta\uc2  said in an interview. He said the campaign will be hunting GOP leaders who believe the Democratic nominee is "the right choice," while Republican \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  is "unfit and a risky choice."\par \par \uc2 The goal is to capitalize on growing unease with Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , particularly among national-security experts and business leaders. The new group, called Together for America, includes nearly 50 people and is dominated by people who have retired from active politics. It also includes a number of business leaders, including several who had already made their support for Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  known.\par \par \uc2 New endorsements announced Wednesday include former Commerce Secretary \uc2 Carlos Gutierrez\uc2 , former Housing and Urban Development Secretary \uc2 Carla Hills\uc2 , former Rep. Connie Morella (R., Md.), former Rep. Chris Shays (R., Conn.), and former Director of National Intelligence John Negroponte.\par \par \uc2 -- Laura Meckler\par \par \uc2 ---\par \par \uc2 HOUSE CONTROL\par \par \uc2 Rep. Becerra Sees\par \par \uc2 Democratic Opening\par \par \uc2 Rep. Xavier Becerra (D., Calif.), who has been crisscrossing the country to help support Democratic challengers, predicted Democrats will win the 30 seats needed to regain control of the House if Republican \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  continues to stumble.\par \par \uc2 "If this is a change \uc2 election\uc2 , the sky's the limit," Mr. Becerra said in an interview. "We can get to our 30 for sure."\par \par \uc2 The Democratic Conference chair, who occupies a safe Los Angeles seat, traveled to the western suburbs of Minneapolis, where he joined state Sen. Terri Bonoff for several campaign events in her uphill bid to unseat Republican Rep. Erik Paulsen.\par \par \uc2 Ms. Bonoff is perhaps the highest-profile example of a "\uc2 Trump\uc2  recruit" -- a Democratic candidate who decided to join a congressional contest late this year, after Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's nomination became all but certain. She declared her candidacy on April 7, not leaving much time to build name recognition or a fundraising haul.\par \par \uc2 -- Michelle Hackman\par \par \uc2 ---\par \par \uc2 WHITE HOUSE\par \par \uc2 Social Media Notes\par \par \uc2 The White House said Americans will now be able to send President \uc2 Barack Obama\uc2  messages through the social-networking site \uc2 Facebook\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 The White House has long accepted letters, emails and faxes to the president from Americans. \uc2 Mr. Obama\uc2  has said that he reads 10 of those messages each evening. Now, the White House will accept messages online using the Facebook Messenger platform.\par \par \uc2 -- Byron Tau\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=wjco20160811000095"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document J000000020160811ec8b0002f\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw272\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4080\pichgoal600

\par\par \b \uc2 Election\uc2  2016: Ex-Chair Of DNC Is Tested In Florida Primary\b0\par\par\uc2 By Julian Routh   \par \uc2 410 \uc2 words\par \uc2 11 August 2016\par \uc2 The Wall Street Journal\par \uc2 J\par A4\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 HOLLYWOOD, Fla. -- Greg Shesney had a campaign sign for \uc2 Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz\uc2  on his front lawn through most of July, broadcasting his preferred candidate in the coming House Democratic primary.\par \par \uc2 His sign now sits in his shed, taken down last week after Ms. Wasserman Schultz was forced to resign as Democratic National Committee chairwoman amid charges that the \uc2 DNC\uc2  sought to undercut the presidential primary campaign of Bernie Sanders against \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 "She seemed to have crossed the line with what she did at the \uc2 DNC\uc2 ," said Mr. Shesney, who is reconsidering his vote.\par \par \uc2 Until this year, Ms. Wasserman Schultz hadn't had a primary challenger in this district in the Miami suburbs. Now, she is facing Tim Canova, a 56-year-old law professor who entered the Aug. 30 contest because he saw how Mr. Sanders's message was resonating.\par \par \uc2 Stoked by an endorsement from Mr. Sanders, Mr. Canova outraised the incumbent by more than $400,000 last quarter. Mr. Canova pulled in about $2.2 million from his January campaign launch toJune 30. He said he raised an additional $1 million in July.\par \par \uc2 Still, Ms. Wasserman Schultz raised $2.7 million through June, and her work in the district and name recognition should carry her to a primary win, analysts say.\par \par \uc2 In a phone interview last week, Ms. Wasserman Schultz acknowledged "mistakes" at the \uc2 DNC\uc2 , and condemned a particular email exchange by her staffers, released on the website \uc2 WikiLeaks\uc2 , that questioned Mr. Sanders's faith.\par \par \uc2 But she ultimately defended the \uc2 DNC\uc2 's handling of the presidential contest. "I am proud of the work we did to run our primary nominating contest according to the rules," Ms. Wasserman Schultz said.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Canova is echoing Mr. Sanders's campaign themes: railing against corporate money in politics and trumpeting his small individual contributions. He is also attacking the incumbent for spending too much time in Washington.\par \par \uc2 "I've probably spent a hell of a lot more time in this district the last few years than she has," he said.\par \par \uc2 Ms. Wasserman Schultz's campaign noted the more than 70 in-district events she has held since last November. "She's always been so engaged," said former Florida Democratic \uc2 Rep. Ron Klein\uc2 . "I think it pays dividends that people know who you are and that you've been around."\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=wjco20160811000094"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document J000000020160811ec8b0002e\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw272\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4080\pichgoal600

\par\par \b \uc2 Election\uc2  2016: What Links \uc2 Trump\uc2  Economy Team --- Nine of nominee's 14 advisers are known for audacious bets in real estate, finance\b0\par\par\uc2 By Anupreeta Das   \par \uc2 808 \uc2 words\par \uc2 11 August 2016\par \uc2 The Wall Street Journal\par \uc2 J\par A5\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 A group of high-profile investors who got rich buying up distressed assets have found their latest turnaround project: \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2 's campaign.\par \par \uc2 The Republican presidential nominee last week announced his team of economic advisers, calling the 14 men a "formidable group of experienced and talented individuals." The group, including nine drawn from real estate and finance, will help shape Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's policies on trade, jobs, regulation and taxes.\par \par \uc2 Those nine are united by more than their wealth. On Wall Street, they are outsiders, known for audacious bets and, sometimes, spectacular flameouts. Five of them are among Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's biggest donors, contributing a total of $1.7 million in recent months to his campaign's joint fundraising efforts with the Republican Party.\par \par \uc2 The campaign, trailing in the polls and criticized for naming only men to the economics team, is preparing to disclose the names of as many as 10 additional economic advisers in the next couple of days, including some "very prominent" women, according to \uc2 Steven Mnuchin\uc2 , Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's national finance chairman. Mr. Mnuchin wouldn't identify the new advisers.\par \par \uc2 "The whole intent is to have a combination of people with real-life business experience and economic experience, or specific areas of expertise in the scholarly world," said Mr. Mnuchin, who is also one of the economic advisers.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's team includes some of the country's wealthiest self-made men, whose collective net worth is in the tens of billions of dollars. The roster was swiftly criticized by opponents, who not only noted that it was all male but that it contained barely any prominent economists.\par \par \uc2 The team's input helped shape Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's economic policy speech Monday in Detroit, which in part was meant to help refocus the struggling campaign on core policy issues. Democratic nominee \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  mocked the speech as written by "hedge fund guys, billionaire guys" and "six guys named Steve."\par \par \uc2 "The helpfulness of the team comes from their outside-of-the-system perspectives and positions," said \uc2 Thomas Barrack\uc2 , founder and executive chairman of Colony Capital Inc., a Los Angeles-based private equity and real-estate firm.\par \par \uc2 Six individuals on the \uc2 Trump\uc2  economics team, including Mr. Barrack, have at times pursued "distressed investing," going after assets such as soured mortgages or the debt of struggling companies. When companies restructure their balance sheets, distressed investors can make a neat profit. But the strategy is risky, and is confined to a corner of the finance world.\par \par \uc2 Investor \uc2 Wilbur Ross\uc2  said Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  and \uc2 Paul Manafort\uc2 , the campaign's manager, asked him to help formulate trade policy, owing to his long experience as a distressed investor in industries affected by imports and exports, from cars to textiles.\par \par \uc2 Despite some high-profile advisers, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's campaign hasn't won backing from the hundreds of hedge-fund managers, private-equity executives, investment bankers and other money managers who rallied behind \uc2 Mitt Romney\uc2  when he was the 2012 GOP nominee. This \uc2 election\uc2 , hedge-fund managers and others have given millions to pro-\uc2 Clinton\uc2  groups.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  has made inroads since hiring Mr. Mnuchin, a former Goldman Sachs Group Inc. banker, as finance chairman in May. A fundraising agreement with the \uc2 Republican National Committee\uc2  has opened some Wall Street wallets.\par \par \uc2 Activist investor \uc2 Nelson Peltz\uc2  of \uc2 Trian Fund Management LP\uc2  recently gave $50,000 to the joint fund, for example, federal records show. After Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's public spat with the parents of a Muslim U.S. Army captain killed in Iraq, Mr. Peltz also gave $50,000 to the \uc2 Democratic National Committee\uc2 , said a person familiar with the matter.\par \par \uc2 One sign of the overlapping interests of his advisers: a number have done business with each other. In 2009, Mr. Mnuchin and \uc2 John Paulson\uc2 , founder of $13 billion hedge fund \uc2 Paulson & Co\uc2 ., were part of an investment group that bought the assets of IndyMac, a failed lender. The group sold the firm, renamed \uc2 OneWest Bank\uc2 , to \uc2 CIT Group Inc\uc2 . for $3.4 billion, making a more-than-threefold return on their initial investment.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Paulson declined to comment through a spokesman.\par \par \uc2 Perhaps the most surprising member of Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's team is Stephen Feinberg, the reclusive co-founder of private-equity firm Cerberus Capital Management LP, who hasn't been an active participant in politics.\par \par \uc2 Cerberus became well known for buying \uc2 Chrysler\uc2  in 2007, only to have its equity wiped out in the auto maker's bankruptcy. Cerberus later recouped some of its investment through the sale of \uc2 Chrysler\uc2 's lending unit -- thanks in part to the Obama administration's bailout of the auto industry.\par \par \uc2 ---\par \par \uc2 Sharon Terlep contributed to this article.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=wjco20160811000092"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document J000000020160811ec8b0002c\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw272\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4080\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 When the existence of \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's private email server was revealed last year, she should have recalled Mark Twain's quip: "If you tell the truth, you don't have to remember anything." That might have kept her from the lies that have now become numerous, convoluted and damaging.\par \par \uc2 Take her July 31 appearance on Fox News Sunday. Host Chris Wallace showed video of her saying: "I did not email any classified material to anyone," "I never sent nor received any information that was classified at the time," and "I had not sent classified material nor received anything marked classified."\par \par \uc2 But Mr. Wallace noted, "After a long investigation, FBI Director James Comey said none of those things that you told the American public were true." Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  replied, "That's not what I heard Director Comey say, and I thank you for giving me the opportunity to, in my view, clarify."\par \par \uc2 When a politician thanks her interrogator for an incriminating question, an evasion will likely follow. So it was here: "Director Comey said that my answers were truthful," Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  claimed. That grossly mischaracterized Mr. Comey's remarks, as numerous fact-checkers attested.\par \par \uc2 Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  was forced into a further clarification days later in an exchange with black and Hispanic journalists. What she had been pointing out, she claimed, was that "Director Comey had said that my answers in my \uc2 FBI\uc2  interview were truthful." Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  admitted that she "may have short-circuited" in her interview with Mr. Wallace, but added: "I think Chris Wallace and I were probably talking past each other, because of course, he could only talk to what I had told the \uc2 FBI\uc2  and I appreciated that."\par \par \uc2 Come again? This last gobbledygook shows that it isn't only the initial lie, but also the subsequent fibs that corrode a politician's reputation for honesty.\par \par \uc2 After further reading it is clear that the "he" -- the person who could only speak to what she had told the \uc2 FBI\uc2  -- refers not to Mr. Wallace but to Mr. Comey. Then Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  insisted that what she told the \uc2 FBI\uc2  "was consistent with what I had said publicly."\par \par \uc2 However, Mr. Comey never vouched for that. And if Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  did in fact tell the \uc2 FBI\uc2  what she had said publicly before, then she possibly could be charged with making a false statement. That's why it's hard to believe that she didn't change her story when the \uc2 FBI\uc2  had her in the hot seat.\par \par \uc2 The way to find out is for the \uc2 FBI\uc2  to release the contents of its investigation. One might hope that the \uc2 FBI\uc2  would have a transcript of its July 2 interview of Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 . But in his testimony to Congress the following week, Mr. Comey admitted that the agency neither put her under oath nor had a stenographer present.\par \par \uc2 FBI\uc2  agents involved in such interviews customarily prepare a list of questions. One agent poses them, while the remaining agents take notes that are used to draft a "Report of Interview," commonly called by its document number, "the 302."\par \par \uc2 To prove that she told Americans in public the same things she told the \uc2 FBI\uc2  in private, as she claims, Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  should ask Mr. Comey to release the agency's list of prepared questions and the 302 from her interview. Only then might voters have the information to decide for themselves whether Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  is being truthful or layering one lie on another.\par \par \uc2 These documents would also help resolve another question: What advice did Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  receive regarding her home-brew email server? "I relied on and had every reason to rely on the judgments of the professionals with whom I worked," she said on Fox News. "In retrospect, maybe some people are saying, well, among those 300 people, they made the wrong call." So did she tell the \uc2 FBI\uc2  who these unnamed professionals were and what they advised on the server? Or is this only another deception?\par \par \uc2 It's always the same with Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  -- from her cattle-futures trading in the 1970s; to Travelgate and the missing Rose Law Firm files in the 1990s; to Benghazi and the email server today. She misleads to cover up mistakes. The late New York Times columnist William Safire labeled her a "congenital liar" in 1996. "Drip by drip," he wrote, "the case is being made that she is compelled to mislead, and to ensnare her subordinates and friends in a web of deceit."\par \par \uc2 Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's corrupt character remains her main vulnerability in this \uc2 election\uc2 . If she hopes to earn Americans' confidence, she should demand that the \uc2 FBI\uc2  release its list of questions and her interview's 302.\par \par \uc2 ---\par \par \uc2 Mr. Rove helped organize the political-action committee American Crossroads and is the author of "The Triumph of William McKinley" (\uc2 Simon & Schuster\uc2 , 2015).\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=wjco20160811000027"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document J000000020160811ec8b0000q\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw272\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4080\pichgoal600

\par\par \b \uc2 Trump\uc2  and Taxes: Don't Look Behind the Curtain\b0\par\par\uc2 By Alan S. Blinder   \par \uc2 883 \uc2 words\par \uc2 10 August 2016\par \uc2 The Wall Street Journal\par \uc2 J\par A11\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 Tax cuts, especially tax cuts heavily skewed toward the rich, have been a staple of Republican presidential politics since Ronald Reagan. They still are, even in this wackiest of political seasons, although \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2 's proposal is a moving target.\par \par \uc2 As recently as the GOP convention, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  was still bragging that "I have proposed the largest tax reduction of any candidate who has declared for the presidential race." But on Monday, that tax plan disappeared from his website, and he sketched a new plan which, his advisers claimed, would cost about one-quarter to one-third as much as his old plan. Really? Stand by for further tweets.\par \par \uc2 This week's \uc2 Trump\uc2  plan cuts the top income-tax bracket rates to just 33% for personal taxes and 15% for corporate taxes. Not even the Chamber of Commerce seeks a corporate tax rate that low. And just for fun -- fun for the super-rich, that is -- he'd abolish all estate and gift taxes.\par \par \uc2 Though details are sorely lacking, \uc2 Trump\uc2  II resembles the House Republican plan. But here's one key difference. The House plan sets the tax rate on pass-through business income at 25%, thereby opening up a modest 8-point tax loophole (33% minus 25%) for wealthy business owners. \uc2 Trump\uc2  II makes the corresponding tax gap a whopping 18 points (33% minus 15%), thereby opening up a loophole wide enough to drive the whole \uc2 Trump\uc2  Organization\uc2  through.\par \par \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  opposes the \uc2 Trump\uc2  plan, of course, both for the revenue losses we can ill afford and because inequality is bad enough already. She proposes, instead, to increase taxes on the rich (incomes over $2 million a year) and the very rich (over $5 million). The \uc2 Tax Policy Center\uc2  estimates that her plan would raise about $1.1 trillion over 10 years, which is enough to pay for her proposed programs without blowing a hole in the budget. Nearly all the new revenue comes from the top 1%.\par \par \uc2 So there's quite a difference. This aspect of the 2016 tax debate has a familiar ring. Ronald Reagan and \uc2 Jimmy Carter\uc2  would recognize it. So would \uc2 Mitt Romney\uc2  and Barack Obama.\par \par \uc2 But a second tax debate is novel. It's the outcry over Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's imperious refusal to release his tax returns -- something no candidate, Republican or Democrat, has done in the last 40 years. In stark contrast, Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  has released her tax returns dating all the way back to 1977. But Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  won't budge, telling ABC's George Stephanopoulos, for example, that his tax rate is "none of your business."\par \par \uc2 Well, maybe it's none of Mr. Stephanopoulos's business. But it is the public's business -- for a number of good reasons including concerns about Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's alleged Russian connections and letting voters make judgments about actual and potential conflicts of interest. Do Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  or his business partners owe anything to Russian oligarchs? How much would Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  and his family save if the \uc2 Trump\uc2  tax plan became law?\par \par \uc2 Here's about all we know about The Donald's tax returns:\par \par \uc2 -- He says he's under \uc2 IRS\uc2  audit for returns since 2009, which he won't release until the audits are complete. Have you ever waited for a reply from the \uc2 IRS\uc2 , even for a relatively simple matter? Can you imagine how complex Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's tax returns must be? Do you think there's any chance the audits will be complete by \uc2 Election\uc2  Day?\par \par \uc2 -- The \uc2 IRS\uc2  does not object to anyone releasing his tax information while under audit. To prove the point, \uc2 Warren Buffett\uc2  recently offered to do so -- if \uc2 Trump\uc2  will.\par \par \uc2 -- Audits of Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's returns prior to 2009 are history, yet he also refuses to release those.\par \par \uc2 -- The last \uc2 Trump\uc2  tax returns to see the light of day, for 1978 and 1979, show he paid no taxes. They were unearthed by David Cay Johnston, the intrepid Pulitzer-prize-winning journalist, from filings with New Jersey casino regulators. According to a June report in \uc2 Politico\uc2 , also based on casino regulatory matters, the same was true of Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's 1991 and 1993 returns. After that, the lights go out.\par \par \uc2 -- The Donald claims to have given away millions to a host of charities. But after strenuous efforts, Washington Post reporter David Fahrenthold could document only one personal charitable donation since 2008 -- of between $5,000 and $10,000.\par \par \uc2 All this leaves the impression that Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  is hiding behind the audit excuse because he doesn't want voters to know that he pays no income taxes, or that he lies about his charitable donations, or that he's on the hook to oligarchs tied to \uc2 Vladimir Putin\uc2 . Perhaps all three.\par \par \uc2 These are just guesses, however. They could all be wrong. There is only one way to find out: Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , take down that wall.\par \par \uc2 ---\par \par \uc2 Mr. Blinder, a professor of economics and public affairs at Princeton University and former vice chairman of the Federal Reserve, is an informal policy adviser to the \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  campaign.\par \par \uc2 (See related letters: "Letters to the Editor: A Responsible Candidate Would Hand Over Returns" -- WSJ Aug. 18, 2016)\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.djreprints.com/link/DJRFactiva.html?FACTIVA=wjco20160810000037"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service}}}\par \par \uc2 Document J000000020160810ec8a0000u\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 CORRECTION APPENDEDWILMINGTON, N.C. -- \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2  on Tuesday appeared to raise the possibility that gun rights supporters could take matters into their own hands if \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  is elected president and appoints judges who favor stricter gun control measures.\par \par \uc2 Repeating his contention that Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  wanted to abolish the right to bear arms, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  warned at a rally here that it would be ''a horrible day'' if Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  were elected and got to appoint a tiebreaking Supreme Court justice.\par \par \uc2 ''If she gets to pick her judges, nothing you can do, folks,'' Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  said, as the crowd began to boo. He quickly added: ''Although the Second Amendment people -- maybe there is, I don't know.''\par \par \uc2 Oblique as it was, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's remark quickly elicited a wave of condemnation from Democrats, gun control advocates and others, who accused him of suggesting violence against Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  or liberal jurists. Bernice A. King, daughter of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., called Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's words ''distasteful, disturbing, dangerous.''\par \par \uc2 Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 's running mate, Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia, expressed disbelief. ''Nobody who is seeking a leadership position, especially the presidency, the leadership of the country, should do anything to countenance violence, and that's what he was saying,'' Mr. Kaine said in Austin, Tex. He called Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's remark ''a window into the soul of a person who is just temperamentally not suited to the task.''\par \par \uc2 And Dan Gross, the president of the Brady Campaign and Center to Prevent Gun Violence, which has endorsed Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , said Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's statement was ''repulsive -- literally using the Second Amendment as cover to encourage people to kill someone with whom they disagree.''\par \par \uc2 ''For \uc2 Trump\uc2 , violence has become a standard talking point, a common punch line, and even a campaign strategy,'' Mr. Gross said.\par \par \uc2 Paul D. Ryan, the Republican House speaker who has had a tense relationship with Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , told reporters on Tuesday night that the remarks sounded ''like a joke gone bad.''\par \par \uc2 He added: ''You should never joke about that. I hope he clears it up quickly.''\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  and his campaign did not treat his remark as a joke; instead, they insisted he was merely urging gun rights supporters to vote as a bloc against Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 . ''The Second Amendment people have tremendous power because they are so united,'' he told a \uc2 CBS\uc2  affiliate in North Carolina late Tuesday.\par \par \uc2 In an interview with Fox News, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  grew adamant. ''There can be no other interpretation,'' he said, adding, ''I mean, give me a break.''\par \par \uc2 But at his rally earlier in the day, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  had actually been discussing what could happen once Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  was president, not before the \uc2 election\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 And even many in the audience seemed caught by surprise. Video showed a man just over Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's shoulder go slack-jawed and turn to his companion, apparently in disbelief, when Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  made the remark.\par \par \uc2 Guy behind \uc2 Trump\uc2  immediately realized what he said was a problem. {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://t.co/F3mSP9GLqt"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 https://t.co/F3mSP9GLqt}}}\uc2  -- Chris Vannini (@ChrisVannini) August 9, 2016\par \par \uc2 The uproar over Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's off-the-cuff remark came as his campaign has been faced with a series of public opinion surveys showing him quickly losing ground to Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , and just a day after his campaign called his delivery of a prepared economic speech in Detroit, evidence of a newfound political discipline.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's fellow opponents of gun control stood by him, focusing on his depiction of Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  as a threat to the Second Amendment.\par \par \uc2 ''\uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  is absolutely correct,'' said Jennifer Baker, a strategist for the \uc2 National Rifle Association\uc2 . ''If \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  is elected, there is nothing we can do to stop her from nominating an anti-gun Supreme Court justice who will vote to overturn the individual right of law-abiding citizens to own a gun in their home for protection.''\par \par \uc2 The association also began running a new commercial characterizing Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  as ''one of the wealthiest women in politics'' and calling her a hypocrite for favoring gun restrictions while having been ''protected by armed guards for 30 years.'' Her gun policies, the ad says, would leave ordinary people ''defenseless.''\par \par \uc2 Veiled references to gun violence have tripped up candidates before. In 2010, Sharron Angle, a Nevada Republican challenging the Senate majority leader at the time, Harry Reid, severely damaged her unsuccessful candidacy while discussing the importance of the Second Amendment. ''When you read that Constitution and the founding fathers, they intended this to stop tyranny,'' she said, adding: ''It's to defend ourselves. And you know, I'm hoping that we're not getting to Second Amendment remedies. I hope the vote will be the cure for the Harry Reid problems.''\par \par \uc2 Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  herself learned the hard way: In June 2008, shortly before she conceded defeat in her Democratic primary contest with \uc2 Barack Obama\uc2 , she defended her perseverance in a way that critics said alluded to the possibility that Mr. Obama could be gunned down. ''We all remember Bobby Kennedy was assassinated in June in California,'' Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  said. She apologized hours later.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  did not repeat his violent insinuation at a later event in Fayetteville, N.C.\par \par \uc2 But Senator Chris Murphy, Democrat of Connecticut, who has championed gun control since the Sandy Hook mass shooting in his state, called Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's remarks ''disgusting and embarrassing and sad.''\par \par \uc2 ''This isn't play,'' Mr. Murphy wrote. ''Unstable people with powerful guns and an unhinged hatred for Hillary are listening to you, @realDonaldTrump.''\par \par \uc2 The condemnation from Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's critics across the political spectrum was deep. On \uc2 Twitter\uc2 , the conservative writer John Podhoretz, in a series of posts, wrote that Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  had implied that all Second Amendment supporters were ''potential assassins.'' He added that a president's words ''CANNOT MEAN NOTHING. They are the most important words spoken in the world.''\par \par \uc2 And Representative Eric Swalwell, Democrat of California, wrote on \uc2 Twitter\uc2  that the Secret Service should investigate Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  for making a death threat against Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 : ''\uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  suggested someone kill Sec. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 . We must take people at their word.''\par \par \uc2 A Secret Service spokesman, who refused to identify himself, said that the agency was ''aware of the comments'' but did not elaborate.\par \par \uc2 Others seized on Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's remark as an occasion for mockery. Senator Elizabeth Warren, Democrat of Massachusetts, wrote on \uc2 Twitter\uc2  that Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  ''makes death threats because he's a pathetic coward who can't handle the fact that he's losing to a girl.''\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's campaign events have grown increasingly vitriolic, with angry chants and jeers directed at Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 . People at his rallies have, with greater frequency, loudly called for violence against Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  -- catcalls that Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  has generally let pass.\par \par \uc2 And on Saturday, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  praised his New Hampshire state co-chairman, State Representative Al Baldasaro, who said recently that Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  deserved to face a firing squad over the F.B.I.'s investigation of her use of a private email server while she was secretary of state.\par \par \uc2 In Wilmington on Tuesday, chants of ''lock her up,'' which first gained traction during the Republican National Convention, were loud and frequent before Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  took the stage. But one speaker, former Mayor \uc2 Rudolph W. Giuliani\uc2  of New York, tried to tamp those down.\par \par \uc2 ''No, no, we're here to beat her, and keep her out of Washington,'' Mr. Giuliani said. He was interrupted by the same chant minutes later.\par \par \uc2 Find out what you need to know about the 2016 presidential race today, and get politics news updates via \uc2 Facebook\uc2 , \uc2 Twitter\uc2  and the First Draft newsletter.\par \par \uc2 Correction: August 11, 2016, Thursday\par \par \uc2 This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article on Wednesday about \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's remarks about \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  and gun control misidentified the position held by Al Baldasaro, a New Hampshire lawmaker who supports Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , and who recently said that Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  deserved to face a firing squad over the use of a private email server. Mr. Baldasaro is a state representative, not a state senator.\par \par \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2  at a rally on Tuesday in North Carolina.

\par\par \b \uc2 Election\uc2  2016: Newcomers Reshape a Battleground State\b0\par\par\uc2 By Janet Adamy and Paul Overberg   \par \uc2 734 \uc2 words\par \uc2 10 August 2016\par \uc2 The Wall Street Journal\par \uc2 J\par A4\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   \par \par \uc2 CHARLOTTE, N.C. -- The technology workers, accountants and bankers who packed a steamy roof deck for a young professionals' happy hour here recently shared one thing in common. "People aren't from here," said Ryan Apt, a 31-year-old salesman from Oklahoma who moved to Charlotte last year with his wife.\par \par \uc2 So many new residents have streamed into North Carolina in recent years that its electorate is experiencing one of the most dramatic churn rates of any state in the country. A Wall Street Journal analysis of census data shows about 1 in 10 people eligible to cast ballots this fall didn't live in the state as recently as 2008. Only Florida, California and Texas have drawn morenewadult citizensin recent years.\par \par \uc2 Like Colorado, Virginia and other magnets for outsiders, North Carolina is a battleground state where newcomers could help decide the 2016 presidential \uc2 election\uc2 . The state was reliably Republican terrain until \uc2 Barack Obama\uc2  in 2008 became the first Democrat to win there in 32 years. \uc2 Mitt Romney\uc2  snatched it back for Republicans in 2012, making it perhaps the most closely divided swing state in the country this year.\par \par \uc2 Polls show Democrat \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2  and Republican \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  running essentially even in North Carolina, a state Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  would need to preserve his most plausible path to the White House.Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  went to the retiree mecca and beach town of Wilmington on Tuesday to rally support for his economic plan, and to Fayetteville, home of the \uc2 U.S. Army\uc2 's Fort Bragg, the nation's biggest military installation.\par \par \uc2 A surge of independent voters from the Northeast and Midwest is a main reason for the state's electoral turn. Political scientists call them "shadow Democrats" because polling data suggest they have leaned left in recent elections.\par \par \uc2 In North Carolina, the big question is how newcomers' increasing numbers will stack up against conservatives who dominate the state's rural areas,where working-class whites appear energized by Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's candidacy, and suburbs, where higher-educated conservatives are uneasy about the businessman.\par \par \uc2 Eligible voters who have moved to North Carolina in recent years are younger, more highly educated, less likely to be married, more Latino and more Asian than the existing population, said Rebecca Tippett, who directs Carolina Demography at the \uc2 University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Among people born in North Carolina, 44% are registered as Democrats, 31% as Republicans and 24% as unaffiliated, according to Julyvoterdata analyzed by Michael Bitzer, a political scientist at Catawba College in Salisbury, N.C.\par \par \uc2 For those living in North Carolina but born in NewYork, the No. 1 out-of-state birthplace, 40% are Democrats, 26% are Republicans and 34% are unaffiliated. Residents born in any other state are more likely to be registered as independents than those born in North Carolina, his figures show.\par \par \uc2 While the state's urban areas have boomed, many of the rural communities that make up much of North Carolina have withered, fueling a simmering urban-rural divide. Those tensions recently boiled over when the Republican-controlled Legislature and governor blocked efforts by Charlotte's Democratic city government to let transgender people use the bathroom of their choice.\par \par \uc2 In Charlotte, a onetime gold-rush town in Mecklenburg County that grew into a banking hub in the late 20th century, a two-decade influx ofnewemployers and transplants has reshaped the city's economic and political landscape. .\par \par \uc2 Since 2008, Mecklenburg County's population has grown 16.1% to 1.03 million, while North Carolina's has risen 8.9% to 10.04 million, census figures show. About one-third of the state's population lives in rural areas, Ms. Tippett said.\par \par \uc2 Many rural residents feel excluded from the economic gains cities are enjoying, said Chris Cooper, head of the political science and public affairs department at \uc2 Western Carolina University\uc2  in Cullowhee, N.C.\par \par \uc2 Republican leaders say they are optimistic about taking the state this fallbecause of enthusiasm among rural residents who have sat out previous elections, disaffected Democrats and workers in towns that lost factories.\par \par \uc2 Democratic leaders are zeroing in on registeringnewarrivals and Latinos upset about Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's anti-immigrant stances. One goal is to register every college freshman in the area, said Matt Newton, chairman of the Mecklenburg County Democrats.\par \par {\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw262\pich650\picscaley75\picscalex75\picwgoal5240\pichgoal13000

\par\par \uc2 EDITORIAL\par \uc2 Editorial Desk; SECTA\par \b \uc2 Further Into the Muck With Mr. \uc2 Trump\b0\par\par\uc2 By THE EDITORIAL BOARD \par \uc2 505 \uc2 words\par \uc2 10 August 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 18\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Three months from the presidential \uc2 election\uc2 , and one day after his running mate promised ''specific policy proposals for how we rebuild this country at home and abroad,'' Americans find themselves asking whether \uc2 Donald \uc2 Trump\uc2  has called for the assassination of \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 On Tuesday at a rally in North Carolina, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  falsely charged, as he has before, that ''Hillary wants to abolish, essentially abolish, the Second Amendment.'' Then he added: ''If she gets to pick her judges, nothing you can do, folks. Although the Second Amendment people, maybe there is, I don't know.''\par \par \uc2 Directly behind him, a supporter's jaw dropped. Afterward, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's campaign issued an utterly mystifying statement about the ''power of unification,'' suggesting that Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  was referring to the political power of Second Amendment supporters, and was not advocating violence. The \uc2 National Rifle Association\uc2 , which has endorsed Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , concurred with his statement on Supreme Court justices and did not specifically address the rest of his remarks.\par \par \uc2 Was it a threat? Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's campaign has been marked by extraordinarily combative rhetoric. At another rally, he said he would like to punch a protester in the face and see him leave ''on a stretcher.'' His supporters have shouted ''kill her'' when he mentions Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 . The Republican convention heard cries of ''lock her up.'' A New Hampshire delegate, Al Baldasaro, called for Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2  to ''be put in the firing line and shot for treason.''\par \par \uc2 That comment wound up on the Secret Service's radar. Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's comment should as well.\par \par \uc2 Seldom, if ever, have Americans been exposed to a candidate so willing to descend to the depths of bigotry and intolerance as Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 . That he would make Tuesday's comment amid sinking poll numbers and a wave of Republican defections suggests that when bathed in the adulation of a crowd, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  is unable to control himself.\par \par \uc2 Just eight years ago, Senator \uc2 John McCain\uc2  of Arizona, then the Republican presidential nominee, told a man at a town hall session who said he was ''scared'' of an Obama presidency that Mr. Obama ''is a decent person and a person that you do not have to be scared as president of the United States.''\par \par \uc2 Twenty minutes later, a woman told Mr. McCain that she couldn't trust Mr. Obama because ''he's an Arab.'' ''No ma'am,'' Mr. McCain replied. ''He's a decent family man, a citizen, that I just happen to have disagreements with on fundamental issues. And that's what this campaign is all about.''\par \par \uc2 Republicans would do well to summon the integrity that Mr. McCain showed in 2008, and not just to give some sense of decency to this ugly campaign.

\par\par \uc2 Express; SECT\par \b \uc2 Is \uc2 Trump\uc2  Mentally Fit? 'Sure,' Gingrich Says\b0\par\par\uc2 By LIAM STACK \par \uc2 564 \uc2 words\par \uc2 10 August 2016\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 The New York Times on the Web\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Does \uc2 Newt Gingrich\uc2 , the former Republican House speaker and one-time vice-presidential hopeful, think \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2  has the mental fitness to be president of the United States? His answer in an interview on Monday was not very convincing.\par \par \uc2 ''Yeah, and my answer would be, sure,'' Mr. Gingrich said, after a sigh and a pause, in an interview for the first episode of ''The Run-Up,'' a new politics podcast from The \uc2 New York Times\uc2  that was broadcast on Tuesday.\par \par \uc2 The former speaker declined to give a more emphatic endorsement of Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's psychological sturdiness when the interviewer, Michael Barbaro, asked if he could ''be more forceful than 'sure.' ''\par \par \uc2 Instead, Mr. Gingrich said he believed Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  was ''at least as reliable as Andrew Jackson'' and praised him for possessing ''a personality which will by definition not be normal.''\par \par \uc2 Here is a transcript of the exchange:\par \par \uc2 BARBARO: Does he have the mental fitness, the kind of psychological suitability to the office of the presidency?\par \par \uc2 GINGRICH: [pause] Yeah, and my answer would be, sure.\par \par \uc2 BARBARO: Sure?\par \par \uc2 GINGRICH: Sure. I mean, he is at least as reliable as Andrew Jackson, who was one of the most decisive presidents in American history. Nobody would have predicted Abraham Lincoln's capabilities before he became president, and most people didn't believe him while he was president.\par \par \uc2 BARBARO: Can you be more forceful than ''sure''?\par \par \uc2 GINGRICH: [pause] I think that \uc2 Trump\uc2  has a willingness to break up a system which is decaying. I think the kind of personality that is prepared to be outside the total establishment and have the self-confidence to take on the establishment of both parties is a personality which will by definition not be normal. It will not be a good, corporate managerial, go-along-and-get-along kind of guy, and that's what you guys mean by temperament.\par \par \uc2 (Andrew Jackson was last in the news when the Treasury Department decided in April that the former president, a slaveholder known today for both his persecution of Native Americans and advocacy for poor whites, would share the $20 bill with the former slave and abolitionist Harriet Tubman.)\par \par \uc2 Questions have mounted among both Democrats and Republicans about whether Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  possesses the mental fitness and strength of character to serve as president, and his poll numbers have fallen as a result.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Gingrich acknowledged Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 's trouble in his interview with ''The Run-Up.'' ''The last two weeks have been peculiarly bad for \uc2 Trump\uc2 ,'' he said.\par \par \uc2 Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  has appeared to inflict much of that damage upon himself, including by engaging in a days-long feud with the parents of a fallen United States soldier who criticized him at the Democratic National Convention, confounding many of his supporters.\par \par \uc2 As his numbers have fallen and his troubles have grown, some Republican officials have begun to publicly reject his candidacy.\par \par \uc2 On Monday Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine, said she would not vote for Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , citing his ''constant stream of cruel comments and his inability to admit error or apologize'' to those he has attacked. Earlier that day, 50 national security officials who served in Republican administrations signed an open letter warning that he ''would put at risk our country's national security and well-being'' if he won the \uc2 election\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Document NYTF000020160810ec8a0006n\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 As it heads into its 42nd season and an autumn that is teeming with potential for political satire, ''Saturday Night Live'' is undergoing some visible changes and shedding three performers from its ensemble.\par \par \uc2 Taran Killam and Jay Pharoah, principal cast members who had been with ''S.N.L.'' since 2010 and contributed many key impersonations on the program, are both leaving the show, as is Jon Rudnitsky, a featured player who appeared during the 2015-16 season.\par \par \uc2 Their departures were confirmed by Lauren Roseman, a press representative for NBC.\par \par \uc2 Presidential contests tend to bring added focus and intensity to ''S.N.L.,'' which will have its season premiere on Oct. 1. That NBC sketch comedy series is renowned for its sendups of the electoral horse race, its lampooning of political figures and appearances from their real-life counterparts.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Killam, who was promoted to the main cast of ''S.N.L.'' in 2012, had contributed impressions of Senator Ted Cruz of Texas and House Speaker Paul D. Ryan. Mr. Killam had briefly played the Republican presidential nominee, \uc2 Donald J. \uc2 Trump\uc2 , but ceded that role to Darrell Hammond, who has played Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  for several decades.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Pharoah, who was also promoted to the main cast in 2012, had been the show's resident impersonator of President Obama and Ben Carson.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Killam, an alumnus of the Groundlings comedy troupe and a star of films like ''The Heat,'' told the website Uproxx that, though he still had one year remaining on his seven-year contract, he was not being brought back to the show.\par \par \uc2 ''I had sort of had it in my head I would make this upcoming year my last year, but then heard they weren't going to pick up my contract,'' Mr. Killam said in the Uproxx interview. ''I was never given a reason why, really. I can assume until the cows come home.''\par \par \uc2 A representative for Mr. Pharoah declined to comment. Representatives for Mr. Rudnitsky also declined to comment.\par \par \uc2 While these changes hardly represent a complete overhaul, they are among the more significant at ''S.N.L.'' in recent years.\par \par \uc2 Its 39th season, which concluded in the spring of 2014, was the last for the main cast members Seth Meyers (now the host of NBC's ''Late Night'') and Nasim Pedrad, as well as several featured players. After its 2012-13 season, the show said goodbye to Fred Armisen, Bill Hader and Jason Sudeikis, while Kristen Wiig, Andy Samberg and Abby Elliott left after the 2011-12 season.\par \par \uc2 ''S.N.L.'' producers continue to spend the summer scouting for talent, and the show is expected to make new hires for the fall, though NBC gave no indication on Tuesday of who was being considered or how many cast members might join.\par \par \uc2 The show still has a go-to impressionist for \uc2 Hillary \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , the Democratic presidential nominee, who has been played by Kate McKinnon, a star of this summer's ''Ghostbusters'' reboot.\par \par \uc2 (Meanwhile, Leslie Jones, Ms. McKinnon's ''S.N.L'' and ''Ghostbusters'' co-star, has also seen her status rise this summer, and has been added to NBC's coverage of the 2016 Summer Olympics after following the Games in an unofficial capacity on her \uc2 Twitter\uc2  account.)\par \par \uc2 In 2008 and 2012, ''Saturday Night Live'' broadcast additional episodes on Thursday nights, emphasizing political comedy, in the weeks before \uc2 Election\uc2  Day, though NBC has not announced similar plans for this year.\par \par \uc2 Last season, Mr. \uc2 Trump\uc2  hosted ''S.N.L.'' on Nov. 7, 2015, while he was still vying for the Republican presidential nomination. Mrs. \uc2 Clinton\uc2 , while still contending for the Democratic nomination, appeared in a sketch with Ms. McKinnon on the Oct. 3, 2015, broadcast.\par \par \uc2 Taran Killam, left, and Jay Pharoah, who had both been with the show since 2010. \par \par \uc2 Document NYTF000020160810ec8a0005w\par }\par \b \uc2 Search Summary\b0\par \par  \trowd\trgaph15\trqc\trleft-15
